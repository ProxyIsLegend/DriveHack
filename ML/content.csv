As we reported early this month,big tech companies lost more than $1 trillion in market value in just three trading days asturmoil in the stock market continues. Now, the carnage is slowly spreading to tech startup companies. Two of the biggest hit technology sectors are fintech and the online delivery space.Fears of a looming recession are forcing tech startups in the grocery delivery space to slow their hiring and slam the brakes on growth. This week, Istanbul-based Getir and Berlin-based Gorillas,two of the largest instant grocery apps,announced plans to lay off hundreds of staff. London-based Zapp, another grocery delivery startup, said it’s planning to reduce the staff count of its U.K. team. Getir told employees on Wednesday that it plans to reduce its global headcount by 14%. The startup currently employs more than 6,000 people worldwide, according to its LinkedIn profile. Gorillas says that it will let go of around 300 people. The 2-year-old startup is also mulling an exit from Italy, Spain, Denmark and Belgium and whether to shift its focus to more profitable markets such as the U.S., U.K., and Germany. In an emailed statement to the company’s employees, the startup said: “With a heavy heart, we today shared with our team the saddening and difficult decision to reduce the size of our global organization.We will also decrease spending on marketing investments, promotions, and expansion.” Gorillas on Tuesday said it was making the “extremely hard decision” to let go of about 300 of its employees, citing the need to reach profitability in the long run. “These are necessary moves that will help Gorillas to become a stronger and more profitable business with a sharpened focus on its customers and its brand,” Gorillas said in a statement. We wrote about Gorillas back in October 2021 after it raised $1 billion in funding led by Delivery Hero.Getir and Gorillas have raised $1.8 billion and $1.3 billion to date, respectively. Getir scored a $12 billion valuation in March, while Gorillas was last valued at $3 billion. Both firms have burned through significant amounts of cash to expand in the U.S. Meanwhile, Zapp on Wednesday confirmed reports that it is considering making layoffs of up to 10% of staff. A final decision hasn’t yet been made as a consultation is underway with the firm’s U.K. employees. “The current macroeconomic climate has become incredibly challenging, with very little visibility of when things will improve. This uncertainty is seeing investors reduce their risk appetite considerably, favoring profitability overgrowth. As a venture-backed scale-up that will need to fundraise again in the future, we, therefore, need to adjust our business plan to reduce costs and accelerate our path to profitability,”a company spokesperson said. Founded in May 2020 byJörg Kattner, Kağan Sümer, and Ronny Shibley,Gorillas is a grocery delivery provider as it aims to aggregate supermarket product ranges delivered to consumers within 10 minutes of ordering. The startup has grown at a rapid clip as demand for its service took off during the coronavirus pandemic. Gorillas isone of the dozens of European startups competing in an increasingly crowded space. Others include Turkish company Getir, British firm Zapp, and German peer Flink."

2022.5.28,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.5.28,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.5.28,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness.

2022.5.29,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/05/29/duckduckgo-caught-giving-microsoft-trackers-permission-track-users-third-party-sites-despite-strong-privacy-protection-claim/,"For many of you who have been following us over the years, you’re well aware of the fact that we’ve been promoting DuckDuckGo as an alternative to Google’s search engine due to its strong reputation for privacy.DuckDuckGo is well-known for its privacy-first commitment to users who’re tired of being tracked online. However, that changed this week afterBleeping Computer reported that the DuckDuckGobrowser purposely allows Microsoft trackers to track users on third-party sites due to its agreement in its syndicated search content contract between the two companies. According to Bleeping Computer, security researcher Zach Edwards posted on Twitter that “while DuckDuckGo blocks Google and Facebook trackers, it allowed Microsoft trackers to continue running.” The company explains that “this issue is occurring on browsers and only pertains to non-DuckDuckGo websites.” That wasn’t all. Edwards also provided proof in a post on Twitter. In a tweet, he said: “I tested the DuckDuckGo so-called private browser for both iOS and Android, yet *neither version* blocked data transfers to Microsoft’s Linkedin + Bing ads while viewing Facebook’s workplace[.]com homepage.Look at DDG bragging about stopping Facebook on Workplace, no MSFT..:” In another tweet, Edwards also added: “You can capture data within the DuckDuckGo so-called private browser on a website like Facebook’s http://workplace.com and you’ll see that DDG does NOT stop data flows to Microsoft’s Linkedin domains or their Bing advertising domains.iOS + Android proof:” https://twitter.com/thezedwards/status/1528808795983319041 The news quickly made its round on social media and was reported on several media outlets. Over the weekend, the news got the attention of DuckDuckGo CEOGabriel Weinberg later took to Twitter on Saturday to refute the claim. In a statement sent to multiple media outlets and also shared on Reddit, DuckDuckGo CEO Weinberg said: “We have always been extremely careful to never promise anonymity when browsing, because that frankly isn’t possible given how quickly trackers change how they work to evade protections and the tools we currently offer. When most other browsers on the market talk about tracking protection they are usually referring to 3rd-party cookie protection and fingerprinting protection, and our browsers for iOS, Android, and our new Mac beta, impose these restrictions on third-party tracking scripts, including those from Microsoft. What we’re talking about here is an above-and-beyond protection that most browsers don’t even attempt to do — that is, blocking third-party tracking scripts before they load on 3rd party websites. Because we’re doing this where we can, users are still getting significantly more privacy protection with DuckDuckGo than they would using Safari, Firefox and other browsers. This blog post we published gets into the real benefits users enjoy from this approach, like faster load times (46% average decrease) and less data transferred (34% average decrease). Our goal has always been to provide the most privacy we can in one download, by default without any complicated settings.” Linking to a Reddit thread, Weinberg said in a tweet:“FYI — this is a quite misleading headline since this isn’t about our search engine and we actually restrict Microsoft scripts in our browsers, including blocking their 3rd party cookies. For full context, I left detailed explanation on reddit: FYI — this is a quite misleading headline since this isn't about our search engine and we actually restrict Microsoft scripts in our browsers, including blocking their 3rd party cookies. For full context, I left detailed explanation on reddit:https://t.co/AfDSKceldw — Gabriel Weinberg (@yegg) May 29, 2022  Unfortunately, while users on Reddit appeared to be more sympathetic to Weinberg’s, users YCombinator Hacker News forum weren’t buying any of it. On YCombinator said this aboutWeinberg’s claim that “this is not about search,” saying: “Your competitors in the privacy-centric browser space don’t have this restrictionbecause they’re not search engines acquiring the majority of their data from an entity with a conflicting interest.” Another YCombinator user replied: “The thread by the security engineer shows that the scripts are communicating back to the servers. That means your multi-pronged protection has failed, unless you’ve suddenly discovered a way for browsers to block IP addresses from being sent by scripts (and since they can be extracted from the request itself that doesn’t seem likely).”  DuckDuckGo came into prominence in early 2020 after the privacy-focused search engine expanded beyond its own site and started to offer mobile apps for Android and iOS. The search engine also has a dedicated Chrome extension. In a September 2020 tweet, DDG said more than 4 million users installed these apps and extensions. On January 18, 2021, we wrote about DuckDuckGo after it announced that it recorded its first-ever day with more than 100 million user search queries,a major milestone since its inception 12 years ago. The historic came in the same week WhatsApp competitors Signal and Telegram also reported a massive increase in downloads after WhatsApp says it will share data with Facebook. Below isWeinberg’s full text on Reddit. DuckDuckGo Hi, I’m the CEO & Founder of DuckDuckGo. To be clear (since I already see confusion in the comments), when you load our search results, you are anonymous, including ads. Also on 3rd-party websites we actually do block Microsoft 3rd-party cookies in our browsers plus more protections including fingerprinting protection. That is, this article is not about our search engine, but about our browsers — we have browsers (really all-in-one privacy apps) for iOS, Android, and now Mac (in beta). When most other browsers on the market talk about tracking protection they are usually referring to 3rd-party cookie protection and fingerprinting protection, and our browsers impose these same restrictions on all third-party tracking scripts, including those from Microsoft. We also have a lot of other above-and-beyond web protections that also apply to Microsoft scripts (and everyone else), e.g., Global Privacy Control, first-party cookie expiration, referrer header trimming, new cookie consent handling (in our Mac beta), fire button (one-click) data clearing, and more. What this article is talking about specifically is another above-and-beyond protection that most browsers don’t even attempt to do for web protection— stopping third-party tracking scripts from even loading on third-party websites — because this can easily cause websites to break. But we’ve taken on that challenge because it makes for better privacy, and faster downloads — we wrote a blog post about it here. Because we’re doing this above-and-beyond protection where we can, and offer many other unique protections (e.g., Google AMP/FLEDGE/Topics protection, automatic HTTPS upgrading, tracking protection for *other* apps in Android, email protection to block trackers for emails sent to your regular inbox, etc.), users get way more privacy protection with our app than they would using other browsers. Our goal has always been to provide the most privacy we can in one download. The issue at hand is, while most of our protections like 3rd-party cookie blocking apply to Microsoft scripts on 3rd-party sites (again, this is off of DuckDuckGo,com, i.e., not related to search), we are currently contractually restricted by Microsoft from completely stopping them from loading (the one above-and-beyond protection explained in the last paragraph) on 3rd party sites. We still restrict them though (e.g., no 3rd party cookies allowed). The original example was Workplace.com loading a LinkedIn.com script. Nevertheless, we have been and are working with Microsoft as we speak to reduce or remove this limited restriction. I understand this is all rather confusing because it is a search syndication contract that is preventing us from doing a non-search thing. That’s because our product is a bundle of multiple privacy protections, and this is a distribution requirement imposed on us as part of the search syndication agreement that helps us privately use some Bing results to provide you with better private search results overall. While a lot of what you see on our results page privately incorporates content from other sources, including our own indexes (e.g., Wikipedia, Local listings, Sports, etc.), we source most of our traditional links and images privately from Bing (though because of other search technology our link and image results still may look different). Really only two companies (Google and Microsoft) have a high-quality global web link index (because I believe it costs upwards of a billion dollars a year to do), and so literally every other global search engine needs to bootstrap with one or both of them to provide a mainstream search product. The same is true for maps btw — only the biggest companies can similarly afford to put satellites up and send ground cars to take streetview pictures of every neighborhood. Anyway, I hope this provides some helpful context. Taking a step back, I know our product is not perfect and will never be. Nothing can provide 100% protection. And we face many constraints: platform constraints (we can’t offer all protections on every platform do to limited APIs or other restrictions), limited contractual constraints (like in this case), breakage constraints (blocking some things totally breaks web experiences), and of course the evolving tracking arms race that we constantly work to keep ahead of. That’s why we have always been extremely careful to never promise anonymity when browsing outside our search engine, because that frankly isn’t possible. We’re also working on updates to our app store descriptions to make this more clear. Holistically though I believe what we offer is the best thing out there for mainstream users who want simple privacy protection without breaking things, and that is our product vision."

Musk also suggested in a tweet that 20% of Twitter users are fake/spam accounts. It now appears that Musk was right all along–More than 5% of Twitter users are fake or spam. According to a new study published on Monday byIsraeli cybersecurity company CHEQ, “Up to 12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.”CHEQ found that11.71% of all website visits originating from Twitter were by bots or fake users, Jerusalem Post reported, citing the company. CHEQ added that the bots include spambots, scrapers, botnets, click farms, and automation tools, as well as other forms of fake, fraudulent, and non-human traffic. As part of the study,CHEQ usedover 2,000 different cybersecurity tests to determine the authenticity of Twitter users. The study later concluded that “Out of 5.21 million website visits analyzed by CHEQ, 617,000 were determined to be ‘invalid,’ meaning it was most likely driven by non-human traffic.” “The data suggests that Twitter’s bot problem is probably larger than 5%.” In a statement,Guy Tytunovich, founder and CEO of CHEQ said: “Our study looked into users who came from Twitter to other websites,” Guy Tytunovich, founder and CEO of CHEQ, said. “But,” he continued, “if you consider that many bots don’t click through to other sites and only stay on Twitter, then it seems very likely that bot traffic inside the platform itself could be significantly higher than 12%.” We’re living in the “era of fake web,” Tytunovich declared, where “bots, malicious users and automation tools make up a large portion of all web traffic.”Tytunovich added, “Ultimately, we’re living in the era of the fake web” Meanwhile, in a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” He added: “Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of 5%.

One of those startups isNXRT, a Vienna, Austrian-based provider of a simulation platform for the automotive and railway sectors. Today,NXRT announced it has raised an additional $2.3 million (€3.6 2.1 million) toopen up additional markets and progress even faster from a solution provider to a platform provider.The latest cash infusion brings NXRT’s total funding raisedto $3.9 million (€3.6 million). The round was backed by well-known entrepreneurs including Hermann Hauser and the Tricentis founders Wolfgang Platz and Franz Fuchsberger, and the venture capitalist eQventure.The fresh money brings NXRT an important step further on the way to becoming a global simulation platform for immersive testing, training, and sales solutions. NXRT started out in2014 after Patrick Kolar (CTO) and Alexis Kopciak (CIO) developed Europe’s first VR-based driving school simulator at St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences. In the following years, they invested time and money in research and development and, together with the co-founders Lukas Stranger (CEO) and Martin Wagner (CSO), built the first VR simulator for driving schools. A showcase with Mercedes Benz Austria and the development of the world’s first VR-simulator in a real car followed in 2017. Since its official foundation in 2019, NXRT has started cooperation with Porsche AG, Magna, RSRH, and the ÖAMTC in 2020. In 2021, the core product also became available for the railway industry. Commenting on the funding NXRT CEOLukas Stranger said, “Our platform provides the automotive and rail industry with the tools they need to develop simulation solutions independently. With this financing, we can open up additional markets and progress even faster from a solution provider to a platform provider.” Stranger added, “With NXRT, customers not only benefit from a solution but from a platform that they can expand independently and scale almost infinitely,” emphasizes Franz Fuchsberger, Senior Partner at eQventure. Current customers include Porsche, Hyundai, Audi, Rhomberg Sersa Vossloh, and Rail4mation.” Hermann Hauser, one of the investors in eQventure, added:“Through the combination of in-depth knowledge of the industry and high-end technology, the team around Lukas Stranger and Martin Wagner succeeded in realistically simulating all kinds of driving situations. Our financing flows into a solid company that not only renders valuable services to the automotive and railway industries but also contributes to road safety in general.” To date, automotive and rail companies can leverage the NXRT development platform, and develop test, training, and sales solutions independently: With the underlying ecosystem of software tools, this can be done easily and efficiently using drag and drop. This makes it easy to combine individual simulation environments. The connection with virtual or mixed reality further increases the degree of reality. NXRT is also used in the automotive industry. With NXRT, you get in the car, put on the VR glasses (Virtual Reality), buckle up, and you’re off you go on the interactive journey. MR-simulations (Mixed Reality) via the VR headset’s micro camera keep your hands and the interior of the car visible, ensuring even more authenticity. NXRT creates new opportunities in the training of sales teams as well as in sales and engineering via virtual test drives. In addition, car manufacturers and their dealers and training centers receive a safe and real possibility of simulating expensive driver assistance systems. In the railway sector, the focus is on simulators for the training and further education of drivers, shunting, and safety personnel. NXRT creates an interactive environment for training from everyday scenarios to extreme situations. The digitization of the complex railway infrastructure and 3D-visualization of switches through to selective route sections save the purchase of expensive training hardware, makes the training more lively, and creates new opportunities in training."
2022.5.30,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/05/30/candela-unveils-electric-flying-passenger-boat-zero-emissions-debuts-p-8-voyager-venice/,"Candela is a Swedish tech startup and maker ofelectric flying passenger boats with zero emissions. Unlike conventionalspeedboats with big combustion engines that use huge amounts of gasoline, Candelaelectric flying passenger boat emits no waste products that pollute the environment or disrupt the climate. Candela first made the debut of the world’s first flying electric-powered hydrofoil speedboat in September 2020on Switzerland’s lakes.With zero emissions, the Candela Seven can hit speeds of 55 km per hour when its foils lift it out of the water. As we reported back in March,Candela entered the US market with the opening of its first US test drive center in San Francisco to demonstrate its revolutionary hydrofoiling boats. Today,Candela unveiled the next generation of its electric passenger boats in Venice. The new foiling Candela P-8 Voyager lets its passengers travel silently and comfortably through wake-sensitive areas or over delicate coral reefs, without leaving a trace. To fully appreciate the efficiency of Candela P-8 Voyager, it’s important to first understand howconventional taxi boats or yacht tenders with big combustion engines work.As their hulls displace water, waves are formed that erode shorelines and damage coral reefs and other sensitive ecosystems. Other problems include oil spills, emissions, and sound pollution. According to reports on the Great Barrier Reef, the noise from boat engines can even cause fish to die prematurely from stress. With all the adverse effects of the conventional speedboats and the problems they posed to the environment,there has been no sustainable alternative – that is, up until now. To date,Candela isthe fastest electric craft, with the longest range – yet it uses a staggering 80% less energy than traditional powerboats at high speeds. The startup issetting new standards for electric vessels with its hydrofoiling, long-range electric craft. The wake of P-8 Voyager is only 5 cm high, thanks to the efficiency of Candela’s hydrofoils. Gliding silently across the water, Candela’s P-8 Voyager barely leaves a trace on the water’s surface. Its hydrodynamically shaped foils form a tiny 5 cm high wake that is hardly noticeable by marine creatures or causes erosion to beaches or coral reefs. Yet, with its Candela C-POD motor at full rev, it tops out at 30 knots and has a range of 50 nautical miles at cruise speed – going faster and further than any other electric boat. And it doesn’t have to slow down for waves either: 4-foot swells will hardly be noticeable for passengers enjoying the scenery from their air-conditioned panorama cabin. The P-8 Voyager carries six passengers and two crew. The P-8 Voyager is built in Sweden using Candela’s computer-guided foils, or underwater wings, that reduce energy consumption by 80% compared to traditional motorboats. Gliding above the friction of water, the P-8 Voyager draws only about 25 kW from its Candela C-POD motor when cruising at 20 knots. The hydrofoils are the key to achieving long-range and high speed in electric boats – the P-8 Voyager has 2-3 times longer range than any other electric speedboat – but the technology’s big boon is to the fragile marine environment and its inhabitants. “From Venice to the Bahamas, it’s absurd to travel in beautiful and fragile ecosystems in speedboats that burn 200 liters of petrol per hour and make huge wakes. With the Candela P-8 Voyager, we wanted to make a no-compromise electric exploration vessel. You have the performance, and can cruise for well over 2 hours, but there’s virtually no negative impact on the environment,” says Erik Eklund, Candela’s Chief Executive of Commercial Vessels. For passengers traveling in P-8 Voyager’s air-conditioned cabin, seasickness is a thing of the past. The computer-guided hydrofoils ensure a smooth ride even in waves. The P-8 Voyager has been developed specifically to replace the world’s fleets of smaller and fast combustion engine passenger craft – yacht tenders, taxis, and rigid inflatable boats. Founded in 2014, theStockholm-based Candela is known for its revolutionary hydrofoiling electric vessels. From the Candela C-8 leisure boat (which also is debuting at Salone Nautico in Venice) to the flying electric ferries for the City of Stockholm, the Swedish marine tech company is rethinking and redefining waterborne transport. The C-FOIL hydrofoil system on Candela P-8 Voyager has been developed by Candela’s 50+ engineers with experience from the drone, aerospace, and software industries. At 16 knots, the onboard Flight controller automatically changes the foil’s angle of attack to provide the lift needed for take-off. Once foilborne, the Flight controller relies on various sensors to gauge wave height and ensure a smooth flight even in adverse conditions. Reacting in real-time – adjustments to roll, pitch, and height are made 100 times per second – the system can fly in 4 to 5-foot chop without slamming.  Below is a teaser video of Candela P-8 Voyager."

Unknown to us, the Ankr team has been busy working onMeta Apes, a free-to-play, play-and-earn MMO strategy game. Today, Ankr announcedMeta Apeshas become the first game to go live on the BNB Application Sidechain (BAS). Meta Apes is now available for Android devices on Google Play, with the iOS app coming in the near future. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity has vanished and a new era ruled by Apes has begun. Next on the agenda is space domination. Each player will have to work closely with his or her Gang to become the strongest Clan and win the ultimate race to space. “Meta Apes was born out of this idea of creating a community-oriented game that offers both audiences something valuable – 1) an opportunity for the traditional gamers to earn & truly own their in-game assets and 2) a much more interactive and enjoyable experience to the blockchain gamers who are primarily looking to earn,” said Taylor Shim, Business Lead at Meta Apes. She added, “Building on an application-focused sidechain helps us avoid a lot of the common issues seen in blockchain gaming like network congestion and giving us a lot more flexibility in terms of game design & tokenomics.” Using Ankr’s gaming software development kit (SDK), Meta Apes has combined the fun gameplay that users love in Web2 with the incentives and monetization mechanisms that are an integral part of Web3. With full Web3 capabilities, enhanced scalability, and intuitive game mechanics, Meta Apes has upped the ante in blockchain gaming. Blockchain integration means it will include in-game cryptocurrencies, NFT characters, and true digital ownership. The game-related data lives on the blockchain instead of a centralized server controlled by a gaming studio. With true ownership, players are able to trade or sell their in-game assets freely and also earn while playing. Ankr also helped build the BNB Application Sidechain (BAS), which enables developers to create and operate their own blockchains running parallel to the BNB Chain mainnet. With dedicated sidechains, apps and games like Meta Apes will have much higher throughput and extremely low transaction fees. Developers can build dedicated blockchains that suit the needs of their unique application without needing to compete with traffic coming from all the other apps running on the BNB Chain. Ankr’s new Web3 Gaming SDK gives game studios and developers everything they need to create an amazing Web3 game like Meta Apes, from best-in-class Web3 infrastructure to NFTs, marketplaces, and multi-chain wallet integrations. Its SDKs help game studios convert their Web2 games to Web3 quickly and seamlessly by adding NFTs, crypto payment gateways, and other mechanisms. It took Meta Apes only about a month to convert from Web2 to Web3 using Ankr’s Gaming SDK. Founded in 2017Chandler Song, Ryan Fang, and Stanley Wu, Ankr is a decentralized Web 3 infrastructure platform for the Web 3 World. Anker’s platform enables users to build, earn, and stake with $ANKR. Ankr currently serves an average of 6 billion blockchain requests per day across over 50 chains. Ankr helps blockchain companies and developers who build on them by providing the best infrastructure and multi-chain solutions in the industry for accessing blockchain data fast and reliably. Ankr launched the Ankr Protocol in 2021, which serves over 200B requests a month across 50+ blockchains, and is on track to be the dominant leader in RPC services."

Buffet has been consistent about his view on the world’s most popular cryptocurrency saying that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and thatcryptocurrency “doesn’t produce anything.” Unfortunately, decades of Buffet’s financial wisdom fell on deaf ears.Instead, crypto investors listened toanother billionaire: venture capitalist and tech billionaire Tim Draper. Four years ago,Tim Draper predicted bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2022. In a tweet posted on April 13, 2018, Draper said that bitcoin will reach $250,000 by 2022. That was not all. Draper also went to the population aggregation platform to confirm his prediction. “I’m thinking $250,000 a bitcoin by 2022,” Draper said onReddit. “Believe it. They’re going to think you’re crazy, but believe it. It’s happening and it’s going to be awesome!” Draper is anavowed cryptocurrency bull. Whether Draper is crazy or not is left for you to decide. All we can do is go with the crypto market data we have. Since Draper’s prediction four years ago, the highest price Bitcoin has ever recorded was a littleover $68,000 in November 2021. Since then, bitcoin has lost more than half of its value from its peak. In an initial Twitter post, he predicted a price of $25,000 by 2022 sending confusion to followers and fans. He later made a clarification, saying he now expects Bitcoin to reach $250K by 2022. “Oops! I predicted $250k in 2022. My tweet last night was missing a zero. $250k is the number!,” the tweet reads. Oops! I predicted $250k in 2022. My tweet last night was missing a zero. $250k is the number! — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) April 13, 2018  Even with bitcoin hovering between $30,000 to $60,000,Draper is still sticking by his prediction that bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2022 or early 2023 despite the cryptocurrency’s wild swings in value and the turmoil around its environmentally unfriendly energy usage. In a June 2021 interview withCNBC Make It, Draper said: “I think I’m going to be right on this one.I’m either going to be really right or really wrong [but] I’m pretty sure that it’s going in that direction.” Just seven months ago, time will tell if Draper is right or leading novice crypto investors to put their hard-earn savings into risky assets. Draper is the founding partner of Draper Associates and DFJ, an early investor in Skype and Chinese search giant Baidu.In July 2014, Draper received wide coverage for his purchase of 30,000 bitcoins at a US Marshals Service auction, from seized bitcoins from the Silk Road marketplace website. Draper is best known as the founder of the popularDraper University. His father is the founder of Draper & Johnson Investment Company and former chairman and president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Tim Draper graduated with a BS in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1980, and later earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1984.

Google Chrome has been facing increasing pressure from competing browsers as people become wary of the Google Chrome browser due to its privacy violation and unconsented tracking. Just two years ago, Google announced it was phasing out third-party cookies from its Chrome web browser. However, that has not stoppeda global hemorrhage of users from the world’s most popular browser. Millions of users are now switching to other safer and privacy-focused browsers like Mozilla Firefox, Opera, andApple’s Safari. According to a new report from AtlasVPN,Apple’s Safari browser now has more than 1 billion users. Although Google Chrome still firmly remains at the top as the most popular browser,the Atlas VPN team found that 1,006,232,879 internet users (19.16% of all internet users) now use the Safari browser, making it the second browser with over a billion users. The Apple-developed browser is automatically installed on every iPhone and Mac computer. Safari has implemented several privacy features to ensure its users’ security. Google Chrome is the most popular browser worldwide, with over 3.3 billion users. Application driven design of Chrome attracted more and more people to try out the browser. Web applications including YouTube, Drive, Calendar, Docs, Earth, Maps, and others became a gateway into Google’s ecosystem of online services. Compared to last year’s statistics, Microsoft Edge overtook Firefox for the third most popular browser with over 212 million users. Since the release of Windows 11, Microsoft set it as the default browser on all devices and made it difficult for users to change to their preferred option. Firefox browser ranks fourth with 179 million internet users. Firefox is oriented towards more privacy-concerned users as it offers quite a few features for their protection. Samsung Internet browser found on the companies’ smartphones and tablets is used by more than 149 million users. At the same time, over 108 million users are utilizing the Opera browser for their everyday tasks. Commenting on the report, a cybersecurity writer at Atlas VPN shares his thoughts on browsing safely online: “Ultimately, user cybersecurity education is the most essential for browser security. Many cyber attacks use social engineering techniques to trick users into downloading malware. Users can protect themselves from threats by adopting safe practices such as keeping browsers up to date, blocking pop-ups, and ensuring the sites they enter use HTTPS.”  To read the full article, head over to: https://atlasvpn.com/blog/apples-safari-browser-now-has-more-than-1-billion-users"

In just two years since its launch,BeReal reached the top 20 on the Apple App Store’s list of top free apps in May. It was also the fourth most downloaded app in social networking, behind only Facebook’s three main apps. Founded in 2020 byformer GoPro employee Alexis Barreyat along with Kévin Perreau, the Paris, France-based BeReal is a photo sharing app where users can spontaneously share life updates with their friends. In an already crowded photo sharing space, BeReal takes a different approach,but with a slightly different twist. According to app intelligence firm Apptopia, BeReal has seen 8 million downloads year-to-date, representing 76.5% of its lifetime installs. France (where the app is based) and the U.S. lead, with a 20.5% and 19.7% share of installs, respectively. BeReal has come with a simple yet a clever idea–BeReal prompts users to take one unedited photo of themselves once a day at a random time after receiving a push notification. Users have two minutes to take, post, and share a picture before it’s marked as late.Upon receiving the alert, the user can then see the photos their friends also posted. Then after sharing their photos, they are then rewared tosee what their friends posted for the day and are able to comment or react with an emoji. The method seems to be working. According to app analytics firmSensorTower, eReal now has10.7 million global installs to date. The app record month came in April, when it hit 3.6 million, up 157% from March, SensorTower said.  “It’s silly but I feel like it serves a different purpose than Instagram or Snapchat,” Emily, a user who’s been on the app for about two months, told CNBC on condition we not use her last name. “I have friends on it who I don’t communicate with on a regular basis but I appreciate getting a little window into what they’re doing once a day, even if it’s just sitting in front of their computer or on a walk.” For now, BeReal app is free with no ad. However, BeReal has not explained how it plans to make money. But that has not stopped investors looking for the next big winner from pouring millions into the app. Investors like what they see. According to Business Insider, BeReal currently has avaluation of over $600 million after raisingundisclosed amount of funding in over 3 rounds. BeReal is not without controversies.Minutiae, an app launched in 2017 said it first came up with the idea that BeReal is using now:“alerts that instruct users to snap whatever it is they’re doing now.” Unfortunately forMinutiae, the startup failed to patent its so-called idea.Minutiae co-founder Martin Adolfsson also told TechCrunch that BeReal “borrowed pretty heavily” from his idea."
2022.5.31,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/05/31/finnish-cybersecurity-startup-hoxhunt-raises-40m-amid-raising-cyberattack-numbers/,"With the ongoing global economic downturn, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for cash-strapped startups to raise funding to support their operations. Many have turned to capital preservation measures including layoffs to keep their business afloat. But while many technology startups are still struggling to raise new funding, that has not stopped investors and venture capital firms from pouring billions into startups in high-demand sectors like fintech, healthcare, and cybersecurity. One of thesestartups isHoxhunt, a Helsinki-based Hoxhunt is a People-First Cybersecurity Platform that protects organizations and their employees from the risk of cyberattacks. Hoxhunt also helps organizations turn their employees into their greatest cybersecurity assets. Today,Hoxhunt announced it has raised $40 million in Series B funding led by New York-based Level Equity Management, with participation by existing investor Icebreaker.vc. To date, Hoxhunt has raised $43 million in total funding including a $3M Series A and $40M Series B. Hoxhunt will use the new capital infusion to aid the development of its technology and accelerate growth in new markets, particularly North America. Founded in 2016 byMika Aalto and Pyry Åvist, HoxHunt offers enterprise-grade AI that simulates real phishing attacks on organization users. The company also features a fully automated service simulates real attacks and shows the techniques attackers use to infiltrate organizations. Employees are rewarded for reporting the attacks – both real and simulated. Since its inception six years ago,Hoxhunt has grown from four co-founders to 120-and-quickly-growing Hoxhunters globally. The startupcurrently hosts over a million end users, who receive up to 36 phishing simulations a year in 30 supported languages. Over 10 million threats have been analyzed. According to Deloitte,Hoxhunt is Finland’s fastest-growing SaaS company. Unlike other cybersecurity approaches, Hoxhunt makes good email cybersecurity a habit. Hoxhunt’s gamified platform rewards employees for reporting simulated and real email threats, using machine learning to create millions of individualized phishing simulations. Hoxhunt lightens the load for security teams who, aided by an elite customer success team, can upskill whole organizations with unprecedented engagement rates at the push of a button. Cybercrime represents an ever-worsening pandemic costing global businesses trillions of dollars per year. Email is the main vector of transmission as 90% of all breaches, from ransomware to Business Email Compromises, are initiated by a phishing email. Hoxhunt is turning the tide on phishing attacks with breakthrough innovation. Their unprecedented results are supported by hard data and glowing testimonials from partners like Microsoft and Deloitte, and customers such as DocuSign, G2, and a number of governmental agencies. “Email is the biggest threat to enterprise security; that’s why human nature is the most important cybersecurity challenge to solve, instead of building incrementally better mousetraps at the technical perimeter,” says Hoxhunt CEO Mika Aalto. “Our first-to-market platform enables measurable behavior change and cultural transformation. Our fundamentally different approach combines personalized and hyper-realistic training, adapted to each individual’s skill, role, location, and language.” The cybersecurity market has seen explosive growth over the past two years. Cybersecurity spending is projected to grow from $262.4 billion in 2022 to $458.9 billion in 2025, with tightening regulatory and insurance pressure driving higher expenditure on awareness. Cybercrime costs are projected to swell to $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. “There is tremendous growth potential in the cybersecurity awareness category, which we at Level Equity Partners are thrilled to invest in again with Hoxhunt, who we see as best-in-class in terms of innovation, product design, and leadership,” said Sarah Sommer, co-Founder and Partner at Level Equity Management. “In just two years, the number of cybersecurity unicorn companies has jumped from 6 to over 50, but too few are security awareness vendors. Next-level security training represents a huge opportunity in terms of ROI and, more importantly, doing good for the world.”"
2022.6.1,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/01/sheryl-sandberg-stepping-facebooks-meta-coo/,"Sheryl Sandberg is stepping down from her role as Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Meta Platforms, Meta CEO said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. Sandberg became Facebook COO in 2008, becoming the company’s second-highest-ranking official andNo. 2 to co-founder Facebook Zuckerberg. Four years later,she was elected to Facebook’sboard of directors tobecome the first woman to serve on the company’s board. Sandberg helped turn Facebook into one of the most powerful global tech companies with a market cap that topped $1 trillion at one point. According to the announcement,Javier Olivan, the company’s chief growth officer, will take over as COO this fall. Sandberg informed Zuckerberg about her decision to leave the this past weekend. She will continue to serve on Meta’s board of directors. “Over the next few months, Mark and I will transition my direct reports,” Sandberg said in a lengthy Facebook post discussing stepping down. Meta is also planning an internal reorganization to go along with the change, Zuckerberg said. “Looking forward, I don’t plan to replace Sheryl’s role in our existing structure. I’m not sure that would be possible since she’s a superstar who defined the COO role in her own unique way,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. Below is the full memo. “It’s the end of an era. After 14 years, my good friend and partner Sheryl Sandberg is stepping down as COO of Meta. When Sheryl joined me in 2008, I was only 23 years old and I barely knew anything about running a company. We’d built a great product — the Facebook website — but we didn’t yet have a profitable business and we were struggling to transition from a small startup to a real organization. Sheryl architected our ads business, hired great people, forged our management culture, and taught me how to run a company. She created opportunities for millions of people around the world, and she deserves the credit for so much of what Meta is today. It’s unusual for a business partnership like ours to last so long. I think ours did because Sheryl is such an amazing person, leader, partner, and friend. She cares deeply about the people in her life and she is generous about nurturing relationships and helping you grow as a person. She has taught me so much and she has been there for many of the important moments in my life, both personally and professionally. Whether going through the different transitions we’ve made as a company over the years, or when she supported me and Priscilla as we navigated challenges having children, our partnership has always been deeper than just business. I’m going to miss running this company with Sheryl. But I’m glad that she’ll continue to serve on our board of directors so we can benefit from her wisdom and experience even after she transitions out of her day-to-day management role in the coming months. Looking forward, I don’t plan to replace Sheryl’s role in our existing structure. I’m not sure that would be possible since she’s a superstar who defined the COO role in her own unique way. But even if it were possible, I think Meta has reached the point where it makes sense for our product and business groups to be more closely integrated, rather than having all the business and operations functions organized separately from our products. One of Sheryl’s greatest legacies is the incredible team she has built. Some of these leaders have already stepped up into larger roles reporting to me, like Nick Clegg as President, Global Affairs and Jennifer Newstead as Chief Legal Officer. Marne Levine, our Chief Business Officer and the top business person who handles our partnerships, will report to Javier Olivan so that our Ads and Business Platform product group will be closer to the Meta Business Group. Javi will become our next Chief Operating Officer since he will now lead our integrated ads and business products in addition to continuing to lead our infrastructure, integrity, analytics, marketing, corporate development and growth teams. But this role will be different from what Sheryl has done. It will be a more traditional COO role where Javi will be focused internally and operationally, building on his strong track record of making our execution more efficient and rigorous. As part of this, Molly Cutler, our VP Strategic Response, will join Javi’s team and report to Naomi Gleit. Justin Osofsky will report to Chris Cox. In addition to his role overseeing Global Operations and Instagram’s business organization, Justin will now take on an additional responsibility building a content team that works across business and product that will train our AI recommendation systems to help you discover the most interesting, relevant, and personalized content across Facebook and Instagram. Lori Goler, our Head of People, will now report directly to me. Maxine Williams, our Chief Diversity Officer, will continue her role on our People team, working on my staff as well. These are all talented and experienced leaders who I’ve worked closely with over the years, and I’m confident they’ll continue to do great work in this new structure. I’m sad that the day is coming when I won’t get to work as closely with Sheryl. But more than anything, I’m grateful for everything she has done to build Meta. She has done so much for me, for our community, and for the world — and we’re all better off for it.”"

The situation is even worse here in theUnited States whereabout half of all US food produce is thrown away. It’s estimated that one-third of global goes to waste,contributing to climate change, and extensive economic, environmental, and societal impacts.According to new UN research, an average of more than900 million tons of food is thrown away every year. TheFood Waste Index Report 2021also reported that between food wasted in homes, restaurants, and shops, 17 percent of all food landed in landfills. The growing awareness of food waste has also led to several global efforts to reverse the trend. The need for food waste reduction as a top climate change solution is also driving increased interest among investors to invest in the space. It’s for this reason thatReFED and Closed Loop Partners partnered on a new $100M Circular Food Solutions Funding Platformwith funding from Google and The Betsy and Jesse Fink Family Foundation. The platform, thefirst-of-its-kind,consists of three cross-cutting verticals – an$80Minvestment fund, a$10Mgrant fund[theReFED Catalytic Grant Fund],and a$10M innovation program. With an emphasis on catalytic funding, the platform is designed to provide private and philanthropic financing and other support for organizations, municipalities, and innovators that are developing solutions to help reduce the 35% of food that goes unsold or uneaten each year in the United States. According to the information on its website,ReFED’s food waste analysis estimates that “an annual investment of $14 billion over the next ten years can reduce food waste by 45 million tons each year. That investment would result in $73 billion in annual net financial benefit – a five-to-one return.” “Uneaten food is a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions, generating 4% of U.S. and 8% of global emissions annually, so the announcement of this new systems-inspired funding vehicle is an exciting milestone in the fight against climate change,” said Alexandria Coari, Vice President, Capital, Innovation & Engagement at ReFED. “Together with our partners, we’ve designed this Funding Platform to have a real impact on the amount of food going to waste, which in turn will drive reductions in greenhouse gasses. We’re inspired and humbled by the opportunity to help drive critical capital where it is needed most.” “It’s amazing to see two high impact organizations such as ReFED and Closed Loop Partners working together to pioneer a new investment vehicle, particularly one that provides catalytic capital from a mix of philanthropic funders, impact investors, and corporations,” said Jesse Fink, Trustee of the Betsy and Jesse Fink Family Foundation and a ReFED Board member. “While there has been an exciting amount of growth in the sector in recent years, it needs to happen faster, and catalytic capital deployed at scale will unlock multiples of traditional capital. This groundbreaking funding vehicle was designed with that in mind, and we are proud to be a seed investor.” Over the life of the Funding Platform, ReFED and Closed Loop Partners estimate that 10M tons of food waste could be diverted, which would result in 15M mtCO2e avoided – the equivalent of taking 300k cars off the road every year for ten years – and water savings of nearly 800B gallons. In addition to this quantified impact, ReFED and Closed Loop Partners expect the Platform to accelerate the flow of additional funding to food waste solutions Founded in 2015,ReFED is a national non-profit that uses data-driven solutions to fight food loss and waste. ReFED is working across the food system to cut food loss and waste in half by the year 2030. Closed Loop Partners is aNew York-based investment firm comprised of venture capital, growth equity, private equity, and catalytic capital, as well as an innovation center focused on building the circular economy."

The fund is backed by investment firms DST Global Partners, Breyer Capital, and Whampoa Group as well as by other private equity firms and unnamed family offices, the company said. The announcement comes just a week after Andreessen Horowitz announced a massive $4.5 billion fund to invest in crypto tech startups. Thelaunch also comes at a time when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have lost more than half of their values. For example, Bitcoin has tumbled more than 50% since reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. Binance Labs plans to use the capital to invest in companies building “Web3.” Though still an ill-defined term, Web3 loosely refers to a hypothetical future iteration of the internet that’s more decentralized than online platforms today and incorporates blockchain, the shared digital ledgers behind most major cryptocurrencies. The launch of Binance’s new fund arrives at a time when bitcoin and other digital currencies are down sharply. Bitcoin has plunged more than 50% since reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November. That’s taken a toll on publicly-listed crypto companies like Coinbase, whose shares have plunged 69% since the start of 2022. Investors fear the slump will feed through to privately-held crypto start-ups. Ken Li, Binance Labs’ executive director of investments and M&A said,“We are looking for projects with the potential to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem,” These web3 projects mostly include infrastructure, nonfungible tokens, and decentralized autonomous organizations. The crypto exchange estimates there are currently around 300,000 to 500,000 active Web3 developers, a number it hopes to grow “substantially.” Web3 isanew iteration of the Internet that incorporates decentralization based on blockchain technology. Unlike Web 2.0 where data and content are centralized in the hands of Big Tech companies, Web3 revolves around the idea of decentralization and incorporates the use of blockchain technologies, such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Domiciled in the Cayman Islands, Binance was founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao and Yi He. The exchange provides a platform for trading various cryptocurrencies. Today, Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange. Binance provides access to exchange digital currency pairs on the market while maintaining security, and liquidity, enabling a safe and efficient deal with anyone, anytime and anywhere."

Dominion Voting Systems defends its machines as “accurate and secure.” https://t.co/lbWRUytzor — The Associated Press (@AP) June 1, 2022  According to an advance copy of the advisory received byThe Associated Press, CISA identified nine vulnerabilities in the affected voting systems and recommend remediation measures to prevent future exploits. In a statement,CISA Executive Director Brandon Wales said that “states’ standard election security procedures would detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities and in many cases would prevent attempts entirely.” The advisory further suggests that statesaren’t doing enough to prevent the exploit. The agency goes on to recommend that states put in place “defensive measures to reduce the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities.” CISA is not alone in warning about the vulnerability. Several UScybersecurity groups have been warning the government about the vulnerability of U.S. election infrastructure since 2018. In 2018footage from a DEFCON hacker conference in Las Vegas, one attendee at the annual Las Vegas hacker convention revealed how voting machines used in 18 states can be compromised in two minutes without special tools or advanced knowledge.

Today,Huuva announced it has raised a $5.2 million (€4.9 million)seed round tohelp restaurants serving in underserved neighborhoods andramp up its expansion in Central Europe, recruit +100 new team members with a heavy focus on business and operations talent, and better serve the market with its unique neighborhoods-first focus. The round wasled by General Catalyst, with participation from Lifeline Ventures, and a number of angel investors including Laurel Bowden and Ilkka Paananen.General Catalyst is a US-based venture capital firm known for portfolio companies like Airbnb, Deliveroo, Snap, and Stripe. Founded in 2021 by Ville Leppälä and Ville Lehto, Huuva is on a quest to make great food available everywhere. Huuva builds delivery-focused restaurant cohorts around cities and suburbs, focusing on bringing new quality restaurant options to yet unserved neighborhoods.In just under a year the Huuva team has grown from the two founders to 45 people, 6 kitchens, 12 restaurant partners, and countless happy customers. Huuva has already partnered with several top restaurant brands in Finland, such as Via Tribunali, Green Hippo, and Pupu since its launch a year ago. “Restaurant offerings outside city centers are close to non-existent. We’re on a mission to revolutionize the restaurant offering in underserved neighborhoods. We believe that the trendiest, most popular restaurants shouldn’t be the privilege of city centers or certain hot spots – and that the neighborhoods in the city outskirts should have other high-quality options than the average multinational restaurant chains”, explains Ville Leppälä, the co-founder and CEO of Huuva.  Each of Huuva’s kitchens gathers 3-6 well-known restaurant brands under one roof, enabling consumers to order their favorite dishes from multiple brands in one delivery. Contrary to other delivery-only kitchens in the market, Huuva’s neighborhoods-first approach places its restaurant cohorts around city perimeters, bringing much-awaited new restaurant options for people outside of the busy city centers. Before setting up a new Huuva kitchen, Huuva’s team analyzes the local trends and current restaurant selection to bring the most fitting restaurants for the specific neighborhood. At the same time, Huuva considers carefully the kitchen placements and its delivery operations to put the neighborhood’s comfort first. “Our vision is to enable local entrepreneur-driven restaurant brands to scale their business without the limitation of country or city borders – or time – through Huuva’s locations around Europe. The future of restaurants will be driven through platforms like Huuva,” Leppälä said. Huuva offers end-to-end services, such as their proprietary technology, for restaurants joining its kitchen cohorts, making it possible for them to expand in days instead of months. Huuva is currently planning on opening its first kitchen location in Central Europe. Adam Valkin, Managing Director at General Catalyst says; “Since their launch in September 2021, Huuva has made impressive progress. Their unique approach in Europe has significantly improved the food selection for the end customer in a number of neighborhoods while making food delivery more profitable for restaurants. At the same time, couriers get to pick up from delivery optimized locations minimizing delivery times.” Timo Ahopelto, Founding Partner at Lifeline Ventures says; “Huuva is a prime showcase of an ambitious, fast-moving startup with a distinctive offering in an exciting new market.

As such, organizations need help to identify threats and bring clarity to their logging and analytics to provide complete visibility over risks on-premise and in the cloud environments so they can take immediate action. That’s where Devo comes in. Devo is a Boston-basedcloud-native logging and security analytics provider that helps organizations dig deep into their data from apps, networks, operations, security, IoT, and machines, and defend them against the ever-expanding threat landscape Today,Devo announced today it has raised $100 million in Series F funding at a valuation of $2 billionto fuel global expansion and acquisitions, andaccelerate its vision of the “autonomous SOC.” The round was led byEurazeo, a leading global investment firm with over $30 billion in assets under management. Other existing investors including Insight Partners, Georgian, TCV, General Atlantic, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Kibo Ventures also participated. The funding round comes on the heels of Devo’s acquisition of the AI-powered threat hunting tech startup Kognos.Devo acquired Kognos back in April to build and deliver the next-generation of autonomous security operation center (SOC). If you were to assess the technology trends that shaped our world over the past decade, the advent of self-driving vehicles, (also known as autonomous vehicles) would likely stand out as one of the most promising technologies with the potential to reshape our societies in many years to come. While the concept of autonomous vehicles continues to gain ground, the application of autonomous systems is also beginning to take root in the domain of cybersecurity. And that’s where Devo comes in. With the acquisition of Konos,Devo is now able to deliverautonomous SOC— that includes complete visibility, automation, analytics, and open access to community expertise and content.The autonomous SOC automates key aspects of the threat lifecycle – detection, triage, investigation, and hunting, eliminating the repetitive manual tasks. Pedro Castillo founded Devo (then Logtrust) in 2011 after nearly 20 years of working as technical security director/CTO at Bankinter and founder of a security software start-up. The startup rebranded fromLogtrust to Devo in 2018. Unlike other cloud-logging tools on the market, the Devo platform provides organizations with a cloud-native logging and security analytics solution that integrates with a set of purpose-built applications for security, IT operations, and machine learning use cases. Commenting on the funding, Devo CEOMarc van Zadelhoff said:“Security teams are facing more threats than ever—regardless of industry or geography—and that challenge is compounded by the difficulty of hiring and retaining talent, a lack of visibility into the full attack surface, and the speed and scale necessary to keep up with not just growing threats, but the growth of their organizations.” Zadelhoff added, “This round of funding allows us to deliver on the autonomous SOC through continued innovation of our technology, expand to more regions to serve more customers, and consider more M&A opportunities. We’re thrilled to have instilled such confidence in our investors that they continue to support our innovation and the value we deliver to customers.” Devo plans to continue to drive expansion in new verticals and geographies, particularly the public sector and the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. In February, Devoannouncedit was designated as the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program’s (FedRAMP) “In-Process” and expects to reach full authorization in the fall of 2022. Headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with operations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, Devo is backed by Insight Partners, Georgian, TCV, General Atlantic, Bessemer Venture Partners, Kibo Ventures and Eurazeo"

In a Thursday blog post, the company told staff of plans to slash the employee count due to what it refers to as “crypto winter.”The twin brothers said the industry is in a “contraction phase” known as “crypto winter,” which has been “further compounded by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil.” Geminiwas founded in 2015, by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, to build a bridge to the future of money. Its goal is to build a world-class digital asset exchange and custodian based in the United States.Gemini dubs itself a next-generation cryptocurrency exchange anda platform for buying, selling, storing, and earning cryptocurrencies including bitcoin and ether, and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) tokens. Gemini alsoallows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets. Gemini provides a simple and secure platform for crypto investors to build their crypto portfolios.The startup also runs a non-fungible token or NFT marketplace for digital art and collectibles which has 375 unique artist collaborations. According to a story in the New York Times, the Winklevoss brothers bought $11 million worth of Bitcoins in 2013. They soon became crypto evangelists, which led to the creation of the crypto exchange Gemini. Each of the twins is reportedly worth $1.4 billion apiece, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Winklevoss twins are best known for their feud with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over whether he stole the idea for the social networking website from them. The twin brothers are also known for co-founding HarvardConnection (later renamed ConnectU) along with Harvard classmate Divya Narendra. In 2004, theWinklevoss brothers sued Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, claiming he stole their ConnectU idea to create the popular social networking site Facebook. Below is the full message. “The following message was shared with Gemini employees this morning. Fellow Astronauts — we are writing to update you on a difficult decision that will impact a number of you and the overall size of our team. But first, we want to start by reiterating what we’ve said many times before and can’t be said enough — our people are our greatest asset. Without you, Gemini simply wouldn’t be here today. Your hard work and dedication has propelled Gemini to heights that would have been hard to imagine when we first started building eight years ago, in the Fall of 2014. You shape our culture, drive our innovation, and breathe life and energy into our products that have brought greater choice, independence, and opportunity to millions of people around the world. The crypto revolution is well underway and its impact will continue to be profound. But its trajectory has been anything but gradual or predictable. Its path can best be described as punctuated equilibrium — periods of equilibrium or stasis that are punctuated by dramatic moments of hypergrowth, followed by sharp contractions that settle down to a new equilibrium that is higher than the one before. This is where we are now, in the contraction phase that is settling into a period of stasis — what our industry refers to as “crypto winter.” This has all been further compounded by the current macroeconomic and geopolitical turmoil. We are not alone. To that end, we have asked team leaders to ensure that they are focused only on products that are critical to our mission and assess whether their teams are right-sized for the current, turbulent market conditions that are likely to persist for some time. After much thought and consideration, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to part ways with approximately 10% of our workforce. Next Steps Impacted Astronauts will receive a calendar invite today for an individual conversation to provide information on the separation package and healthcare benefits we are providing. We have closed all of our physical offices today so that these conversations will be held remotely to protect the privacy of each impacted individual. Our highest priority throughout will be to treat everyone affected with compassion and respect. Looking Ahead Tomorrow, we will hold a company-wide standup with all remaining Astronauts to talk about the future ahead. Today is a tough day, but one that will make Gemini better over the long run. Constraint is the mother of innovation and difficult times are a forcing function for focus, which is critical to the success of any startup. Every great company throughout history has faced similar challenges along the way and Gemini is no different. And as painful as this moment is, we ultimately see it as an opportunity to double-down on our strongest ideas and customer-centric products so that we may be the catalyst of innovation coming out of these leaner times that will help fuel the next cycle of crypto growth and adoption. We have never had more conviction in our people, our products, and our mission — to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom for our customers. Amazing awaits. Onward and Upward, Cameron + Tyler”"
2022.6.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/02/javelins-weapons-supplied-us-nato-ukraine-now-listed-sale-darknet/,"Late last month, the United Senate overwhelmingly approved a $40 billion emergency military and humanitarian aid package for Ukraine as part of the effort to support the country in its ongoing war with Russia. The war, which is in its fourth month, has displaced millions of Ukrainians and thousands of civilian deaths. However, this is not the first time the United States and its NATO allies have sent weapons to Ukraine.In January, the US sent a shipment of 300 Javelin anti-tank missile systems in military aidto Ukraine. But as we reported back in February, a large number of the weapons ended up in Russian hands. Interfaxreportedthat Russian troops conducting a special operation in Ukraine have seized a large number of weapons recently supplied by Western countries, including U.S. Javelin Missile Systems and British NLAW missile. However, as western countries ramped up weapons and ammunition shipments to Ukraine, arms trade experts have warned that some of the lethal assistance given to Ukrainian forces could end up falling into the wrong hands. It now appears their worst fear has been confirmed. Today,ASB Military News reportedthat some of these weapons have now made their way to the dark web, the part of the web that can only be assessed using the TOR browser.According to a report,the Ukrainian Armed Forces are now selling Javelins, military equipment, and other weapons supplied by the US and its NATO allies on the darknet to buyers in the Middle East and North Africa. “Ukrops are selling Javelins on the darknet.The command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine resells equipment and weapons supplied by NATO to the Middle East and North Africa,” ASB Military News wrote. According to the report,anyone with a TOR browser can buy the ATGM Javeline in the online store. Below are some of the equipment listed for sale on the Darknet.  The US-made javelins anti-tank are manufactured by US Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. Each Javelin costs $178,000, including the launch system and missile, according to the Pentagon’s 2021 budget. However, these Javelins are now listed for sale on the darknet for just $30,000."

With the ongoing macro events, inflation, and global economic downturn, technology startups are finding it increasingly difficult to raise new funds. But that has not affected the cybersecurity space. Amidunprecedented cybersecurity threats, investors and VC firms are pouring millions of dollars into cybersecurity startups. Today, Laminar Security, an Israel-based cloud startup that provides data leakage protection in the public cloud, announced it hasraised an additional $30 million in extended Series A funding, nearly doubling its funding to $67 million in less than six months amid rising demand for its solutions. Laminar will use the new cash infusion tofund faster product innovation, grow sales and marketing to capture the market demand, and for the buildout of its global team. The additional funding, which was backed by Tiger Global Management and Salesforce Ventures, follows seed and initial Series A investments of $37 million in November 2021. The funding comes at a pivotal time for Laminar as it continues its first-to-market product rollout with the announcement of three new capabilities within the Laminar Cloud Data Security Platform – giving the company a significant lead in the public cloud data security startup race. The backing from Tiger Global Management is a sign of the firm’s confidence in the company’s direction. Tiger Global has a great track record of spotting the next big names in cybersecurity, including SentinelOne, Snyk, and Lacework. Salesforce Ventures is a major cloud data and cybersecurity investor with a mission to bring trust to the cloud industry with strategic investments in companies like Wiz, Databricks, and Snowflake. Founded in 2020 by a brilliant team of Israeli red team experts,Laminar is led by co-founders and CEO Amit Shaked and Oran Avraham.Laminar makes it possible for data protection teams to reduce the attack surface, detect real-time data leaks and get back in control of their data. Laminar claims to be thefirst cloud data security platform for everything you build and run in AWS, Azure, GCP, Snowflake, and Databricks. The startup also provides complete and comprehensive data observability for everything running in your public cloud accounts. Both agentless and asynchronous monitoring of datastores, compute as well as data egress channels allow sanctioned data movements and alerts when something’s wrong. Since emerging from stealth last fall, Laminar has seen significant demand from CISOs and their security teams for its cloud data security solutions, which in turn is driving investor excitement. Including Laminar’s $67 million of venture capital, the various cloud data security startups have now raised a combined more than $200 million in funding, validating the industry’s need for visibility into and security of public cloud data. “The growing number of players in our space is exciting as it drives us to further innovate with both speed and quality. A rising tide lifts all boats. Hence, the more cybersecurity and cloud leaders learn that there are products out there that solve their greatest public cloud data challenges, the more we all win,” said Amit Shaked, CEO and co-founder, Laminar. Nowi Kallen, managing director at Salesforce Ventures said, “Laminar is rapidly innovating to provide effective solutions for data security posture management and cloud DLP. We are thrilled to support the team on its mission to make the public cloud a significantly safer place for organizations’ data and are highly impressed with their pace of execution.”"
2022.6.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/02/65788/,"In April,we wrote about Acala after thedecentralized finance networkteamed up with Anchor, a savings and borrowing protocol built on the Terra blockchain, to grow the decentralized stablecoin space through a variety of integrations spanning the Terra and Polkadot ecosystems. Since its inception three years ago, Acala has built partnerships to further solidify DeFi ecosystems and grow the decentralized stablecoin market. Today, Acala, in collaboration with Manta, have successful completed the interoperability between Calamari and Karura. The collaboration between Acala’s stablecoin ($aUSD) and ($KAR) will enable crypto assets to move both privately and freely across ecosystems. Manta Network, the privacy hub for Web3, and Acala have announced the successful cross-chain transfer of parachain assets. The opening of a new HRMP channel and successful deployment of cross-consensus communication to bridge assets will enable privacy and interoperability across both parachains. The privatization of assets is a big step forward for the projects, the ecosystem development as well as privacy in general, as well as another step towards integrating across their respective Kurura and Calamari Networks. Calamari is the canary network of Manta Network, while Karura is the all-in-one DeFi hub of Kusama, which hosts its native asset, a multi-collateralized stablecoin backed by cross-chain assets ($aUSD). Kenny Li emphasizes the importance of this partnership, “Collaborating with Acala marks a major milestone for Manta, and the broader Kusama ecosystem. With privacy being paramount to the future development of web3, it’s humbling to be a part of technological successes along the way. Interoperability has always been the name of the game, and this is a big step forward.” Now crypto assets including Acala’s stablecoin ($aUSD) and ($KAR) can move privately and freely across ecosystems.” Following the launch of the XCM integration between Calamari and Karura, Calamari will continue to integrate and bridge additional parachain assets for privatization from throughout the Kusama ecosystem. Calamari’s native token, $KMA, will also exist on Karura to access additional functionality through various projects launched on Karura. Calamari XCM integration with Karura will bridge assets across both parachains in production environments. Calamari Network’s parachain asset ($KMA) will interact within the Karura ecosystem, accessing various DeFi products for staking, lending and other use cases. Native asset transfers from Karura to Calamari Network can be privatized and transferred in a shielded manner from peer to peer. In March 2022 Acala and Manta Network and seven other Polkadot parachain teams announced the creation of a $250 million aUSD Ecosystem Fund to support early-stage startups building applications with strong stablecoin use cases on any Polkadot or Kusama parachain. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has been gaining a lot of momentum in recent years. DeFi started with a very simple goal ofallowing people, merchants, and businesses without intermediaries like banks. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeFiaims todemocratize finance by replacing legacy and centralized banking and financial institutions with peer-to-peer relationships. In just four years later, DeFi has grown into a bigger ecosystem that includes decentralized exchanges (DEXs), decentralized financial services like lending, borrowing, staking, stablecoins, and many more. One of the leading startups powering this ecosystem isAcala, a decentralized finance network powering the aUSD ecosystem. Acala Network is built to host an array of financial applications that make use of smart contract technology, interoperable cross-chain functionality, and robust security protocols. Acala’s core product, Acala USD, is a decentralized, multi-collateral, crypto-backed stablecoin serving as the native stablecoin of the Polkadot ecosystem. About Acala Acala is a decentralized finance network powering the aUSD ecosystem. The core product, Acala USD, is a decentralized, multi-collateral, crypto-backed stablecoin serving as the native stablecoin of the Polkadot ecosystem.

2022.6.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/02/balancer-answer-layer-2s-searching/,"As a peer-to-peer distributed digital ledger, blockchain has become a revolutionary technology that has permeated every facet of our lives. However, blockchain is not without its own set of challenges.One of the biggest issues right now is the lack of interconnectivity between different blockchains. For instance, you cannot connect with someone on Ethereum if you’re on Bitcoin.Layer 2 has taken a toll on blockchain interconnectivity. That’s why two blockchain companies are joining forces to address this problem. Today,Balancer Protocolannounced it has launched on leading Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution Optimism to significantly reduce gas costs and scale DeFi liquidity. Ethereum’s challenges have led to prohibitive fees, creating an extreme barrier to entry for users of decentralized finance. Balancer’s technology launching on Optimism ensures DeFi liquidity provision with the scope for sustainable, scalable, innovative growth that is highly competitive in the L2 network. “By launching on Optimism, Balancer is recognizing that it is a leading L2 solution. Its distinctive scalability, while inheriting Ethereum’s security, led to the recognition that it will enhance the user experience and propel growth. L2s show the promise of reducing transaction fees and network congestion, and we are excited to bring our technology to the Optimism ecosystem.” – Fernando Martinelli, Balancer Labs CEO & Co-Founder. The front end of the Optimism deployment will be led by Balancer’s collaboration with Beethoven X. The cumulative expertise from both teams results in a DEX with the technical prowess and innovative capabilities needed to become a formidable player in the Optimism ecosystem. Optimism supports all DApps in the Ethereum network by using a technique known as optimistic rollups. Optimistic rollups assume all transactions in the rollup are valid, thereby increasing Ethereum’s transactions per second and drastically decreasing fees – securing over $600 million in on-chain value. Exceedingly expensive transaction fees, growing network congestion, and an inability to scale significantly stifle the growth of the $600 billion Ethereum network. Currently, Ethereum can only support around 30 transactions per second, resulting in the aforementioned issues. “We are incredibly excited to see Balancer going live on Optimism. Balancer is an important DeFi building block and seeks to bring a more flexible trading experience to the ecosystem. Moreover, working with the excellent Balancer and BeethovenX teams represents an awesome chance to learn from decentralized governance ‘in the wild’–a journey that we recently began ourselves.” – Ben Jones – Chief Scientist at Optimism Foundation. Balancer’s technological capabilities to slash gas costs, super-charge capital efficiency, and unlock arbitrage with zero-token starting capital paired with Optimism’s scaling solutions will help answer the demands of the fast-evolving DeFi environment. About Balancer Protocol Balancer is a community-driven protocol, automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor that empowers decentralized exchange and the automated portfolio management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM compatible systems. About Beethoven X Inspired by the work at BalancerLabs and built on the Balancer V2 technology, Beethoven X is a community-driven DEX and DeFi powerhouse on the Fantom network. Beethoven X has taken the foundations laid down by Balancer and iterated on this powerful technology to become one of the leading Decentralised Exchanges on the Fantom ecosystem. About Optimism Optimism is a leading open-source Layer 2 scalability solution for the Ethereum network. Backed by top venture capital funds such as Paradigm and a16z for a total valuation of over $1.6 billion, the solution offers users lower gas fees and higher throughput compared to the Ethereum mainnet. With an estimated on-chain value of $600 million, Optimism is the third-largest Ethereum Layer 2 by TVL."
2022.6.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/02/elon-musk-shares-views-remote-work-second-email-said/,"Yesterday, Elon Muskasked all Tesla employees to come back to the office or lose their jobs.In a leaked email shared on social media, Musk told workers at SpaceX and Tesla to spend a minimum of 40 hours a week in the office or be terminated. Just like other companies, Tesla and SpaceX have allowed their employees to work remotely due to the covid-19 pandemic. As the pandemic subsides,these companies are now reevaluating their remote working policies. In an email sent on Tuesday titled “Remote work is no longer acceptable,” which wasposted by two pro-Tesla Twitter accountsand which Musk appeared to confirm, Musk said that “anyone who wishes to do remote work” must be in the office for a minimum of 40 hours a week. Musk added that in only extreme cases where this was deemed impossible would he personally decide whether to reconsider his decree.Musk asked all employees to come back to the office or lose their jobs: Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers. Today, we just learned there is a second email whereMusk reminded employees that he set the example by sleeping in the factory. Musk reminded Tesla employees that the company would have gone bankrupt if he had not stayed in the factory and worked alongside others.  “The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” Mr. Musk said. “That is why I spent so much time in the factory — so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, SpaceX would long ago have gone bankrupt.” Here are the emails in full: First email: Subject: Remote work is no longer acceptble Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla. This is less than we ask of factory workers. If there are particularly exceptional contributors for whom this is impossible, I will review and approve those exceptions directly. Moreover, the “office” must be a main Tesla office, not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties, for example being responsible for Fremont factory human relations, but having your office be in another state. Thanks, Elon Second email: Subject: To be super clear Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week. Moreover, the office must be where your actual colleagues are located, not some remote pseudo office. If you don’t show up, we will assume you have resigned. The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence. That is why I lived in the factory so much – so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt. There are of course companies that don’t require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It’s been a while. Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in. Thanks, Elon"
2022.6.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/02/bitcoin-com-head-engineering-hopes-help-users-build-crypto-origin-story-verse-token-launch/,"It is paramount to help people explore the opportunities found within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Bitcoin.com team introduced the VERSE token as an incentive and reward for people willing to educate themselves on these matters. More importantly, the token will guide users on their ongoing crypto journey, as it offers strong utility. Most people will remember vividly how they were first introduced to cryptocurrency. It may have been through a colleague t work, an advertisement, reading a news piece, Bitcoin Pizza Day, etc. Creating that origin story is the exciting beginning of a long journey to understand how cryptocurrencies work, which options are available, and how things will unfold over time. However, many people venture out on their own to learn more about Bitcoin and crypto and get a bit confused. As most people have no idea what they are doing or what half of the jargon means, there needs to be a better-guided solution. Striking a balance between education and wonder is essential. In the past, most people would simply buy a cryptocurrency and then expand into other verticals across the broader industry. Bitcoin.com Director of Engineering Andrei Terentiev adds: “So one of the things we see is how I described my crypto origin story. I think we actually see a lot of users kind of take a similar route, right? So they might be coming into the space and being like, “Okay, I have no idea what I’m doing.” And then their first experience is probably, I don’t know, buying crypto with credit card or something like that, and then gradually they expand into a lot of things where it’s like, “Oh, now I can do this,” I don’t know, “Yield farming, or I can do the staking, or I can do all this training and stuff.” And I think that is kind of what we’re picturing as like they’re introducing themselves and getting involved in like the crypto-verse.”  The introduction of the VERSE token is a mechanism to make that crypto origin more appealing to onlookers. It is a reward and utility token for those willing to explore the cryptocurrency ecosystem with the help of Bitcoin.com. The Bitcoin.com platform provides various cryptocurrency-related services users may take an interest in, including decentralized trading, staking, educational efforts, news, etc. VERSE will serve as the ultimate reward and utility token users can earn by buying, selling, spending, swapping, investing, and staying informed about crypto. All users who participate in and contribute to the Bitcoin.com ecosystem can earn rewards. Additionally, the token is similar to CRO and BNB, although it borrows elements from centralized finance tokens like NEXO and decentralized protocol assets like Uniswap’s UNI. Using and earning the VERSE token is possible through various means: Bitcoin.com Head of Financial Services Corbin Fraser states: “If you’re brand new, it’s a reward token where you can basically be incentivized to do stuff across the Bitcoin.com platform. If you’re someone who’s a little bit more knowledgeable and, like Andrei was saying, who’s like a little further down that journey, you’re starting to like look for things that you can do with your crypto, perhaps earn some yield on it and actually like get some nice little passive income through like yield farming and you can lock up some tokens, and crypto, and stable coins and basically earn yield through the liquidity pools on our decks, you can stake those LPs and earn additional Verse.” Combining the strong utility of this token with a sustainable reward distribution scheme makes VERSE a powerful asset for crypto novices. For instance, one could help spread the word about this project by acquiring Bitcoin.com and Verse merchandise paid for in VERSE. Additionally, one can unlock a [premium] payment card by holding VERSE and earn cashback in the token to unlock utility and rewards continually. There is much to learn about the cryptocurrency industry. It may seem a bit daunting at first, but the Bitcoin.com ecosystem provides a compelling overview of everything through its application, website, and services in the broader ecosystem. Users will find everything they need and begin earning rewards from day one, making it an enjoyable journey for newcomers. Moreover, they will gradually learn to explore new features and solutions powered by the VERSE token. Anyone can begin their crypto journey without prior knowledge or owning any cryptocurrency. A whole new world awaits and your crypto origin story is just a few clicks away."

Similarly, the number of Internet-connected devices grew to 22 billion at the end of 2018.According to Statista, the number of internet of things (IoT) connected devices worldwide is estimated to reach 38.6 billion by 2025. However, these numbers didn’t includenon-human internet automated programs popularly known as bots.According to the most recent security report from Barracuda, the human race is a minority on the internet. The report found that humans make up less than 40 percent of the internet’s traffic. The Barracuda report reveals that automated traffic including bots and hacking tools takes up 64% of internet traffic. Of the 64%, 39% of all traffic was from bad bots while just 25% of automated traffic was made up of good bots, such as search engine crawlers and social network bots. Humans represent 36% of all internet traffic.    That’s not all.The report also included a breakdown of bad bot traffic by sources and location. The report further showed that North America accounts for 67% of bad bot traffic, followed by Europe (22%) and then Asia (7.5%).  Commenting on the report,Nitzan Miron, VP of Product Management, Application Security, Barracuda said: “While some bots like search engine crawlers are good, our research shows that over 60% of bots are dedicated to carrying out malicious activities at scale. When left unchecked, these bad bots can steal data, affect site performance, and even lead to a breach. That’s why it’s critically important to detect and effectively block bot traffic.” Other studies have come out with similar findings. In a Twitter post yesterday, the World of Statistics, said that “humans now only make up 38.5% of internet traffic – The other 61.5% is non-human (bots, hacking tools, etc.)” The eye-opening number caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Surprised and shocked by the number, Musk responded with a double exclamation. !! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2022  In another study conducted byProfessor Simon Hegelich, in Munich, he found that many social media accountscan post thousands of comments a day, every day, as well as send messages and links.ProfessorHegelich added that these robots act like humans, making it impossible for the ordinary online user to tell the difference."
2022.6.3,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/03/elon-musk-warns-major-layoffs-tesla-plans-cut-10-tesla-workforce/,"The ripple effect of the global economic downturn has spread to the tech sector. Dozens of tech companies have either cut jobs or planning to let their employees go due to the ongoing macro events including inflation and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. However, some tech companies pointed to overhiring during periods of rapid growth as the reason for the recent layoffs. Yesterday, Gemini, a crypto startup founded by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce, making it the first U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange and custodian company to suffer the crypto slump casualty. Today,Tesla Elon Musk said he plans to cut 10% of the company’s jobs due to a “super bad feeling” he has about the economy, Reuters reported on Friday, citing Musk’s email to executives titled “pause all hiring worldwide.” The ‘bad feeling’ Musk has about the economy may have to do with his earlier warnings of an imminent recession. Just this week, Musk tweeted that “recessions serve a vital economic cleansing function,” in response to a tweet from Australian tech billionaire Scott Farquhar, who criticized Musk’s call for staff to return to the office and suggested that Tesla employees should look into remote work positions elsewhere. The above set of tweets illustrate why recessions serve a vital economic cleansing function — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 2, 2022  Meanwhile, Tesla has not yet commented on the layoff plan, but the email came two days after Musk issued a warning to his employees, saying they should spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week or leave the company, as manufacturing is “the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth… will not happen by phoning it in.” According to its annual SEC filing,Tesla employed around 100,000 people at the end of 2021. That means about 10,000 will be affected by the planned layoff. Tesla is not alone. There are at least fifty companies that have either laid off their employees or plan to in the near future.Below is a list of 2022 U.S. tech layoffs courtesy of CrunchBase."
2022.6.4,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.6.4,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol. Founded in 2020 byDavid Joao Vieira Carvaho, and Monica Oravcova,Naoris Protocol is the Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh for the hyper-connected world.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.6.4,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate. Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022  Another analysis conducted by Israeli cybersecurity company CHEQ back in May found that12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.“Up to 12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.”CHEQ found that11.71% of all website visits originating from Twitter were by bots or fake users. On April 25, Twitter agreed to sell the company to Elon Musk for $44 billion.Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive$54.20in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing the proposed transaction.

2022.6.5,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/05/metaverse-will-change-cryptocurrency/,"The popularity of the Metaverse has taken the internet by storm since Facebook changed its name to Meta in October 2021. The talk about the metaverse is slowly making its way into everyday conversations in the boardrooms, on the web, in mainstream media, andin pop culture. The metaverse could be worth $13 trillion by 2030, according to a report from Citi. Although still in a nascent stage, the metaverse can be described as a digital world where the real and virtual worlds converge into a vision of science fiction. You can also think of the metaverse as a virtual world where millions of people could gather to work, play, and socialize in immersive virtual environments and communicate across shared spaces across different platforms. From gaming to medicine, the metaverse has the potential to transform our ways of life. Some of the best metaverse applications are in areas such aseducation, gaming, medicine, finance, and immersive learning. As the metaverse evolves, we also see how creators and writers are using technology to share their creations and artwork. Metaverse is the immersive virtual world you can experience through your computer or virtual reality headset. You might think of it as glorified gaming in which your avatar interacts with other avatars, fighting battles in games pioneered by Call of Duty, constructing buildings and landscapes a la Minecraft, or doing both in the classic Fortnite. But now Facebook’s new “Meta” identity, and its massive investment in the consumer-ready Oculus VR headset, focuses all our attention on a technology that both tech enthusiasts and corporate giants believe can fundamentally change our lives. These players don’t consider the metaverse as a subset of the internet, but as a successor. Once you have opened the door to other realities, there’s an infinite number of possibilities to experience as you migrate the real-to-virtual continuum, from the real world to a 2D camera perspective to a 3D interactive space. As we speak, Microsoft and Meta Platforms are partnering to create virtual workspaces, meeting rooms, and social networks. Roblox and Epic Games are hosting live and on-demand rock star concerts and virtual corporate events. Visionaries predict that everyone could experience walking on the moon or attending the Super Bowl. Shopping, schooling, training, architecture, healthcare, and social media will all be transformed. As seismic as this will be, there are other forces joining the metaverse that promise to magnify its impact: blockchain and cryptocurrency. Naturally, every world needs an economy and digital currency almost seems created for just this purpose. But what will this convergence mean for those of us that are used to living in the real world? Alex Lemberg can tell us. He’s the CEO of a fintech companyNimbus Platform. Alex brings over 27 years of experience on Wall Street and is a thought leader in this burgeoning field. “The opportunities are tremendous for everyone, spanning the physical and virtual worlds and all modes of VR, from non-immersive, to augmented, to fully immersive technologies. The integration of blockchain will significantly benefit both the development of the metaverse and adoption of crypto as our currency of choice.” The fully functioning economies of virtual worlds are expanding rapidly and require intrinsic, autonomous digital currencies. Lemberg points to amplified gamer spending within the virtual sphere, like the NFT estate in Decentraland bought for $2.5 million, to illustrate the potential in monetizing AR and VR gaming. NFT avatars projects alone generate enormous value, with recent Cryptopunks selling for 7-12 million – BTC and EFT, of course. “It’s intuitive and practical to utilize crypto for purchasing in these digital realms because blockchain is ideal for managing sales,” Lemberg continues. “Crypto wallets improve user experience and level of trust, and blockchain addresses broader concerns about privacy and security.” These advantages are confirmed as platforms like Decentraland and Sandbox issue their own tokens. In these realms, gamers can create their own businesses to monetize themselves. For example in Decentraland, in a user-created casino gamblers, wagers, and dealers are paid in the token MANA. It’s fairly easy to see how these virtual assets transfer into real-world value as demand grows. Lemberg sees broader AR and VR use cases utilizing existing gaming platform technology because it has already been developed. This translates into an expansion of the currency adopted by the platforms. “In the future, both physical and virtual NFT products and services will be advertised and acquired via interrelated markets utilizing cryptocurrency as the standardized legal tender of the whole metaverse.” Ecommerce, he forecasts, will grow exponentially as shoppers are able to rotate and visualize products in their homes or walk through virtual malls. Advertising will be radically altered when users can evaluate products by interacting in their own or virtual settings. Retailers are now acquiring virtual storefronts as other entrepreneurs carve up the rest of the digital landscape. Virtual entertainment will dominate by immersing concertgoers and sports fans in venues that have never been accessible to everyone. Lemberg adds, “this doesn’t even begin to address B2B use cases such as training, architecture, and manufacturing.” Blockchain and cryptocurrencies also have wider implications, Lemberg offers. With these technologies, the metaverse provides autonomy, security, and high-speed transaction, but it will also dramatically increase the activities available and participation of populations that were traditionally denied access to them. Furthermore, blockchain and cryptocurrencies have the potential to decentralize platform ownership while providing peer-to-peer exchange. “Who will own the metaverse?” Lemberg asks. Of course, it’s now in the hands of mega-corporations that have the resources to develop the necessary interactive hardware and internet broadband, as well as the platforms themselves. But Lemberg concludes, “The inherent decentralized autonomous structure of blockchain and crypto makes it possible for user-generated content and distributed control of metaverse assets and future enterprises.” That’s a vision of a future we can all welcome."

As you probably learned back then, a star system is a group of planets, meteors, or other objects that orbit a large star. However, many people sometimes confuse the star system with the solar system. While there are many star systems out there in the universe, including at least 200 billion other stars in our Milky Way galaxy,there is only one solar system. This is simply because our sun is known by its Latin name, Sol. The solar system consists of anything that orbits the sun or orbits the planets which orbit the sun. For instance, the moon of the earth is part of our solar system. A galaxy, on the other hand, is a huge collection of stars that are held together by gravitational attraction. When you go out at night, all the stars you see in the night sky are in our own Milky Way Galaxy. Although there are a dozen minornearest galaxies closer to our Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy is the closest large spiral galaxy to ours.At approximately 2.5 million light-years away, the Andromeda galaxy, (also called M31) is our Milky Way’s largest galactic neighbor. Although far away from our galaxy,the Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at nearly a quarter-million miles per hour. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists have developed a simulation of the head-on collision of our Milky Way galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy.Based on the simulation, scientists estimated that it will take 4 billion years in the future before the two galaxies collide.As scary as it may sound, the process of galaxy collisionplays an important role in theevolution of the universe. In 2012,NASA astronomers announced they could now “predict with certainty the next major cosmic event to affect our galaxy, sun, and solar system: the titanic collision of our Milky Way galaxy with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy.” According to the report, NASA said that the“Milky Way is destined to get a major makeover during the encounter, which is predicted to happen four billion years from now.” The collision will cause the sun to be flung into a new region of our galaxy, “but our Earth and solar system are in no danger of being destroyed,” NASA explained. Fast forward a decade later. NASA announced today that the Milky Way will collide with Andromeda Galaxy much sooner than expected. As part of its explanation for its daily “Astronomy Picture of the Day,” NASA said that it’s most likely thatour Milky Way Galaxy will one day collide with its larger neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy. Here is how NASA explains it: “Careful plotting of slight displacements of M31’s stars relative to background galaxies on recent Hubble Space Telescope images indicate that the center of M31 could be on a direct collision course with the center of our home galaxy. Still, the errors in sideways velocity appear sufficiently large to admit a good chance that the central parts of the two galaxies will miss, slightly, but will become close enough for their outer halos to become gravitationally entangled.”  NASA goes on to say that “Once that happens, the two galaxies will become bound, dance around, and eventually merge to become one large elliptical galaxy — over the next few billion years. Pictured here is a combination of images depicting the sky of a world (Earth?) in the distant future when the outer parts of each galaxy begin to collide. The exact future of our Milky Way and the entire surrounding Local Group of Galaxies is likely to remain an active topic of research for years to come.” “After nearly a century of speculation about the future destiny of Andromeda and our Milky Way, we, at last, have a clear picture of how events will unfold over the coming billions of years,” said Sangmo Tony Sohn of STScI. “The scenario is like a baseball batter watching an oncoming fastball. Although Andromeda is approaching us more than 2,000 times faster, it will take 4 billion years before the strike,” NASA said. Below is the video of how the collision will play out.  Below is the NASA video."

The funding caps off a major comeback for co-founders Neal and Jeffrey Harmon, who led Angel Studios to over $100 million in annual revenue just one year after Disney and Warner Bros. tried to shut the studio down in court. In 2017, VidAngel, a streaming service similar to Netflix co-founded by Harmon with his brother Jeffery, filedfor bankruptcy. VidAngel provided a filtering service that helps families cut out negative language, sex, and violence from movies and shows. What sets Angel Studios apart from others is that it empowers its audience to decide what content gets produced and distributed, while creating communities around each project. Here is how Angel Studios works: creators submit project ideas on the Angel platform, and “Angel investors” fund the ones they’re most interested in seeing. Its audience decides what content gets produced and distributed while creating communities around each project.After it’s produced, content is delivered directly to viewers and grows in popularity as fans share it with others. Stephen Oskoui, Managing Partner of Gigafund explains:“Angel Studios helps creators build a direct relationship with their fans and produce meaningful and compelling content for hundreds of millions of people who have been underserved by the entertainment industry.” Meanwhile,The Chosen, the first-ever multi-season TV show about the life of Jesus, was one of the company’s first projects which earned hundreds of millions of views around the world. In a statement,Neal Harmon, co-founder of Angel Studios said:“People get to participate in culture. They get to have an impact on culture and it’s not just a bunch of Hollywood executives that make these decisions. It is the smartest executives of all time — it’s the audience.” Founded byNeal and Jeffrey Harmon,Angel Studios’ crowdfunded studio platform serves audiences that have been overlooked by Hollywood and other media conglomerates. At Angel Studios, “Angel” investors choose which titles will be created, funded, and distributed."

Today,London-based cybersecurity tech startup CybSafe announced it has raised $28 million in Series B fundingto transform security awareness and human cyber risk management usinguse behavioral science and data science. The round, which bring the company’s total funding to $40 million, was led by Evolution Equity Partners, with participation from Emerald Development Managers and existing investors IQ Capital and Hannover Digital Investments (HDI) GmbH. Founded in 2020 by CEO Oz Alashe and Sean Lumley,CybSafe helps organizations manage human cyber risk and prevent security incidents by understanding theweakest link in your cybersecurity chain.Unlike traditional cybesecurity solutions on the market, the CybSafe software platform tracks and measures security behavior to improve security controls and awareness activities. Through its platform,CybSafe delivers instant, personalized support for users and enables security teams to reduce risk in changing environments. CybSafe software is currently being used by over 350 organizations, in 15 countries and is accredited by NCSC and CIISec. The investment is a result of CybSafe’s continued innovation and pioneering approach to managing human cybersecurity risk. Since its Series A, CybSafe has experienced significant customer growth, adding key enterprise accounts to its impressive roster of customers, now including Credit Suisse, Barclays Bank, HSBC, FNZ Group and Moody’s. Additionally, CybSafe has also been on a mission to bolster its team. Its new Chief Marketing Officer, Munyaradzi Hoto, recently joined the team to drive growth and international expansion. It also follows CybSafe’s recognition as a global market leader by independent market analysis firm, Forrester. According to the Forrester Wave Report, CybSafe is disrupting with its data-driven approach to managing human risk and is recognized as having “pioneered a new approach to SA&T (security awareness and training) that uses data and metrics to change behavior and instill a security culture.” According to CybSafe’s ICO analysis, an estimated 80 percent of data breaches in 2021 were caused by human error. Companies need to tackle behavior to develop a security-first culture. Yet, most security teams still can’t quickly assess the impact their security controls have on user behavior or the associated cyber risk. CybSafe will use the Series B investment to further its mission to support its customers in changing human behavior and lowering cybersecurity risk with behavioral and data science, ultimately preventing security incidents. In addition, to accelerate its product development, it will expand its team, across all roles including cybersecurity specialists, behavioral scientists, data scientists, and software engineers. It will also focus on go-to-market activities expanding into new geographies, including the US market. Oz Alashe MBE, former UK Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel and the CEO and founder of CybSafe, said: “Cybersecurity has always been a challenge. Keeping pace today is more complex than before. And not keeping pace has more severe consequences. This has not gone unnoticed. Cybersecurity is a top priority across many management boards, with businesses spending more time and money. Recent research from CybSafe and the National Cyber Security Alliance found that 1 in 3 people have been victims of a cyber breach. Furthermore, 1 in 5 have been victims more than once. For too long, cybersecurity training has forgotten people, lacked any scientific basis, and provided no data to evidence its effectiveness. We are here to revolutionize this by helping businesses reduce risk by positively influencing behaviors in a way that can be measured.” Karthik Subramanian, Partner at Evolution Equity Partners, said, “We invest in founders with disruptive cybersecurity offerings that are reimagining how businesses approach the increasing depth and breadth of cyber threats. CybSafe’s disruptive approach tackles a complex problem with a simple solution. They design their products with the user in mind, ensuring they are tackling the cause rather than simply treating the symptoms of cyber risk. CybSafe goes far beyond traditional compliance-driven approaches to security awareness, and instead focuses on delivering a genuine reduction in human cyber risk.”"
2022.6.6,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/06/iovlabs-launches-everyday-defi-initiative-rootstock-onboard-first-billion-users/,"In just four years since its inception,Decentralized finance (DeFi) has gone mainstream as millions of users andinvestors bypass the centralized traditional banks to trade directly with one another. Unlike the current legacy financial institutions, DeFi aims to facilitate transactions between individuals without the involvement of banks, governments, and financial institutions.Now, one tech startup is on a mission to accelerate further DeFi adoption with an initiative to onboard the first billion users. IOVlabs is a blockchain startup that develops the technologies needed for a new global financial ecosystem that fosters opportunity, transparency, and trust. The organization currently develops the RSK Smart Contract Network, RSK Infrastructure Framework (RIF), and Taringa!’s platforms.For years, IOVLabs has been pushing the boundaries of DeFi innovation and usability. Today, IOVlabs team announced they will soon unveil their “Everyday DeFi” initiative for the Rootstock ecosystem, spearheaded by the RIF Aggregation Layer-2 scaling solution based on zkSync. IOVLabs wants to make decentralized finance more accessible and usable for everyday users. That goal will be achieved through its “Everyday DeFi” initiative, to be unveiled during the Consensus 2022 conference in Austin, Texas. The new initiative will ultimately bring the first billion users to everyday decentralized finance. Through “Everyday DeFi”, IOVLabs aims to remove the barriers preventing everyday users from participating in decentralized finance. Moreover, the team acknowledges there are many people underserved by traditional finance, all of whom can benefit from a radically different approach to such products and services. Commenting on the launch, IOVLabs CEO and RSK Co-Founder Diego Zaldivar added,“Current DeFi solutions are too complex for regular users. That’s why it has only been used by an elite of advanced users. At IOVlabs, we created and continue to contribute to decentralized technologies like the Rootstock Blockchain and the RIF platform that enable Decentralized Finance to be easy to use and affordable. We are building a DeFi ecosystem for everybody, we are enabling Everyday DeFi.” IOVLabs has made significant strides in developing the Rootstock Blockchain and its broader ecosystem. Rootstock is the first platform to introduce smart contracts secured by the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, the team has introduced RIF services, a suite of decentralized tools to help builders establish Decentralized Sharing Economies. While these technologies are a solid addition, IOVLabs has its eye on a much bigger goal. Unlocking Everyday DeFi remains the ultimate objective, and the team will build and integrate new technologies. That process will enable fintech and Web3 innovators to build the first generation of Everyday DeFi applications on the RSK network.

Three months later,Thoma Bravo decided to cut the takeover offer by $1.1 billion to $9.6 billion. Today,Anaplan reported that Thoma Bravo had trimmed its takeover offer to $9.60 billion, after the software maker agreed to resolve a disagreement regarding compliance with certain merger terms, Reuters reported. In a statement, Anaplan said: “The Anaplan board agreed, after extensive consideration, to revise the merger agreement to avoid the risk of lengthy litigation over the disagreement.” Instead of the original $66 per share, Anaplan shareholders will now receive $63.75 per share. The offer price is still at a premium of 26% to Anaplan’s closing price before the deal was announced in March. The closing date remains unchanged. The deal is expected to close by June 30. Founded in 2006in a barn in Yorkshire, England, by Guy Haddleton, Sue Haddleton, and Michael Gould,Anaplan provides a connected planning platform that helps businesses and organizations make better-informed plans and decisions faster.Anaplanboasts over 1,900 customers and is viewed as a competitor to the likes of SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft. Frank Calderoni, chairman and CEO of Anaplan, said in astatementthat the takeover marks the start of a new chapter for the company.“We are confident that Thoma Bravo’s resources and insights will help us accelerate and scale our growth strategy,” he said. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022 providing there are no objections from regulators or Anaplan’s stockholders. Goldman Sachs and Qatalyst Partners are acting as financial advisors. “We are thrilled to partner with Thoma Bravo to build on the strength of our innovative platform and capitalize on the massive opportunity and incredible demand we are seeing,” said Frank Calderoni, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. “This is a clear validation of our team’s outstanding work and the start of an exciting new chapter for Anaplan, our customers, and our partner ecosystem. We are confident that Thoma Bravo’s resources and insights will help us accelerate and scale our growth strategy.” Before going public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2018, Anaplan raised over $240 million in funding from the likes of Amazon- and Tesla-backer Baillie Gifford, as well as Salesforce. It also relocated its headquarters to San Francisco, California. “Anaplan is a clear leader in Connected Planning, solving critical business priorities for the world’s largest enterprises as they implement strategic and complex digital transformations,” said Holden Spaht, a Managing Partner at Thoma Bravo. “We have followed Anaplan for years and have seen the incredible value they bring customers through their best-in-class planning platform. We look forward to leveraging Thoma Bravo’s extensive operational and investment expertise in enterprise software to support Anaplan in its future growth.” Thoma Bravo has more than $103 billion in assets under management."

Then last week, anew study from Israeli cybersecurity company CHEQ found that12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots. The study, which was firstreportedbyJerusalem Post, found that “up to 12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.” The finding also gave Musk the ammunition he needed to back out of the $44 billion takeover deal. Some legal experts also said that Musk could also use the “inflated user data” as a bargaining chip to get a better deal. Fast forward to today, Musk is nowthreatening to terminate the $44 billion dealif fake-account data is not provided. Inwhat his lawyers described as Twitter’s lack of transparency over the inflated user data, Musk accused Twitter of “resisting and thwarting” his inquiries about how many fake, or bot accounts are currently on the Twitter platform. Musk reportedly called Twitter’s unwillingness to provide the information a “clear material breach” of the terms of the agreement that is still under negotiation. As a result, Musk said he’s reserving his right to not complete the transaction. In the letter to Twitter Chief Legal Officer Vijaya Gadde, Skadden attorney Mike Ringler for Musk said that “Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,” according to CNBC. He said further that Twitter must provide the information that is being requested, and that the merger agreement requires it. Ringler disputed Twitter’s claim that they are not responsible to give that data in order to close the deal. “Mr. Musk is entitled to seek, and Twitter is obligated to provide,” Ringler wrote, “information and data for, inter alia, ‘any reasonable business purpose related to the consummation of the transaction.'” “At this point,” Ringler continued, “Mr. Musk believes Twitter is transparently refusing to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement, which is causing further suspicion that the company is withholding the requested data due to concern for what Mr. Musk’s own analysis of that data will uncover.” The letter, submitted to the SEC, stated that “If Twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates, Mr. Musk does not understand the company’s reluctance to allow Mr. Musk to independently evaluate those estimates. As noted in our previous correspondence, Mr. Musk will of course comply with the restrictions provided under Section 6.4, including by ensuring that anyone reviewing the data is bound by a non-disclosure agreement, and Mr. Musk will not retain or otherwise use any competitively sensitive information if the transaction is not consummated.” On April 25, Twitter agreed to sell the company to Elon Musk for $44 billion.Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive$54.20in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing the proposed transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter’s closing stock price onApril 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter.Musk needed to use his Tesla stock to raise $21 billion in equity to fund his takeover of the social media giant.

However, crypto investors are not the only winners. Crypto scammers also had a blockbuster year with a windfall of$14 billion in stolen cryptocurrency during the year, thanks in large part to the rise ofdecentralized finance (DeFi). According to a Friday report fromthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC), at least46,000 people reported losing over $1 billion in cryptocurrency scams since the start of 2021. The report further confirmed our earlier report in January that scammers are cashing in big on the crypto craze after bitcoin reached a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. “Since the start of 2021, more than 46,000 people have reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to scams[1] – that’s about one out of every four dollars reported lost,[2] more than any other payment method. The median individual reported loss? A whopping $2,600. The top cryptocurrencies people said they used to pay scammers were Bitcoin (70%), Tether (10%), and Ether (9%),” FTC says. Although cryptocurrency is yet to become a mainstream payment method, FTC findings show that crypto has become an alarmingly common method for scammers to get peoples’ money. During the period, FTC also found that nearly half the people who reported the loss to a fraud originated on social media, far more than any other payment method. For the victims, the scamstarted with an ad, post, or a message they saw on a social media platform.FTC added that the top platforms identified in these reports were Instagram (32%), Facebook (26%), WhatsApp (9%), and Telegram (7%). The agency also addedthat about $575 million of all losses related to digital currency frauds were about “bogus investment opportunities.”The average reported loss for an individual was $2,600 and bitcoin, tether and ether were the top cryptocurrencies that people used to pay scammers, the FTC said. “Indeed, since 2021, $575 million of all crypto fraud losses reported to the FTC were about bogus investment opportunities, far more than any other fraud type.” FTC added, “The stories people share about these scams describe a perfect storm: false promises of easy money paired with people’s limited crypto understanding and experience. Investment scammers claim they can quickly and easily get huge returns for investors. But those crypto “investments” go straight to a scammer’s wallet. People report that investment websites and apps let them track the growth of their crypto, but it’s all fake. Some people report making a small “test” withdrawal – just enough to convince them it’s safe to go all in. When they really try to cash out, they’re told to sendmorecrypto for (fake) fees, and they don’t get any of their money back.” Meanwhile, it wasn’t just all about cryptocurrency fraud. “Romance scamsare a distant second to investment scams, with $185 million in reported cryptocurrency losses since 2021,” FTC says."

2022.6.6,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/06/seamless-ux-enabler-api-led-connectivity-model-elevate-user-experience/,"In its Top 7 trends shaping digital transformation in 2022 report, Mulesoft claimed the 2020s as the era of seamless digital experiences, enabled by modular software design. All more often, consumers are expecting the same quality of user experience (UX) from their service provider (SP) as they receive from tech giants like Amazon and Meta. Here, Hamish White, founder and CEO of telecoms SaaS solution provider Mobilise explains how a composable business model and a modular API-led architecture is an SP’s best friend. Organizations that have adopted innovation must not just be able to use it, but use it well enough to deliver a seamless digital UX. Consumers expect the same highly engaging experience from every single brand they interact with, so smaller SPs must offer a UX that’s on a par with tech giants to remain competitive and keep their customers happy. Offering digital services is essential in our modern digital society. A consistent, intuitive user interface is a core differentiator for SPs seeking a competitive edge, contributing to a positive CX and ultimately preventing churn. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Future of CX report, 32 percent of all customers would stop doing business with a brand they once loved after just one bad experience. So, a positive UX right from the start is crucial. In today’s digital society, data is king. But despite the widespread recognition of its power, most organizations don’t have a comprehensive data strategy in place. According to Capgemini’s Master the customer experience report, just 21 percent of brands have an integrated, holistic view of all customer information. For the others, data is scattered in silos in incompatible formats, and in some cases, it’s not even captured and stored. But APIs help to solve these issues. API-led connectivity links data to applications through application programming interfaces (APIs). It decouples data from the business logic and experience layer to create functions specifically with CX in mind. APIs are developed for specific purposes, but once created, they are reusable. So, adopting an API-led connectivity model allows an organization to create ecosystems of applications that are modular, purposeful, and reusable, enabling businesses to operate with more agility. Implementing API integrations, or an orchestration layer, into an organization’s digital infrastructure supports digital CX in many ways. APIs enable the full integration of external systems and third-party services so that processes appear seamless. What is actually a sequence of several individual processes and triggers behind the scenes, enabled through applications from several vendors, can appear as a single interaction with a customer. For example, in telecoms, when onboarding a new customer through an in-app eSIM subscription, subscriber provisioning, stock management and Know Your Customer (KYC) are all handled by APIs. Yet for the customer, all that’s required is the tap of a button. APIs also create a centralized architecture to unite data from various business systems and give one version of the truth to every corner of an organization. Data orchestration is the process of taking siloed data from multiple storage locations, collating and organizing it, and making it available for analysis. Data orchestration enables businesses to automate and streamline data-driven decision-making, a necessary capability for organizations to succeed in a digital-first world. Yet the largest benefit of adopting an API-led modular architecture is its impact on operational agility. SPs can become more flexible in their technical architecture and create a truly digital ecosystem. By adding new service offerings, like additional payment gateways, simply and quickly through reusable APIs, SPs can offer their customers a greater level of choice, constantly improving CX. What’s more, modularity means that SPs can freely switch the technologies they integrate into their digital propositions without impacting functionality or needing extended periods of downtime this also avoids vendor lock-in. For smaller SPs, having the resources and expertise to successfully implement an API-led digital architecture may seem an impossible task. Mobilise’s HERO is a digital BSS platform that enables SPs to deliver a digital-first customer experience. Through its orchestration layer, which is fully compliant with the TM Forum Open API Specifications, there are over 60 APIs available to integrate into the front and back-end systems, for functions including self-service, eSIM provisioning, payments, in-app push notifications, a marketplace for cross-selling, and user profiles maintenance.  Preventing churn, maintaining satisfied customers, and elevating CX are essential to success in the ever more competitive telecoms space. Creating a consistent, intuitive digital ecosystem, powered by APIs gives SPs the ongoing flexibility to adapt and keep pace with innovation.

Aluwi co-founded Gojek over a decade ago along with Michaelangelo Moran, and Nadiem Makarim. Chief Executive Andre Soelistyo would assume Aluwi’s responsibilities at the senior level and it would not be looking for a successor, GoTo Group said in a statement. The announcement came just a month afterthe company’s $1.1 billion initial public offerings. As we reported back in April, the former e-commerce tech startup GoTo raised $1.5 billion in IPO to become Indonesia’s fourth most-valuable company at a $28B valuation. GoTo said its group Chief Executive Andre Soelistyo would assume Aluwi’s responsibilities at the senior level and it would not be looking for a successor. In a statement, Gojek Chief Executive Kevin Aluwi said:“After almost a decade of leading Gojek, I feel that the time is right for me to move to a less day-to-day role.“As a member of the board of commissioners, I will continue to be involved at a strategic level with GoTo management, and also have more time to explore my personal interests within the technology space.” Goto Group was formed in 2021 as a result of a mergerof ride-hailing-to-payments company Gojek and e-commerce giant Tokopedia. GoTo currently has over 2.5 million registered driver-partners, 14 million registered merchants, and 55 million annual transacting users as of the end of September 2021.The merger helps Gojek and Tokopedia take on larger, regional rivals such as Singapore-headquartered Grab and internet company Sea, which operates the e-commerce platform Shopee and has a digital payments and financial services business. GoTo Group’s business now spans ride-hailing, financial services, and e-commerce. Founded in 2010 by Kevin Aluwi, Michaelangelo Moran, and Nadiem Makarim, Gojek is an app for ordering food, commuting, digital payments, shopping, hyper-local delivery, getting a massage, and two dozen services. It is Indonesia’s first and fastest-growing decacorn building an on-demand empire across Southeast Asia. The Gojek app was launched in 2015 in Indonesia and is now the largest consumer transactional technology group on a GTV-basis in Southeast Asia."

In 2021 alone, NFT collectors and tradersspent $22 billion on NFTs, up from $100 million in 2020, according to the Guardian.But the NFT market appears to be cooling off and sales are flattening. In the first week of May,for example, the sale of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) fell to a daily average of about 19,000, a huge decline from its peak of about 225,000 in September 2021, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, citing data from NFT tracking website NonFungible. NFT is a type of cryptographic token on ablockchainthat represents a unique digital asset. They are digital assets that represent real-world objects — such as art, music, real estate, and beyond — and can’t be replicated. While many NFT marketplaces experienced sales decline, Tezos NFT Platform Objkt.com is thriving and surging.Despite the NFT sales downturn in the month of May, the energy-efficient Tezos blockchainObjkt.com had its best month, surpassing $100 million in sales in May. During the samemonth, an NFT art piece titled REACHBACK was sold on Objkt.com for a whopping 82k tez. The news follows a trend of NFT sales on Tezos surging, while competing marketplaces are experiencing periods of sharp decline. What’s so amazing is the$100 million in surging sales and an 82k tez sale didn’t really tell the whole story. Digging deeper, we found thatNFT sales on Tezos are actually up by over 50% in the last 30 days while Ethereum NFT sales are down nearly 70%. In addition, the 82k tez sale did not happen on Tezos by accident. The artist, XCOPY, a well-known ETH artist who has minted other versions of the REACHBACK series on OpenSea, minted the original REACHBACK NFT on Tezos indie marketplace HicetNunc in April 2021. The piece, originally listed and sold for 5 tez, instantly became an item of folklore. The piece was listed multiple times for between 10k – 30k tez until it was purchased for 31,337 tez in August 2021. The other versions of REACHBACK on OpenSea failed to sell for over $20,000. The sale of REACHBACK, which is part of an edition of 3, for 82k marks an important milestone for the Tezos NFT community – demonstrating the stigma of it as a low-priced, experimental space is dead and its legacy as the place for high-priced NFT art is beginning to form. The emergence of Tezos as the premier blockchain of choice for artists is being voiced by some of the leading figures in the digital art world. Snoop Dogg’s alter-ego, Cozomo de Medici, recently said in a post on Twitter: “If you’re not collecting on objkt.com, are you even collecting?” https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1533562800504598528 That’s not all, fx(hash), anopen platform to create and collect generative NFTs on the tezos blockchain, alsoreported surging volume amidst a general NFT market downturn with nearly $6 million in sales in May. The open generative art platform built on the Tezos network overtook Ethereum-based Art Blocks in total sales earlier this month for the first time. The Tezos Foundation was founded by Johann Gevers. Tezos was created in 2014 byhusband-and-wife team Arthur and Kathleen Breitman. Tezos is smart money, redefining what it means to hold and exchange value in a digitally connected world. A self-upgradable and energy-efficient Proof of Stake blockchain with a proven track record, Tezos seamlessly adopts tomorrow’s innovations without network disruptions today."

In just a few years,DeFI has grown to an $80 billion industry in 2021 and is poised to explode 10-fold, according toDeFi platformVesper.At the current rate,DeFi is poised to transform and revolutionize the traditional financial systems that have existed for thousands of years into decentralized models and gives control to the people. One startup that’s leading the DeFi revolution isCake DeFi,a Singapore-based fintech platform that’s making decentralized finance more accessible to the masses.Cake DeFi says its vision is to eventually become a true one-stop platform where users can manage all their financial assets. The fintech startup has been pushing the envelope toempower users to harness the potential of DeFi and theservices and applications accessible to everyonesince its inception three years ago. Today, Cake DeFi celebrated its third anniversary today with a key milestone. Marking its 3rd Anniversary, Cake DeFi announced it has paid out over $317 million to customers. In addition, the fintech startup also announced it now has over $1 billion of customer assets on its platform, as of the end first quarter of 2022, further highlighting the growing users’ interest and trust in the company. Commenting on the milestone achievement, Cake DeFi co-Founder and CEODr Julian Hosp said,“Our third anniversary is an important milestone for us. Despite the recent downturn in crypto prices, we have continued to experience tremendous growth in the past three years. We are now one of the fastest-growing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms in Asia. This is only made possible by relentlessly creating value for our customers – we paid out a staggering US$317 million in rewards in just three years.” Hosp also added: “We achieved this by creating a safe and secure one-stop platform for consumers to easily access DeFi services. The next stage of our growth will come from building access to DeFi and Web3 not just for consumers, but for businesses as well. It is our ambition to list Cake DeFi on a public stock exchange in the near future. We were offered a SPAC merger at US$1.5 billion but we had turned it down earlier in the year.” The numbers prove Cake DeFi growth.Since its launch in 2019, Cake DeFi has empowered thousands of users as part of its financial inclusion mission, while it continues to advocate the responsible investment of crypto assets to generate passive income.In just three years,Cake DeFi already has close to a million registered users andover US$1 billion of total customer assets on the platform. Beyond the numbers, Cake DeFi also said that it intends to continue to focus more on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives with programs to drive sustainability in decentralized finance – and the broader crypto and blockchain industry. The startup recently partnered with SportCares, the team that lets vulnerable individuals experience and reap the benefits of sports by elevating their outlook on life. In addition to millions of dollars in rewards to customers, Cake DeFi also announced today that it had reached a licensing milestone in the EU and is now authorized to conduct services for exchanging cryptocurrency, and providing and administering cryptocurrency custodial wallets in Lithuania. “This is a key step and will facilitate Cake DeFi’s cryptocurrency registration and authorization in other EEA member states and for future conversion into an EU-wide cryptocurrency authorization when the EU Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) Regulations become effective,” the company said in its three-year anniversary announcement. Cake DeFi currently holds an exemption under the Payment Services (Exemption for Specified Period) Regulations 2019 granted by the MAS which allows it to continue operating in and from Singapore while the MAS is processing its license application to conduct digital payment token services. U-Zyn Chua, CTO and Co-Founder of Cake DeFi said, “R&D is in the DNA of any good tech firm. Our R&D arm Birthday Research makes up a third of our company’s strength and was formed to develop best-in-class blockchain innovations to drive the evolution of Web3. These innovations will in turn create more value for our customers with market-leading products in the DeFi space. In the coming quarters, users can look forward to a revolutionary DeFi product that will bring unbeatable yields to the industry. And as we integrate more blockchains into our platform, we will be able to deliver even more sophisticated DeFi products to our users.” Furthermore, Cake DeFi has achieved a licensing milestone across the European Union, enabling the team to conduct services in Lithuania. Those services will include exchanging cryptocurrency and providing cryptocurrency custodial wallets. A push into other EEA member states is ongoing.

Today, the Crypto.com-backed Cronos announced the launch of a Cronos Accelerator Program to provide funding and guidance for early-stage blockchain projects and accelerate the growth of its ecosystem. The program was funded by the $100 million Cronos Labs Ecosystem Fund. Developers and builders can take part in a 10-week program with a $100 million war chest.As part ofThe Cronos Accelerator Program,Cronoswill provide investments of $100,000 to $300,000 in early-stage projects and additional grant funding for security audits, node services, and gas fees. During the program, Cronos will also pair startups with mentors and provide weekly workshops on topics associated with protocol building. In addition, participating startups will be able to explore investment opportunities with Cronos’ VC partners. The program also provides an excellent opportunity for blockchain projects that find themselves in the seed-pre-seed stage and are looking for funding, mentorship, growth, or a combination of the above. According to the announcement, The Cronos Accelerator Program will primarily focus on advanced DeFi, Web3 Gaming & Metaverse, and Infrastructure & Tooling. The Cronos Accelerator Program includes additional grant funding for security audits, node services, and gas fees. In addition, the program will provide investment opportunities from established VC partners, marketing support, and access to the growing Cronos user base through social media channels, AMA webinars, and introductions. The program also providesbusiness advisory from Cronos Labs and industry mento and weekly 1-on-1 mentorship and networking with industry leaders, andintroductions to Crypto.com ecosystem: DeFi Wallet, Exchange, App, and NFT Marketplace Projects accepted to become part of the Cronos Accelerator Program will be matched with reputable industry mentors. Additionally, there are weekly workshops led by Cronos Labsand external subject matter experts. These workshops will cover various topics associated with protocol building. The Cronos Accelerator has a top-tier line-up of key partners who will be supporting projects in the Accelerator through investments, mentorship, and workshops. Partners include Mechanism Capital, Spartan Labs, IOSG Ventures, OK Blockchain Capital, AP Capital, Altcoin Buzz, Dorahacks, and many more to be announced at a later stage. Cronos Managing Director Ken Timsit said that participating projects can expect to raise between $500,000 to $2 million in initial investments from Cronos labs and third-party investors. Timsitadds: “Through Cronos Accelerator, we want to enhance the potential of projects that sincerely want to help grow the ecosystem by providing support in almost every area of their operations. In the current climate, it is more important than ever to put our heads down and start building aggressively. We are a top 10 blockchain via Total Value Locked at the moment, and are on track to reach the top 5 by the end of 2022.” “We are looking for what we think Cronos users and, more broadly, the users of the crypto ecosystem, would be interested in, such as products that are easy to understand, easy to use and to unlock,” Timsit told CoinDesk. Startup founders don’t have to come to the program with a fully fleshed-out project, Timsit said. “Not all projects are fully formed, and it’s very unlikely that the project, in the end, is going to look like what the pitch deck looks like at the application stage,” Timsit told CoinDesk. “But what will make a difference is whether the founder and co-founders have a track record of figuring things out and delivering [products].” Cronos VP Ella Qiang states: “After speaking with many projects in the industry, we realised that while many have high potential, they may not have all the tools they need to stand out and build sustainable tokenomics. We want to provide the necessary support for early stage projects and accelerate their growth on Cronos.” The Cronos Accelerator Program is funded by the $100 million Cronos Labs Ecosystem Fund. There will be 3-4 cohorts per year, featuring an average of 10 start-ups per cohort.

Cronos has already skyrocketed to a top 10 position among all chains by total value locked and is used by >800,000 users, growing at 20% per month. Cronos is powered by the Cronos ($CRO) cryptocurrency, which powers an ecosystem of more than 50 million users worldwide.Cronos Labs is the ecosystem investment fund, web3 start-up accelerator, and incubator of the Cronos chain."
2022.6.7,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/07/emergence-smart-glasses-retire-smartphones/,"The rise of the smartphone has been nothing short of meteoric. The watershed moment of the arrival of the iPhone 3 in 2008 sparked a love affair that’s seen millions forge an inseparable connection to their handheld devices which can help them to explore the internet, play games, engage in online banking, stream content, and connect with anyone in the world. Now, some of the world’s most prominent executives are suggesting that the smartphone may soon become a thing of the past. With the arrival of augmented reality eyewear and the metaverse, handheld connectivity may ultimately give way to hands-free devices in the form of augmented reality eyewear and headsets. These glasses will be capable of performing the tasks that we’ve become accustomed to doing on smartphones in a more immersive and intuitive way. Packed with cameras, speakers, and microphones, smart glasses can be every bit as responsive as smartphones – they can even be controlled via eye-tracking in an innovation that phones haven’t replicated. Newer pieces of smart eyewear include waveguide displays that essentially bends projected light before our eyes, which enables us to see a visual field that can deliver a crisp resolution and a greater field of view. (Image: AR Insider) The most significant innovation that could propel smart glasses towards mainstream acceptance, however, is its incorporation of augmented reality – or mixed reality – technology. This tech can help to deliver actionable information about objects in our line of sight and are capable of functioning as a computer monitor delivered directly into our line of sight. As we can see from the chart above, the AR glasses market is set to grow significantly over the coming years, with nearly 7 million units set to be sold in 2024. Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg ramped up his efforts to accommodate the growing smart glasses ecosystem in Meta’s upcoming eyewear products. “Great to be back in Milan to discuss plans for new smart glasses with Leonardo Del Vecchio and the EssilorLuxottica team,” Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. “Here Leonardo is using a prototype of our neural interface EMG wristband that will eventually let you control your glasses and other devices. Significantly, Zuckerberg confirmed that Meta is angling towards adopting EMG (electromyography) technology in the form of a wristband that monitors electrical motor nerve signals traveling through the wearer’s wrist to convert into digital commands that can operate its future eyewear models. This quest for greater levels of control is a clear attempt to improve Meta’s current smart glasses range, called Ray-Ban Stories, to give users a similar level of functionality that smartphones offer. NOKIA CEO Pekka Lundmark has a keen eye on similar levels of innovation and recently suggested that the eventual arrival of the next generation of data, 6G will spell the end of the smartphone, with smart glasses and other wearables becoming powerful enough to take over. “By then, definitely the smartphone as we know it today will not anymore be the most common interface. Many of these things will be built directly into our bodies,” Lundmark explained. The emergence of AR glasses also offers a solution to the fact that vision can be a very subjective sense for different people. With as much as 75% of the global population requiring some form of vision correction, smart glasses can be a great opportunity for users to receive adaptive treatment for problems with sight. In January 2022, Apple filed a patent for ‘Tunable and foveated lens systems’, which enables smart glasses to adjust their lenses to provide vision correction. Using a stack of liquid crystal and non-liquid crystal displays, Apple proposes that its glasses operate in a similarly adaptive way to how Varilux progressive lenses behave in smoothly adjusting to different circumstances and environments to offer a smooth and clear quality of vision. The technology could even use eyesight tracking technology to adapt to cater to whether the user is looking at an object in the distance or something close up. The patent could pave the way for the widespread adoption of smart glasses as a functional and viable alternative to prescription lenses. Despite the vast potential of smart glasses with augmented reality capabilities, not all company decision-makers agree that they will ultimately replace the smartphone. When asked about a future integrated with the metaverse, Motorola’s head of customer experience, Ruben Castano said: “At the center of it will always be the smartphone. The smartphone is a very personal device. It’s something that you always carry with you.” With the arrival of the metaverse, we’re likely to see one of the biggest technological disruptions in history. Mounting evidence suggests that many tech leaders believe the future of Web3.0 will rely on the development of intuitive smart glasses. Whether or not there’s also room for the smartphone remains to be seen. But with the hands-free interconnectivity and health benefits attached to adaptive smart glasses, the future certainly looks bright for the eyewear industry."

Over the past few years, some of these companies have adopted non-financial factors and amore stakeholder-centric approach to doing business using what is known as ESG. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. Investors and businesses alike are increasingly applying ESG as criteria for making decisions about their company’s operations, global impacts, and what they invest their money on. For example, companies are now divesting from fossil fuels projects to investing in renewables like solar and wind. To further help companies to manage and improve their ESG footprint and reporting,Datia, a Stockholm, Sweden-basedClimate fintech startup has developed solutions to help organizationsstreamline ESG workflows allowing for easy understanding of the impact of portfolios, regulatory reporting, and pre-trade screening.

2022.6.7,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/07/thetanuts-finance-launches-stronghold-vaults-organic-yield-generation-risk-diversification/,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow at an astronomical rate as millions of users and investors bypass the centralized traditional banks to trade directly with one another. In just four years since its inception, DeFI has grown to an $80 billion industry in 2021 and is poised to explode 10-fold, according toDeFi platform Vesper. Now, DeFi may have just got its S&P moment with a new decentralized yield diversification fund by Thetanuts Finance with their new Stronghold product.Thetanuts is a structured DeFi platform that simplifies the process of options trading. The fintech startuphelps users to access crypto structured products on multiple decentralized networks to generate a return for their portfolio. Today,Thetanuts announced the launch of the Thetanuts Stronghold index vault, a new trading product that offers non-inflationary return opportunities, thoughtful risk management, and a radically simpler user experience.Unlike other DeFi products out there,Stronghold earns yields by running an automated index of call or put strategies.This is the project’s first big move since raising $18M from a strong list of investors a few months ago. Thetanuts Stronghold enables users to avoid the headaches associated with options strategies by staking their assets directly into DeFi Option Vaults. It performs a similar function to the S&P 500 in stock trading, representing customized option vault indexes created by Thetanuts researchers that aim to provide users with organic yield generated from option selling, benchmarked against major ecosystem tokens. Through the Thetanuts Stronghold protocol, user’s staked assets are automatically deployed into specified covered selling option strategies through the use of smart contracts. The base yield is obtained via the payment of premiums as opposed to the inflationary token rewards seen in many other DeFi protocols. Users receive a yield-bearing token that generates superior returns by selling options across the curve, while benefiting from a diversified risk profile. The strike prices and expirations of each Stronghold strategy are algorithmically determined to generate the highest risk-adjusted yield. “I am excited about Thetanuts Stronghold because it gives users great risk adjusted returns through selling diversified option selling strategies.” said Stelian Balta CEO of Hyperchain, an investor in Thetanuts. He added “great team and looking forward to Thetanuts being the future benchmark of yield generation.” The protocol aims to solve problems around choice paralysis, liquidity lock and concentrated risk. With competing protocols, investors are faced with a choice of multiple put vaults on the same chain, which can make it difficult to decide which one is most suitable. In addition, once users enter a vault position on other protocols, their liquidity is collateralized and can only be withdrawn once the vault expires. Finally, single strike single tenor vaults carry the risk of going in-the-money on one strike. With Thetanuts Stronghold, investors benefit from simpler investment choices and are able to withdraw their liquidity at any time, while risk management is achieved by diversification. The Stronghold indexes are backed by multi strike, multi tenor, multi asset options vaults aggregated into a single Stronghold token, protecting users from excessive vault draw-downs in bearish market conditions. In addition, the multi strike, multi tenor strategy protects users from temporary market downturns via mean reversion. Investors further benefit from an improved user interface courtesy of two major updates. All Thetanuts Stronghold products have been consolidated into a single, simplified panel, allowing users to easily discover assets to generate yield on, interact with the indexes they’re most suited to, and understand which blockchain their assets are hosted on. Meanwhile, yield generation becomes as simple as a swap – simply swap the underlying asset for Stronghold and vice versa with a single click, moving into and out of a position at any time. Thetanuts Stronghold has launched initially with the USDC Stronghold index vault and is live now on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Avalanche, with Polygon, Fantom, and other chains launching soon. As the product gains traction among DeFi investors over the coming months, Thetanuts will launch other Stronghold indexes for additional major crypto assets. Launched in August 2021, Thetanuts is founded by a team of programmers, hedge fund managers, and financial analysts who specialize in building financial crypto products. Thetanuts Finance’s DeFi structured products and its customizable vaults are the future of generating yield. The platform is designed to provide treasury management for DAOs, as well as help retail traders earn yields on their tokens. Thetanuts’ vaults simplify the process of options trading, making previously complex instruments easy for any investor to access, empowering users to monetize volatility in a risk-adjusted manner."

In the last two years alone,Pitango has invested in more than 20 companies and have 40 active companies in our portfolio including four unicorns. Today,Pitango announced the launch of First Labs, a thesis-driven web3 lab designed to bridge the traditional economy and web3. Israel’s leading venture capital firm, Pitango operates seed and early venture fund Pitango First. The latter has now masterminded First Labs, which incorporates Israel’s first investment DAO to support the needs of web3 investors, entrepreneurs, and developers. First Labs will support investment in early-stage companies utilizing web3 technologies including blockchain, tokenization, NFTs, and metaverses. It will identify ventures that have sustainable growth models through equity and/or token-based investments. More than just a web3 investment fund, First Labs will provide the mentoring to help projects realize their potential by introducing them to its extensive partner network. Ayal Itzkovitz, Managing Partner at PItango First: “We’ve been involved in the crypto space in the last five years and have been following it closely. We believe that the time is ripe to bring the VC and crypto native community together in a new, modern, and relevant vehicle that will foster innovation and support sustainable venture building in the Web 3.0 space” In keeping with the democratic, community-centric principles that underpin web3, First Labs will operate a novel investment DAO, known as First DAO. Founding members of the DAO include Aviv Barzilay, core members of the Pitango First team, and leading blockchain figures including Tomer Weiss, Amit Peled, Oren De-lange and MarketAcross partners Nadav Dekner, Elad Mor, and Itai Elizur. Aviv Barzilay, Head of First Labs said: “From liquidity mining to token engineering, First Labs is designed to answer the unique needs of the crypto space. Our platform will allow founders and community members to connect and will empower web2 companies to make the leap into web3 with confidence. Having partnered with top crypto-native companies and domain experts, First Labs has the expertise to unlock the web3 universe and everything it has to offer.” Despite the vast potential that web3 holds for fostering highly engaged communities, centered around asset ownership, tokenization, virtual worlds, and global access, it remains isolated from the traditional tech world. First Labs will aim to bridge this divide, onboarding web2 companies to the fast-growing space while making it easier for investors to identify the first wave of web3 unicorns. First DAO will incorporate the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization over time, gradually assigning stewardship to its community. Having exited stealth mode today, First Labs intends to launch its first program to accelerate web3 teams within two months. Its community members will play a pivotal role in advancing the developments of ideas and concepts around the projects it supports in the First Labs Program. Founded in 1993 byChemi Peres, Aharon Dovrat, Habib Hazzan, Rami Kalish,Pitangois Israel’s largest venture capital fund with over $1.8 billion under management.

According to the Post, the social media giant will provide Musk with access to a stream of data comprising more than 500 million tweets posted every day. On Monday,Musk warned he might walk away from the $44 billion takeover deal to acquire the company if Twitter fails to provide the data on the bot, spam, and fake accounts that he requested.Inwhat his lawyers described as Twitter’s lack of transparency over the inflated user data, Musk accused Twitter of “resisting and thwarting” his inquiries about how many fake, or bot accounts are currently on the Twitter platform. Musk reportedly called Twitter’s unwillingness to provide the information a “clear material breach” of the terms of the agreement that is still under negotiation. As a result, Musk said he’s reserving his right to not complete the transaction. In the letter to Twitter Chief Legal Officer Vijaya Gadde, Skadden attorney Mike Ringler for Musk said that “Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,” according to CNBC. He said further that Twitter must provide the information that is being requested, and that the merger agreement requires it. Ringler disputed Twitter’s claim that they are not responsible to give that data in order to close the deal. “Mr. Musk is entitled to seek, and Twitter is obligated to provide,” Ringler wrote, “information and data for, inter alia, ‘any reasonable business purpose related to the consummation of the transaction.’” “At this point,” Ringler continued, “Mr. Musk believes Twitter is transparently refusing to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement, which is causing further suspicion that the company is withholding the requested data due to concern for what Mr. Musk’s own analysis of that data will uncover.” The letter, submitted to the SEC, stated that “If Twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates, Mr. Musk does not understand the company’s reluctance to allow Mr. Musk to independently evaluate those estimates. As noted in our previous correspondence, Mr. Musk will of course comply with the restrictions provided under Section 6.4, including by ensuring that anyone reviewing the data is bound by a non-disclosure agreement, and Mr. Musk will not retain or otherwise use any competitively sensitive information if the transaction is not consummated.” On April 25, Twitter agreed to sell the company to Elon Musk for $44 billion.Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive$54.20in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing the proposed transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter’s closing stock price onApril 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter.Musk needed to use his Tesla stock to raise $21 billion in equity to fund his takeover of the social media giant.

Back then,Immuta raised $40M in Series C funding led by Intel Capital to grow its automated data governance and privacy platform. Today,Immuta announced it has secured $100 million in Series E funding tomeet the growing data security and privacy demands by accelerating secure data access across all cloud platforms.The latest round, which brings Immuta’s total financing to date to $267 million, was led by NightDragon. The funding round also includes new investor Snowflake Ventures, the venture capital arm of the Data Cloud company, as well as participation from existing investors Dell Technologies Capital, DFJ Growth, IAG, Intel Capital, March Capital, StepStone, Ten Eleven Ventures, and Wipro Ventures. Founded in 2014 by Matthew Carroll, Michael Schiller, Sapan Shah, and Steven Touw,Immutaprovides data teams with one universal platform to control access to analytical data sets in the cloud. Its automated data governance software platform creates trust across security, legal, compliance, and business teams so they can work together to ensure timely access to critical business data with minimal risks. “There is a major shift in the modern data stack as organizations scale to derive value from their data more quickly, while also protecting their data assets and adhering to privacy regulations,” said Immuta CEO Matthew Carroll. “We’ve entered the next wave of the cloud data evolution where automation and security are essential to meeting modern cloud and data demands. This new funding will help propel Immuta into our next phase of growth as we continue to revolutionize cloud data access and data security.” “As the threat landscape continues to escalate and cloud migration continues, we’re seeing increased global interest in the need for secure data access solutions,” said Dave DeWalt, former CEO of FireEye, McAfee, Documentum and now Founder and Managing Director at NightDragon. “Immuta is the clear market leader in providing secure data access, providing data teams with one universal platform to control access to data at scale. Many of the world’s top data-driven organizations – Roche, Mercedes-Benz Group, IAG, and the U.S. Army – rely on Immuta every day to quickly, safely, and efficiently share more data with more users. We’re excited to be making this investment in such a critical part of the modern data stack.” Immuta enables organizations to discover, protect, and monitor sensitive data so that users can access it – as long as they have the rights. From startups to global enterprises, organizations are struggling to provide access to data at scale while ensuring it’s done securely and in accordance with local rules and privacy regulations. The startup also offers customers the ability to secure their data in the cloud at a more granular level and easily enforce data security policies. Immuta is rapidly expanding to address these demands and recentlyannouncedits expansion into the Australian and New Zealand markets with the addition of new customers and new hires in the region. In 2021, Immuta further expanded its partner network of top cloud data platforms with native integrations to includeSnowflake,Databricks,Amazon,Google,Azure, andStarburst. “With this expanded partnership, enterprise customers can benefit from both Snowflake’s native data policies for data governance and Immuta’s simple, centralized, and comprehensive method for managing and automating data policy within specific workflows,” said Christian Kleinerman, Snowflake SVP of Product. “Together, customers have a solution for more seamless enforcement of data policy, ultimately allowing for more customer value. We look forward to partnering with Immuta through the next stages of its growth.”"
2022.6.8,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/08/london-based-fintech-startup-geode-finance-raises-3m-seed-funding-provide-daos-white-label-liquid-staking-solution/,"The exponential growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) has led to increased demand for liquid staking as billions in liquidity flow to projects into the DeFi space. Investors and users alike love liquid staking because of the potential to generate passive income without having to lock their liquidity into a vanilla staking solution. For the uninitiated, liquid staking protocols enable users to acquire liquidity on staked assets and use staked assets as collateral in (decentralized) financial applications through tokenization. One of the leading startups in this space is Geode Finance, a London-based DeFi startup creating the multichain liquid staking universe where different PoS chains are Galaxies and DAOs are Planets to be explored. Geode allows any DAO to have its own liquid staking solution with its white label product, thereby decentralizing the process while also improving network security. Today, Geode announced it has raised $3M in a seed funding round led by Multicoin Capital, with participation from other market makers and ecosystem partner GSR, blockchain investment fund C² Ventures, yield optimization protocol Yield Yak, and blockchain infrastructure provider Eden Network. With this funding,Geode Finance aims to revolutionize staking by providing DAOs with a customizable and easy to deploy liquid staking solution. Geode will also comprehensively support DAOs and protocols that integrate with Geode to launch their own liquid staking product and associated yield-bearing token. Co-founded bySimon Furlong, Geode Finance is a provider of white-label liquid staking solutions, tailor-made for DAOs. With Geode’s customizable liquid staking products, DAOs and their members are empowered with vastly improved yields, new revenue generation opportunities, and capital efficiency across the DeFi landscape on Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Geode will initially deploy on Avalanche Network, before expanding to Ethereum 2.0 and other popular proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains to facilitate the growth of the multichain economy. “Geode is building trustless white-label staking pools and derivatives products that provide granular control over delegation mechanics within proof-of-stake networks. The prospect of fully sovereign staking solutions is massively appealing for DAO treasuries, institutional capital allocators, and individual actors that lie across the risk spectrum,” said Shayon Sengupta, Investment Associate, Multicoin Capital. With this strategic investment from Multicoin Capital and supporting investors, Geode Finance aims to revolutionize staking by providing DAOs with a customizable and easy to deploy liquid staking solution. Geode will also comprehensively support DAOs and protocols that integrate with Geode to launch their own liquid staking product and associated yield-bearing token. DAOs are currently limited in their ability to diversify and earn a yield on their treasuries – which are worth over $10B in aggregate – or to offer their participating members meaningful reward incentives. Most do not end up leveraging the full potential of PoS networks, where everyone has the ability to get rewarded for their participation. The current options for DAOs include centralized solutions with non-negligible third-party risks and high management fees, or spending valuable time and developer resources to create their own staking solution. “In a proof-of-stake world, why shouldn’t all base assets generate yield? This is what has been driving our team to create streamlined solutions for everyone to take full advantage of yield generating possibilities. By providing our white label staking solution to DAOs without fees we instantly become a very compelling proposition, allowing any DAO to benefit by improving DAO economies and product offerings at large,” said Simon Furlong, Co-Founder and COO of Geode Finance. “We’re thrilled to be seed investors in Geode Finance. This partnership is a perfect fit for Yield Yak given we’re extremely excited about the potential of liquid staking and unlocking new yield potential for regular DeFi users. With a secure and user-friendly solution, we believe Geode’s novel liquid staking protocol will be a significant contributor to the future Web3 Ecosystems,” said Dylan Coady, Head of Communications at Yield Yak. Only about 65% of all AVAX in circulation is staked to validate the network, which means that approximately $6.5B worth of AVAX tokens is sitting idle in DAO treasuries and elsewhere, not earning any yield. At a conservative staking reward rate of 7%, this $6.5B worth of idle AVAX could be generating nearly $450M worth of AVAX rewards annually. Additionally, of the ~55% of AVAX supply that is currently staked, the majority is staked directly to validator nodes which provide only a single layer of returns via staking rewards. Geode addresses this gap in DAO infrastructure and tooling by offering a liquid staking solution that aligns with the values of decentralization and DeFi composability while striving to provide the highest possible yields on Avalanche Network. This feat is accomplished in part through a strategic partnership with Eden Network. Eden runs its own validators to support Geode’s operations while stacking multiple layers of yield through validation, subnet validation, and additional yield-boosting strategies, thereby increasing the amount of yield passed on to DAOs and their users that integrate this innovative solution. Despite the growing popularity of centralized B2C liquid staking solutions, there are few – if any – B2B2C liquid staking products tailor-made for DAOs. By combining several layers of staking and validator rewards, with a high degree of customizability and security, Geode Finance provides the ultimate infrastructure solution to support the growth of the multichain DAO economy. Importantly, Geode offers its services to DAOs at no cost."

At the time,Baidu was reportedly in talks with Chinese carmakers about making its own EVs. Then in January 2021, Baidu entered into an EV joint venture with Geely to launch a separate EV firm called Jidu Automotiveto target opportunities in the fast-growing smart EV market. A year later,Jidu Auto raised $400 millionto speed up research and development andspeed market entry. Today,Jidu Auto announced the launch of a “robot” concept car that can be fully controlled via voice recognition. It’s the first vehicle to be revealed by the company.The new concept car, which is free of door handles, was launched through an online press conference held on Baidu’s metaverse-themed app Xirang, Reuters reported. Unlike the current EV cars that use one autonomous driving solution,Jidu uses a dual LiDAR autonomous driving solution for its first model, withtwo separate systems serving as a backup to each other. Jidu said it plans to mass-produce the model, which would be 90% similar to the concept car, in 2023. Below is a video of Judi’s “robot” concept car.  Founded in 2000 by Eric Xu and Robin Li, Baidu is the largest Chinese language Internet search provider and search engine that enables individuals to obtain information and find what they need. Baidu offers functional online search, Tieba community search, industry-based vertical search, mp3 search, portal channels, and instant messaging services.

Now, the trillion-dollar tech giant is pushingfurther into finance and getting into the BNPL gamewiththe launch of Apple Pay Later. During its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) which started on Monday,Apple announced it plans to expand its fintech offeringswhen it launches the new iPhone software, iOS 16, this fall. The Apple Pay Laterwill allow Apple customers to buy things wherever Apple Pay is accepted and then pay for it in four payments over a period of six weeks, with no fees. Source: Apple.com According to the announcement,The Apple Pay Later, which is one of theseveral new features for the iPhone’s Wallet app, will enable Apple to directly compete with similar products from other fintech companies such asPayPal, Affirm, and Europe’s most valuable fintech startup Klarna. According to its website, “Apple Pay Later lets customers split a purchase into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees to pay. Apple Pay Later is available for purchases in apps and online when customers check out with Apple Pay.2 And it’s built into Wallet so customers can easily track what they owe and when they owe it.” Apple also said that by using the Mastercard network, Apple Pay Later just works with Apple Pay and requires no integration for merchants. The Buy now, pay later (BNPL) phenomenon has grown in popularity in recent years as consumers seek alternative methods of financing. BNPL is a new payment option that allows consumers to receive their purchase right away (Buy Now), either online or in-store, and then pay (Pay Later) for their purchase in installments.BNPL is now revolutionizing the customer journey by being seamlessly integrated into e-commerce as a checkout option. So far, BNPL accounts for only a small portion of overall credit card spending. However, with the coronavirus pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom, this alternative model of financing may be poised to disrupt the $8 trillion US payment card industry. As we reported late last month, Klarna announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce as the economic downturn hits buy now, pay later space. Inflation and recession have forced consumers to cut back on non-essential items like clothing to focus on basic needs such as food, healthcare, and energy. The economic downturn has rippled into the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector forcing companies to make tough cost-cutting decisions including hiring freezes and layoffs."

Terra was ranked among the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies before the collapse. The sudden crash caused Terra’s market capital to fall from above $40 billion to just $500 million overnight, resulting in unprecedented losses for investors in a leading cryptocurrency. The collapse of Terra sentshockwaves to the entire crypto market causing billions in losses to bitcoin and alt currencies like Ethereum and Solana. Fast forward nearly a month later, there are new revelations about what went wrong. According to multiple reports from the South Korean news agency Naver and JTBC,“before Terra collapsed, 100 billion won ($80 million) of company funds were withdrawn every month.” Per the reports, Do Kwon, the founder of collapsed Terra (LUNA) ecosystem, appears to now be in more trouble as the US Securities and Exchange Commission has reportedly got its hands on the money laundering activities of Do Kwon. The agency has also launched an investigation to enquire about Terra’s sudden fall. “The US Securities and Exchange Commission recently conducted a remote video survey of some of Terra’s key designers and focused on inquiring about Terra’s poor design structure,” Naver reported. Naver further stated that the SEC “has been investigating Kwon Do-Hyung for violating the Securities Act, claiming that the blockchain service that made it possible to buy US equities with Terra was a violation of the Securities Act.” Meanwhile,Do Kwon has lost an appeal attempting to block the honoring of subpoenas by the SEC over an ongoing investigation into the Mirror Protocol. The U.S. Second Circuit rejected the appeal in favor of the SEC.   As you may recall last, we wrote about The Luna Foundation Guard in early May after the company behind TerraUSD (UST) stablecoinacquired $1.5 billion in bitcointo bolster reserves of its popular stablecoin.Terra’s luna is a stablecoin designed to support UST’s one-to-one peg with the U.S. dollar. Below is the translated report from Korean to English. “The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reported to have caught on to the money laundering of CEO Kwon Do-hyeong, while the US investigative agency also launched an investigation into the allegations surrounding the collapse of the cryptocurrency Terra and Luna. On the 9th, JTBC reported, “The US Securities and Exchange Commission recently conducted a remote video survey of some of Terra’s key designers and focused on inquiring about Terra’s poor design structure.” Previously, the key designers revealed through JTBC, “We predicted the collapse of Terra and Luna and pointed out the danger to CEO Kwon Do-hyung several times, but they were ignored.” In particular , the SEC also discovered a circumstance in which about 100 billion won of company funds went out every month for operating expenses a few months before Terra collapsed . This is the part of CEO Kwon’s suspicion of ‘money laundering’ . The SEC has secured internal statements that ” the funds flowed into dozens of cryptocurrency wallets ,” JTBC reported . A key internal designer said , “( CEO Kwon Do-hyung ) has not officially received any payment from the company . There is no token set for him .” The SEC has been investigating Kwon Do-hyung for violating the Securities Act since May last year , judging that the blockchain service that made it possible to buy US stocks with Terra was a violation of the Securities Act .

While millions of Americans quit their job due to the Great Resignation, we’re surprised to learn that bob scams are still on the rise. The business and job opportunities fraud category includes offers for work-at-home jobs, like stuffing envelopes or processing medical claims, multi-level marketing schemes, job scams, job listings, employment services, inventions or idea promotions, and business opportunities. According to a report from Atlas VPN using public dataextracted and analyzed from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the past few months, US citizens lost over $68.3 million to various job and business offer scams in the first quarter of 2022. US Citizens can submit fraud reports to the FTC for further investigation. The FTC shares this data to inform the nation about the state of the cybercrime landscape in the US.All in all, US citizens have lost $701.4 million to bogus job and business opportunities since 2018. We will dissect the data into smaller increments to better understand this fraud type. To start, criminals swindled $17.7 million from unsuspecting victims in 2018 Q1, which comes out to around $197 thousand lost daily. These damages were a result of 1,969 scams with a median loss of $1,036. In contrast, Americans lost $68.3 million or nearly $759 thousand daily throughout the first quarter of 2022, which represents a growth of 285% over 2018 Q1. The FTC received 5,999 reports indicating a loss, with the median loss standing at $1,950. The report shows thatAmericans lost $68.3 million or nearly $759 thousand daily throughout the first quarter of 2022 to job and business offer fraud.The losses amounted to $62.5 million, or an average of $680 thousand per day in the fourth quarter of 2021. The jaw-dropping report also found that US citizens have lost $701.4 million to bogus job and business offers since 2018. Yet the significant upsurge in business and job opportunities scams started in 2021 Q4, where total losses amounted to $62.5 million, or an average of $680 thousand per day, a growth of 29% over 2021 Q3. The median loss was $2,000, while the number of reports totaled 6,353. The FTC notes that scammers advertise fake jobs in the newspapers, online, or even on signs, posters, and flyers. In a statement, Rhonda Perkins, attorney and chief of staff of the FTC division of marketing practices said: “We are definitely seeing job scams.” Perkins said that In 2021, the agency received more than twice the number of job scam reports than in 2020. More than 16,000 complaints were already filed in the first quarter of this year, the agency said."

Since its inception about two decades ago,the music streaming behemoth has seen explosive growth in revenue and a customer baseof over 400 million monthly active users, including over 160 million premium subscribers. The further incentivised its customers, Spotify promised high-margin returns from its costly expansion into podcasts and audiobooks. To reach thisambitious goal,Spotify is already expanding beyond music streaming through acquisitions and massive investments in podcasting and exclusive contracts. Founder and CEODaniel Ek forecasts the company’s gross margins to jump to 40% and operating margin to 20% during the period. Despite the alarm of recession and inflation, Spotify continues to add users and paying subscribers. In the first quarter alone, Spotify reported 422 million monthly users, ahead of the consensus estimate. However, one of the challenges the company faced for not reaching its long-term goals was its aggressive spending to build up its podcast and audiobooks platforms. However, Ek said the recent acquisitions and investments are already paying off adding that they are performing “better than you probably expect,” with gross margins of 28.5%, well on its way to reaching the company’s 30%-35% long-term goal. Now Ek istrying to reset Wall Street’s perceptions of the company.

2022.6.9,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/09/subquery-unveils-cosmos-data-indexing-via-juno-integration/,"Fresh from its recent announcement of its beta version implementation for Avalanche, SubQuery has delivered its latest iteration of multi-chain connectivity with the addition of support for the Cosmos ecosystem, starting with Juno. From today, Juno and other CosmWasm developers will be able to access the beta of the same fast, flexible, and open indexing solution widely used across the Polkadot and Avalanche ecosystems. This includes the open-source SDK, tools, documentation, developer support, and other benefits developers receive from the SubQuery ecosystem, including eligibility to participate in SubQuery’s Grants Programme. Additionally, Juno is accommodated by SubQuery’s managed service, which provides enterprise-level infrastructure hosting and handles over 400 million requests each day. Juno is a decentralized, public, and permissionless layer 1 for cross-chain smart contracts. Via its powerful hub employing a standardized communication protocol, it aims to be the internet of blockchains, benchmarking inter-chain security for network participants. Built on Cosmos, Juno facilitates blockchain interoperability in an ever-growing multi-chain environment. Jake Hartnell, the founder of another up-and-coming Cosmos chain, Stargaze, as well as a core Juno contributor, has shared “We were elated to learn that SubQuery was expanding their invaluable data indexing services over to Juno. Our shared mission is to provide new teams with an environment to scale without hindrance and we know that SubQuery saves developers time and effort, allowing them to accelerate even faster.” SubQuery provides decentralized data indexing infrastructure to developers building applications on multiple layer-1 blockchains. As an open data indexer that is flexible and fast, the open indexing tool helps developers build APIs in hours and quickly index chains with the assistance of dictionaries (pre-computed indices). Engineered for multi-chain applications, SubQuery’s tools allow developers to organize, store, and query on-chain data for their protocols and applications. SubQuery eliminates the need for custom data processing servers, helping developers focus on product development and user experience. SubQuery has already established itself as a data indexing solution on Polkadot, serving hundreds of millions of queries daily for projects like Moonbeam and Acala. This growth has spurred SubQuery to develop a priority list of six other Layer-1 blockchains they intend to serve in 2022. The addition of the Cosmos ecosystem alongside Polkadot and Avalanche aligns with SubQuery’s focus on networks that are also designed with a multi-chain outlook. While SubQuery’s Cosmos implementation begins with Juno, the product will eventually work with any CosmWasm-based chain, including Cronos, OKExChain, Osmosis, Secret Network, Stargaze, and Injective. Sam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, comments, “SubQuery is a fundamental piece of web3 infrastructure and we are delighted to support the explosive growth occurring in Cosmos and its native layers. We can’t wait to see how teams in the Juno ecosystem leverage SubQuery’s leading-edge indexing technology to build fast and feature-rich dApps.” In just a few months, Juno applications will be able to decentralize their SubQuery infrastructure completely with the SubQuery Network. The SubQuery Network will index and serve project data to the global community in an incentivized and verifiable manner. Designed to support any SubQuery project from any layer-1 network, including Juno and Cosmos, developers can leverage the scale of the unified SubQuery Network from launch. Developer documentation: https://university.subquery.network Getting started project: https://github.com/subquery/juno-subql-starter Discord community (including technical support): https://discord.com/invite/subquery Subquery said it plans to release a full developer onboarding guide tomorrow SubQuery is a blockchain developer toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organize and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Substrate, Avalanche, Terra, and Cosmos (starting with Juno) projects, this data-as-a-service allows developers to focus on their core use case and front-end without wasting time building a custom backend for data processing activities. In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralized manner."

2022.6.10,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/10/chinese-espionage-issues-technology-u-s-finally-step/,"Although it was already a formidable realm by the 1600s, China has had its share of economic, social, and political downturns. But the Asian Dragon always rose… and rose it did, thanks to trade with other willing nations. China’s modern progress was compounded by globalization, and trade made its past dynasties rich. Unfortunately, as it amassed wealth, China also fortified its drive to gather one of the most sought-after and critical materials that will create the superpower we know today – information. China did so by targeting two areas that have turned out to be the most productive and profitable – intellectual property and financial technology. Getting Serious & Stopping IP Theft China remains one of the most important trade partners for the United States. Behind this partnership, however, is a brewing trade war – a war made worse by China’s blatant indifference to IP protections that the U.S. imposed. The country’s leaders may agree to certain restrictions imposed by the U.S., but they apparently do so only on paper because hacking and intelligence activities continued unabated. A key area where Chinese espionage issues are especially worrying is the military. According to analysts, China’s own military technology grew significantly over the last few decades and is now nearly at par with the U.S. because the country stole sensitive data, including designs and manufacturing protocols. One of the ways China has successfully implemented intellectual property theft is hacking, leading to its production of advanced military equipment, including military drones and advanced missiles. In fact, China now boasts of its own stealth fighter jets – jets that feature the technology that was developed in the U.S. Its J-20 jet fighter, for example, bears a striking resemblance to the U.S.’s F-22 stealth fighter.  Insiders believe that China successfully obtained information about this technology by targeting defense contractors that worked for the U.S. and stealing information from them. There is also a possibility that China could develop its own artificial intelligence technology within the next 10 years and deploy it through its military. Of course, information to build this technology will likely be based on stolen information. In 1949, the People’s Republic of China was established, paving the way for the creation of dedicated intelligence services on both the Chinese side and the Americans. The goal was not just to pursue technological, military, and economic knowledge but to preserve and protect existing information. In 1996, the U.S. Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act. This act made the theft of trade secrets through espionage a federal crime, specifically when the theft is meant to damage a company or offer a foreign power an advantage. Before then, the overt effect of foreign espionage was considered just an occasional threat to which adjustments were made in terms of policies and procedures to help correct or block potential problems. In 2018, a program was implemented in an attempt to prosecute acts related to the theft of trade secrets and economic espionage. The program was known as the China Initiative, and it sought to utilize American resources to address threats presented by government agents deployed by China. Unfortunately, the program became infamous due to what many considered abusive prosecutions. It also paved the way for doubtful investigations, such as one that focused on research scientists who had Chinese ancestry and targeted them for minor issues. The program was meant to identify and prevent Chinese government spies from stealing proprietary technology or national secrets, but it deviated increasingly from this goal. By 2020, the China Initiative had undergone a long strategic review and was terminated formally. Espionage, plain and simple, is a means for one side to take advantage of the other, mainly through the surreptitious and dubious acquisition of knowledge, information, and skills. There is no doubt regarding the impact of Chinese espionage on the U.S. economy. Anything and everything that can be used, sold, traded, or bought to provide China with economic, military, and/or financial leverage is considered fair game. These may include software, material development information and techniques, manufacturing and production capabilities, trade secrets, and source codes. This information may be funneled through an agent or through covert means using cyber tools. IP theft alone is estimated to cost the American economy a minimum of $200 billion annually, mainly due to loss of income and profits. Intellectual property theft results in piracy and the production or manufacture of counterfeit goods. Statistics gathered by groups in the U.S., Canada, and Europe demonstrate that the majority of IP theft incidents could be traced to China just recently a Newsweek article about how Shima Capital’s Aurora Technology Acquisition Corp has been caught up in these nefarious espionage activities with Yida Gao at the helm. Just last month Cyber Reason discovered a “massive” hacking operation, apparently led by a hacking group believed to be backed by China, that had engaged in intellectual property (IP) theft and industrial espionage on three continents according to the Times of Israel. This points to a massive and highly organized operation that prevents authors and originators of designs, techniques, procedures, and processes to sell, trade, and profit from their work. Beyond the loss due to a serious decline in the sale of original products, there are other issues that lead to more problems. Labor, that is, jobs that could have employed skilled and knowledgeable people, will decrease and the quality of the products that will ultimately be produced as counterfeit goods will be suspect. In fact, many counterfeit goods have been shown to be extremely low-quality replicas. There are also safety issues that are associated with counterfeits. Illegally produced electronics, for example, pose a number of problems that may lead to premature damage to parts and components, increased risk of system failure, increased risk of data and system breach, premature replacement, or frequent need for repairs. Because they are significantly cheaper to produce, counterfeit products are more likely to flood the market, which will lead to excessive inventories, much of which will eventually bog down the nation’s landfills. The Future China entered into a cyber-hacking truce with the U.S. in 2015. However, many analysts believe this agreement will not have a long-term impact. It is still possible (and likely) that China would still use agents in different countries to continue hacking activities. The FBI had already warned about the threat posed by Chinese economic espionage and counterintelligence. Not only is the theft of information a threat to the nation\’s economic security, but it also presents a major concern to national security. Already, the U.S. estimates an economic loss of up to $600 billion annually. This figure represents a loss of income for the country every year. This type of economic loss has an even dire impact on the U.S. because it could lead to a trade imbalance, decline or even loss of industries (particularly those targeted by IP and fintech espionage), loss of jobs, and a serious decline in production capabilities. If the U.S. cannot put a stop to this threat, it stands to lose its global economic competitiveness. A more serious implication of Chinese espionage is, of course, its impact on national security, particularly through a decline in military technological advantage. Already, China has been shown to flex its muscles in certain territories in the South and East China Seas using military capabilities made possible by its theft of intellectual property. On top of that, China is putting a serious dent in the space exploration capabilities of the U.S. Given that the U.S., along with other countries in the world, relies on critical infrastructure safety, communications, and a stable economy to keep itself safe from outside threats, it is only a matter of time before China\’s questionable moves will eventually target the very core of the American government – its people"
2022.6.10,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/10/european-union-end-sales-new-diesel-gasoline-powered-vehicles-2035/,"In April 2021,Washington State approved a bill to ban the sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2030, making it the third state after California and Massachusetts to ban ICE vehicles.The state said the ban will drastically reduce the demand for fossil fuels as part of its effort to fight against climate change. It now appears that US allies on the other side of the pond are embarking on similar measures. This week, European Union (EU)lawmakers voted to ban the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans in the EU from 2035 as part of its ambitious green goals tocut carbon emissions from new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 100% in 2035. In a vote on Wednesday,339 MEPs in the European Parliament voted in favor of the plans, while 249 voted against the proposal. Only 24 MEPs abstained.The announcement comes just three months afterthebloc’s 27-member states also set a 2030 date toend their reliance on Russian energy.As we reported back in March, the EU currently gets 40% of its gas from Russia.  Commenting on the plan, Dutch MEP Jan Huitema, who is part of the Renew Europe Group, said. “I am thrilled that the European Parliament has backed an ambitious revision of the targets for 2030 and supported a 100% target for 2035, which is crucial to reach climate neutrality by 2050.” Meanwhile,the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association said it was “concerned that MEPs voted to set in stone a -100% CO2 target for 2035.” Oliver Zipse, who is the president of the ACEA and CEO of BMW, said his industry was “in the midst of a wide push for electric vehicles, with new models arriving steadily.” “But given the volatility and uncertainty we are experiencing globally day-by-day, any long-term regulation going beyond this decade is premature at this early stage,” Zipse added. “Instead, a transparent review is needed halfway in order to define post-2030 targets.” The EU has said it wants to be carbon neutral by 2050. In the medium term, it wants net greenhouse gas emissions to be cut by at least 55% by the year 2030, which the EU calls its “Fit for 55” plan. Meanwhile, as of 2020, the energy mix in the EU was mainly made up of five different sources: petroleum products (including crude oil) (35 %), natural gas (24 %), renewable energy (17 %), nuclear energy (13 %) and solid fossil fuels (12 %)."
2022.6.10,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/10/amazons-20-1-stock-split-bears-effect-defi-tokens-representing-amzn/,"There’s always a correlation between the stock market and cryptocurrency. For instance, as of May this year,the S&P 500 is down this year by 16%, and the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite is off by a bear-market 25%. During the same period, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, also slid 33%. But the correlation is not always a bad thing. Meanwhile, the correlation with the stock market is not just with digital currency but also with DeFi tokens. For example, in March,Amazon announced its first stock split since 1999 and the fourth since Amazon’s IPO in 1997. However, this new development from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a direct impact on the DeFi tokens representing the AMZN shares in the crypto market. The 20 for 1 stock split took effect on June 6th, splitting each existing share of AMZN into 20 individual units. At the current time, the shares trade at the price of $128. However, this split is not going to affect the business fundamentals but will only open more avenues for the ones looking to invest in the company. Before the split, Amazon shares were beyond the reach of most smaller investors.  While the stock split is a brilliant idea to onboard new investors, its effect on the DeFi tokens representing it is slightly different than one would expect. There are various projects that offer decentralized tokens representing real-world stocks. For instance, DeFiChain lets users mint and trade dAMZN, which closely follows the Amazon stock in DeFi to give you price exposure (but not ownership). The dAMZN, like all dTokens on DeFiChain, mimics the prices of real-world stock by tracking and reflecting a number of variable factors and using oracles to capture those feeds. The way this works is that anyone with a staked share of 50% DFI and 50% of any other assets’ combination can mint the assigned dToken. If investors don’t want to provide a mix of DFI and other assets, they can use DeFiChain’s decentralized stablecoin dUSD to mint a dToken. These dTokens aim to mimic the price action of the actual asset, providing an individual with the opportunity to invest and withdraw their favorite stock without the hassles of a traditional bank process. dAMZN To Break Up As Well The token will also be broken up into 20 tokens, just as the genuine Amazon stock will be. The owners of the dAMZN DeFi coin will receive 20 tokens for each and every dAMZN token that they hold, but their investment is not going to increase by 20 times. As DeFiChain will update the dAMZN price from the oracles, investors will hold the same amount of investment as they had before the split took place. The stock split itself was conducted in two stages. Following the cues of the stock market, DeFiChain locked all existing dAMZN tokens, and as the market reopened at the split-adjusted prices, DeFiChain began reflecting the price as well.  The reason why dAMZN and other DeFiChain tokens are noticing bullishness is that the process of traditional investment takes up too much of an individual’s time. DeFi tokens, on the other hand, require no such lengthy processing, making them much more efficient than TradeFi investment. Furthermore, geographical restrictions and trading limits have made it difficult for millions of investors to invest in their favorite US stocks. DeFiChain, with its dTokens, is helping such traders and investors gain price exposure to these assets from anywhere in the world. Apart from that, one can also buy a fractional piece of a token, for example – You could buy 1/10th of the dTSLA token, which in the spot market is almost impossible to find. But as one knows, the limits of the imagination is the sky, and DeFiChain knows how to take it up a notch further. Instead of having these dTokens sit idly in their wallet uselessly, DeFiChain allows the users to boost the yield with liquidity mining instead of only holding the stock to earn additional rewards. In conclusion, none of the dAMZN token holders have or will be affected drastically going forward since Amazon’s 20 for 1 split itself has been executed smoothly."

Musk’s instinct was right. He foresaw what most financial experts failed to see, including the US Treasury Secretary. Today,The US Labor Department (DOL) has come out with its latest inflation data and it’s not looking good. In fact, it’s getting worse. According to DOL, the consumer-price index increased 8.6% in May from the same month a year ago, marking its fastest pace since December 1981. U.S. inflation reached a new four-decade high of 8.6% in May https://t.co/iT5EkVYITo — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) June 10, 2022  The ripple effect of inflation is everywhere including in the tech sector.So far, at least 50 tech companies have either laid off their employees or plan to do so in the near future. As of June 7, there have been at least 17,000 employees laid off in mass job cuts in the U.S. tech sector so far this year, according to data layoff tracking data fromCrunchBase.More tech companies are also planning totrim their workforces to counter market challenges amid the global economic downturn. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted last week that she was wrong a year ago when she said she anticipated inflation would be “a small risk,” and “manageable.In an interview with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer,Yellen said: “I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take. As I mentioned, there have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I didn’t at the time … fully understand. But we recognize that now.” In just the last two decades, the US inflation rate has gone from $2.8% in 2001 to 8.6% in 2022. The highest jump was between 2021 and 2022 when inflation jumped by about 4%. Inflation in the United States: 2022: 8.6%2021: 4.7%2020: 1.2%2019: 1.8%2018: 2.4%2017: 2.1%2016: 1.3%2015: 0.1%2014: 1.6%2013: 1.5%2012: 2.1%2011: 3.2%2010: 1.6%2009: -0.4%2008: 3.8%2007: 2.8%2006: 3.2%2005: 3.4%2004: 2.7%2003: 2.3%2002: 1.6%2001: 2.8% — World of Statistics (@stats_feed) June 10, 2022  As you may recall late last year, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey warned about how “hyperinflation is going to change everything.” But economists and the so-called financial experts were so quick to dismiss what he said. Some even went as far as saying Jack is not a trained economist and didn’t know what he was talking about. Whether you agree with Jack or not, inflation is everywhere. We can see the effect of inflation on items we purchase at grocery stores, gas stations, and other places. Fast forward two weeks later,the Labor Department reported that prices for U.S. consumers jumped 6.2% from a year ago in October,as surging costs for food, gas, and housing left Americans grappling with the highest inflation rate since June 1982. The number is far higher than the +5.9% year over year (YoY) expected and accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY. At this rate,it won’t take long before the US turns into a banana republic. Here is how Jack responded to the news. “now try measuring using the pre-1980 methodology…,” Jack tweeted. now try measuring using the pre-1980 methodology… https://t.co/zJEBbg7zo5 — jack (@jack) November 10, 2021  ‘Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it,” Philosopher George Santayana said in his famous quote. Santayana’s quote perfectly sums up what the U.S. Federal Reserve has been doing for at least two years now.As we reported last year,40% of US dollars in existence today were printed in the last 12 months. History taught us that the best way to fight inflation is to stop printing money and increase the interest rate. But the Federal Reserve is in a precarious position–The Federal Reserve cannot afford to stop printing money and increase the interest rate due to fear of the stock market collapse. Just like drug addiction, bankers and politicians’ friends on Wall Street are addicted to free money.On the other hand, if the Federal Reserve keeps the interest rate the same, the inflation rate will continue to rise. Money printing has been going since 1971 when the US moved away from the gold standard. Then in 2020, the fed went on overdrive as it attempts to stimulate the economy due to the pandemic lockdown. The U.S. government issued stimulus checks to millions of employed Americans.Where did the money come from?The government had to borrow by selling its debt in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds and other types of securities. After the bonds are sold, the Federal Reserve gets to work and starts printing money. What is so ironic about this number is that just two years ago, Federal Reserve reported that40% of Americans don’t have $400 in the bank for emergency expenses, according to areportfrom ABC News.The 2019 Federal Reserve survey finds that almost 40% of American adults wouldn’t be able to cover a $400 emergency with cash, savings, or a credit card charge. Below is a video of the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell admitting the government simply flooded the system with money.  Money printing is nothing new. The Federal Reserve has been printing money since 1971 when the United States moved away from the gold standardand President Nixon ended the convertibility of U.S. dollars to gold. On Aug. 15, 1971, FormerPresident Richard Nixon said in a speech,“I have directed [Treasury] Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States.” In 1970, the average income was $9,400 and a new house was $23,400. Today, the cost of an average home is over $200,000.  So if history is any guide, what the Federal Reserve is doing now has been tried throughout history. As Federal Reserve continues to print trillions of dollars out of thin air with no productivity to back it up, at some point down the road, the world will finally lose faith in the US dollar as a global currency and conclude that it no longer makes sense to store their wealth in US dollars. Today, the Federal Reserve appears to be following in the footsteps of 1923 Germany’s Weimar Republic shortly after World War I. The country has often been cited as a classic of unending money printing. Between June 1921 and November 1923, the highest monthly inflation rate rose by over 30,000% in Weimar Germany. It all started around 1921 when Germany stopped backing its currency with gold and instead fired up its money-printing machine (similar to what the Federal Reserve is doing today) in order to finance the war. Then the money-printing machines continued printing after the war to help pay for reparations imposed upon Germany by the Allies. Interestingly, before World War I the German mark was trading at a value of roughly five to the dollar. Less than ten years later, it took one trillion German marks to buy a single dollar — which isn’t surprising considering that in 1923 the Reichsbank was issuing 120,000 trillion marks per day. In addition, before hyperinflation came to the Weimar Republic, the typical household spent 30% of their income on food and 30% on housing. By the time hyperinflation peaked in 1923, food expenses consumed 91% of German household income, while housing expenses fell to just 0.2%.  Zimbabwe is another country with hyperinflation.The African country ofZimbabwe experienced hyperinflation between 2006 and 2009. How bad was it? During the month of March 2007 the inflation rate there was 1730%. To put that in perspective, a $2 loaf of bread on March 1st would have cost $36.60 on the first day of April. Germany and Zimbabwe are not alone.Venezuela is the most recent example. However, there are other hyperinflation events that affected Argentina and Brazil in 1989, Russia in 1992, and Yugoslavia in 1994. In the video below, our friend Jake Tran takes us on a journey through the history of countries that have tried to print their way out of the economic crisis only to find themselves in deeper economic woes. Jake also explained that the reason why we haven’t seen hyperinflation is that the amount of money being printed is only one of the factors that contribute to inflation.To get major inflation, Jake explains, we need: 1.Industrial Output: How much “stuff” an economy makes 2.Employment:Too much employment leads to employers fighting over workers, which leads to higher wages, which leads to higher prices 3.The Money Supply:More money when an economy is producing the same amount or less stuff equals higher prices 4.Velocity of Money: If money is exchanging hands, and if so, how fast is it exchanging hands. Hats off to Jake for putting this video together. Enjoy!"
2022.6.10,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/10/introducing-rollux-syscoins-rollup-suite-ready-take-market-storm/,"As blockchain technology moves into the mainstream and serves as the underpinning technology for cryptocurrencies, one company that continues to push the boundary isSyscoin. They’vebeen innovating their blockchain architecture to offer the most capable platform with Bitcoin’s security, Ethereum’s flexibility, and Syscoin’s own scaling solutions. Syscoin is designed to be used by individuals from the unbanked to the elite, global enterprise, and even governments across the entire globe. Syscoin’s three-phase NEVM roadmap achieved completion of its first phase with the launch of our NEVM Layer 1 back in December. We now have big news as ‘Phase 2: Rollups’ quickly approaches integration. We are excited to reveal our own in-house Layer 2 rollup suite, named Rollux. Syscoin Rollux will offer projects running on the Syscoin Platform, either natively or across a bridge, with the scaling solutions they need to offer Web3 services. Picture speeds akin to Web2, but with the decentralization and economic feasibility made possible through the fusion of the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum, found only on Syscoin. Rollux is a complete Layer 2 solution, which will initially employ Optimistic rollups followed by ZK rollups once they realize maturity. Rollux is a white glove service whose Optimistic rollups will take full advantage of modular tech to offer unmatched Layer 2 capabilities upon its release. Jagdeep Sidhu, Lead Developer of Syscoin, had the following to say about these breakthroughs:There has recently been renewed interest in the security and scalability aspects of Optimistic rollups that have forced us to take another look at this technology even though we strongly believe in ZK-Rollups. One of these reasons is code-base maturity: Optimistic rollups are already more mature than ZK because a Zk-EVM is yet to be released and tested in the wild. We also believe that with direct EVM equivalence such as Nitro and Cannon technologies, we can unlock performance and scale that will advance the space and likely give a window of a few years before ZK-Rollups will be as efficient. The direct EVM equivalence in Nitro and Cannon will grant us a big step towards stateless Layer 2 systems, ushering in new advancements for scalability and security of Layer 2 systems. All of the Optimistic rollups today on Ethereum suffer from a lack of direct EVM equivalence, requiring teams to create workarounds rife with their own issues stemming from their inherent intricacies. However, with the imminent Cannon and Nitro updates address these issues by achieving equivalence, as well as a 50x performance improvement over existing rollups, which are already 100x more performant than Ethereum’s mainnet. We will be one of the first teams to launch with Bedrock/Cannon technology and once coupled with Syscoin’s PoDA, ours will be the most efficient, cost-effective, scalable and secure Layer 2 in existence. Thanks to Rollux, Syscoin’s NEVM will be the first to utilize Proof-of-Data Availability (PoDA) as pioneered by our own Jag Sidhu. After Ethereum, it will also be the one of the first to host Optimistic rollups, yet the only one to fallback on Bitcoin’s gold-standard PoW security whilst Ethereum 2.0 transitions towards PoS. Rollux remains agnostic regarding rollups and will integrate ZK rollups once ready for use. However, Optimistic rollups’ readiness makes it the perfect place to begin liftoff in the greatest leap forward in Layer 2 scaling solutions the crypto space has ever seen without sacrificing the decentralization, security, and affordability lying at the heart of Syscoin. The best part of the Rollux Suite for the projects who choose to utilize it is that it will be launched as a not-for-profit product of the Syscoin Foundation as we will forgo enforcing a token model so often seen in competitors, which only forces unnecessary fees and adds extra costs for users and friction to adoption. Since all network fees will be payable in SYS tokens and the network is run as a non-profit aligned with the best interests of the Syscoin ecosystem, we are creating the most efficient path towards mass adoption. We are laying the groundwork to reach that point by keeping fees cheap, using DAOSYS and our treasury to cover costs, and in so doing providing seamless integration for a scalable infrastructure that is open-source, free-to-use (permissionless), and self-sufficient once decentralized sequencer processes are integrated. Syscoin Rollux will be the bleeding edge of scaling tech for Solidity-based smart contracts. Rollux is the Layer 2 suite needed in the blockchain space to usher in the kind of maturity that comes with widespread adoption. It will be the boon needed to catapult projects running on the Syscoin Platform to the scale where boundaries are removed. Since our NEVM chain is EVM-compatible, it will also be the perfect tool to onboard projects from Ethereum that can all benefit from being secured by Bitcoin’s security at scale with the minuscule fees inherent to the Syscoin Platform. Founded in 2014, Syscoin is a decentralized and open-source project whose NEVM blockchain combines the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single coordinated modular platform. Syscoin is ushering in the next step in the evolution of blockchain technology, providing Bitcoin’s proven security and Ethereum’s Turing-complete programmability elevated to true scalability via rollups and other Layer 2 technologies."
2022.6.10,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/10/goldman-sachs-leads-100-million-investment-spanish-sustainable-fashion-startup-recover-now-valued-1-1-billion/,"Some have called it a fashion crime. The amount of waste in the fashion industry is unfathomable until you start peeling the surface.The $2.4 trillion fashion industry — with its short trend cycles and massive production rates — was named one of the most polluting sectors in 2021. According to the United Nations, of the 100 billion fashion items produced every year, 60% are thrown away within twelve months.The Environmental Audit Committee found that 15% of all clothing fabric is thrown out at the cutting stage before anything even ends up in stores. In the United States alone, 70% of the 13 million tons of clothing and footwear waste generated each year ends up in a landfill, according to another report by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Now, one startup wants to change by reducing waste in the fashion industry with sustainable textiles. Enter Recover, a Madrid, Spain-based sustainable fashion startup, andproducer of low-impact, high-quality recycled cotton fiber, and cotton fiber blends.Recover’s proprietary recycled cotton fiber reduces the carbon and water intensity of the apparel supply chain, addressing the apparel sector’s contribution to one of the world’s largest sources of environmental degradation. This week,Recover announced it has raised $100 million minority equity capital investment led by the Sustainable Investing business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management (Goldman Sachs), with participation from another majority shareholder STORY3 Capital Partners. The latest round now pushes Recover’s valuation to $1.1 billion. Since its inception,Recover has partnered with popular fashion retailers including Primark, and Zara, and provides them with recycled fiber.Recover says it plans to produce 350,000 metric tons of recycled cotton fiber and generate $1 billion in revenue by 2026. Recover will use the investment to accelerate its global expansion and production capacity, allowing more rapid adoption of sustainability initiatives by leading brands and retailers. Recover serves some of the largest and most recognizable retailers, brands, and vendors in the world, including, among others, Primark, Inditex, C&A, Revolve, and Lands’ End. According to another research firm Research and Markets, the ethical fashion market, which includes firms that emphasize environmental and labor practices, is expected to grow at a 9.7% compound annual growth rate to $10 billion in 2025. Recover’s proprietary recycled cotton fiber reduces the carbon and water intensity of the apparel supply chain, addressing the apparel sector’s contribution to one of the world’s largest sources of environmental degradation. Recover estimates that the new investment places Recover on a path to increase its production to over 350,000 metric tons of recycled cotton fiber per year by 2026, saving up to 5 trillion liters of water annually—equivalent to the drinking water consumed by over 4.5 billion people each year—and allowing for significant reductions of carbon emissions, energy and land use relative to the conventional cotton fiber, based on industry research.* “Goldman Sachs is committed to partnering with innovative businesses that help drive sustainability,” said Letitia Webster, Managing Director and Chief Sustainability Officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Division. “Recover is a leading disruptor in the apparel and textiles space with much-needed sustainable solutions grounded in materials science. We’re excited to invest in Recover’s growth to accelerate scaled production and the continued development of its technologies.” As part of the transaction, Webster will join the Board of Directors of Recover. “Recover is helping create a sustainable future by solving a colossal environmental issue and we are overjoyed to partner with Goldman Sachs to accelerate our growth,” said Alfredo Ferre, fourth-generation family steward and CEO of Recover. Ben Malka, Operating Partner at STORY3 Capital Partners and Executive Chairman of Recover, stated, “Recover has perfected the art and science of scaled production of sustainable recycled cotton fiber over more than 70 years across multiple generations of the Ferre family in Spain. Today, Recover offers a solution grounded in proprietary IP that provides cost-competitive, maximum-performance recycled cotton fiber for both rotor and ring-spinning applications.” The Recover brand is an important part of leading retailers’ and brands’ sustainability commitments and credentials, and a growing number of Recover’s customers are co-branding products with Recover to showcase that they have been produced with the company’s recycled cotton fiber. Operating in the $50 billion cotton market, Recover is a leading innovator and category-defining business that has experienced rapid growth. The company has opened new manufacturing hubs in Pakistan and Bangladesh, with additional hubs in Bangladesh and Vietnam due to open in the near term. “For change to happen at scale across the fashion industry, we need partnership and collaboration with innovators like Recover,” said Lynne Walker, Director of Primark Cares, Primark. “As we increase the use of Recover’s recycled cotton fiber in Primark products, this investment will enable us to meet our pledge to make more sustainable fashion affordable to millions of customers.”"
2022.6.11,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.6.11,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care.

Bitcoin Depot is the latest in a series of companies going public via SPAC. The announcement comes at a time when activities are beginning to cool off following regulatory pressure and poor performance. Sometimes called a blank-check company, SPAC is a shell company that has no operations but plans to go public with the intention of acquiring or merging with a company utilizing the proceeds of the SPAC’s initial public offering (IPO).So far this year, there are SPAC 74 deals, according to data from the SPAC analytics firm,SPACAnalytics.com. Assuming no redemptions, the combined company will be valued at $755 million, including debt, with an equity value of $885 million and up to $170 million in cash proceeds from the deal, according to a statement. “Today marks an important milestone for Bitcoin Depot,” said Brandon Mintz, CEO and Founder of Bitcoin Depot. “We are always looking to expand our reach so as many people as possible can access cryptocurrency to control their own money and conduct easier and simpler financial transactions. Since inception, we’ve expanded our BTM footprint across North America, signed strategic relationships with major retailers, and enhanced our services to provide convenient access to cryptocurrency as we aim to become a digital asset economy on-ramp destination for users to efficiently turn cash into crypto.

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol. Founded in 2020 byDavid Joao Vieira Carvaho, and Monica Oravcova,Naoris Protocol is the Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh for the hyper-connected world.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."

Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness.

Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

Now, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency suddenly fell to $26,151 as the report of the US latest inflation data ripples across the financial markets. As of press time, bitcoin was changing hands at around $25,989$25.832.20, down 2.72% over the past hour. Bitcoin was in free fall over the weekend as prices ranged from $28,000 to $26,000, with more than $100 billion wiped from the entire crypto market after U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen issued a stark warning againstcryptocurrency.  On Friday,The US Labor Department (DOL) has come out with its latest inflation data and it’s not looking good. In fact, it’s getting worse. According to DOL, the consumer-price index increased 8.6% in May from the same month a year ago, marking its fastest pace since December 1981. The fear of the Federal Reserve raising interest to slow the inflation has also sparked a sudden $100 billion crypto price crash, sending Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Cardano, XRP, Dogecoin, Polkadot, Tron, and Avalanche into further free fall. Bitcoin is not alone. Altcoins were also hit hard with ether falling to its lowest level in more than 14 months. The world’s second-largest crypto by market cap was recently trading at roughly $1,450, off more than 15% over the weekend. Ether had spent much of the past month at roughly $1,800. As we reported yesterday, the recent crypto crash is due to a series of macro events including surging inflation, tighter monetary policy, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused investors to shun risky assets."

This price increase is partly due to inflation and excessive money printing as investors move their cash into real assets like real estate, land, precious metals, and commodities. As home prices continue to rise, one Belgium-based tech startup is on a mission to reduce to cost of home building and help people with dreams of owning their own homes. Gablokwas founded with a single objective: to enable anyone to build their own construction project. Gablok also offers alternatives to traditional homes. Now, with the rising cost of new homes and increasing awareness to build environmentally friendly homes, Gablok is simplifying home construction and offering a simple and efficient kit house system. Unlike traditional home construction,Gablok takes a revolutionary approach to construction using insulated wooden frames andformwork blocks for self-build house projects. The Gablok concept is a series of insulated blocks, a customized floor system as well as insulated beams and lintels that will allow the building of the exterior and interior walls of a wooden house.The system has been validated by design offices in terms of stability, acoustics, and energy performance. Founded in 2019, Gablok sells a revolutionary construction method using an insulated wooden frame. In 2018, Gabriel Lakatos has patented a wooden home kit with the objective of simplifying construction and offering a simple and efficient way to build a house by yourself. The original idea behind Gablok was inspired by interlocking building block toys. In his early childhood, Gabriel was a fan of interlocking and construction games. He worked in the field of traditional construction for 25 years and developed an insulated wooden stacking block.After many months of research and testing, the home self-construction system was validated by engineering offices specialized in structural analysis, energy efficiency, and acoustic performance. What makes the Gablok concept is its insulated blocks, a customized floor system as well as insulated beams and lintels that will allow you to build the exterior and interior walls of your wooden house (self-construction structure). These items (detailed below) are required to assemble the shell of the isolated frame of your future construction. These are delivered directly to you on the construction site with your installation plan. This process makes it possible, among other things, to avoid the excess waste associated with on-site processing. After assembling the insulated formworks, all you have left is the construction of the roof (framework + roofing) and the exterior finishing of your home with the finish of your choice (plasters, bricks, cladding, etc).Inside your self-construction, you will start with the execution of various special techniques of your choice (thanks to the space left between the rafters) and then move on to the finishing (OSB + plasterboard, etc).Assembling the system is extremely fast and does not require any drying time. The self-build flat-pack kit for timber-frame houses provided by Gablok includes all the insulated structural components for your timber frame. In addition, Gablok allows you to build the interior load-bearing walls and the exterior structure of your home. For the structure, Gablok delivers the self-built insulated wooden blocks to your site on pallets, which saves you the waste associated with on-site processing. The construction is done quickly and your environment remains clean during the entire self-build process. When the structure of your timber-frame house is finished, all that is left to do is complete the roofing and general finishing (finishing, installing technical elements, etc.). Below is atime-lapse of quick house assembly with Gablok insulated building blocks."

With 1 in 6 adults currently working a gig position at least once a week, freelancing has become the new norm in a digitalized world. In fact, Covid-19’s push for wide-scale automation has quickly crept into the gig economy. From automated uber platforms to AI-powered freelancing software, connecting a freelancer to their next position has never been easier. As we step into a future of remote working, globalized skill pools, and ad-hoc hiring, let’s have a closer look at the impact technology will have on the gig economy of tomorrow. From artificial intelligence to machine learning, read on as we explore the future of a digitalized freelancing industry. 7.25 million adults are expected to have joined the gig economy by the end of 2022. In a post-Covid working world, many corporate employees have swapped their nine-to-five for a flexible ad-hoc future swimming with skill-based, well-paid opportunities. (Image Source: Stand Out CV) The question is, why has the gig economy boomed in a post-pandemic landscape? After a recent survey by Thrive My Way revealed that 20% of all workers are considering freelance positions in 2022, experts suggest that the gig economy’s rise in popularity is connected to a peak in post-Covid digitalization. In fact, on the back of AR/VR aids, remote working trends and a push for big data-based systems, four-fifths of hiring managers are now using digitally skilled freelancers to improve their mobile, web, and software development as they battle it out in an online playing field. In response, the demand for gig workers has boomed since 2020 after the e-commerce industry grew by a third. In an uncertain landscape, where startup competition is at an all-time high, many small business leaders have turned to ad-hoc hiring in order to improve business growth without the financial commitment of full-time employment. The latest stats show that a third of 18-34-year-olds returned back to work post-pandemic in the gig economy, and that number is expected to grow, especially as more tech and web-based positions become popular within the freelancing industry. As the freelance industry grows, so does the demand for technological evolution within the sector. As more gig workers take ad-hoc positions spread across the globe, digitalizing the connection process is vital in ensuring process efficiency. Not only can digitalized platforms aid the matchmaking process between gig workers and hiring managers, but artificial intelligence, in particular, has secured data transactions between freelancers and their employers, while also aiding upskilling, freelance targetted promotion, and automating macro tasks. In fact, 77% of Freelancers have claimed that AI-powered matchmaking platforms such as UpWork and Fiverr have made it easier to find job opportunities and connect with hiring managers. While there has been some contention from gig workers, as some skilled positions have been replaced by AI-automation, a large majority of the freelance industry has welcomed technological evolution in a post-Covid landscape and supported a future of efficient digital freelancing. Within the corporate industry, in particular, the use of artificial intelligence has risen significantly in the wake of Covid-19’s digital shift. (Image Source: Exploding Topics) As you can see above, the official AI market size is expected to grow from $93 billion in 2021 to a whopping $997 billion in 2028, with an average CAGR of 40%. As the uses of AI-powered tech continue to expand across a number of industries, let’s explore how it will change the gig economy in 2022. As the demands for freelancers grow rapidly within the corporate industry, both artificial intelligence and machine learning are making it easier for hiring managers to find the perfect match. AI has been known to improve the efficiency of skill hunting, as AI-powered systems work hard to aggregate data using a number of parameters, in order to create an automated shortlist of qualified talent within a wide pool of gig workers. Not only can this speed up the screening process, but AI-driven interfaces are also replacing traditional interviewing methods. From automated candidate question recording to automatically scheduling second-level interviews with qualified applicants, ad-hoc positions are filled quickly and efficiently. Speaking of efficiency, company leaders can use AI to measure and monitor gig work while automatically allocating freelance projects. AI is able to assist business owners in maintaining process efficiency and improving the value production within the gig economy. Using AI-powered platforms, many of the challenges once faced by hiring managers and HR professionals are quickly automated using digitalized work models. From balancing internal and external teams to automating project management and allocation, AI provides a small business with streamlined workflows, improving hybrid team organization and value production. Last but certainly not least, AI can also enhance upskilling within the gig economy. As tech evolves, so does skill-based demand within the freelance industry. The deployment of AI-driven education has improved the adoption of macro and micro-skills. Edtech platforms have allowed workers within the gig economy to receive training in a collaborative digital environment, while also providing useful tools to assist future projects. For example, many freelance content writers now use AI-powered aids such as Grammarly to speed up the copywriting process and ensure accuracy when completing projects. In a corporate landscape where big data is king, the use of AI-powered tools will continue to improve gig economy upskilling, freelance hiring and process efficiency as the working attitudes of tomorrow strive to keep evolving."
2022.6.13,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/13/ev-truck-tech-startup-electric-last-mile-files-bankruptcy-plans-liquidate/,"Electric Last Mile Solutions (ELMS), an EV-truck tech startup focused on defining a new era by transforming commercial fleets to drive e-mobility, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In an announcement on Sunday, ELMS said it’s planning to liquidate the companyafter a review of its products and commercialization plans. The announcement comes just three months after the beleagueredcompany came under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation in March. In February,ex-CEO James Taylor and ex-Chairman Jason Luo also resigned from the companyfollowing a board investigation that found the two had purchased heavily discounted shares of company stock pre-SPAC merger. The bad news didn’t stop there. According to the SEC filing, theMichigan-based maker of electric commercial vans also announced it was laying off 50 employees, about a quarter of its workforce, in order to “streamline its cost structure” for its core business, “The compound effect of these events, along with a pending SEC investigation initiated this year, made it extremely challenging to secure a new auditor and attract additional funding,” ELMS said in a statement on Sunday. “I’m very disappointed by this outcome because our ELMS team demonstrated incredible determination to get our electric vans ready to meet the critical need for clean, connected vehicles that reduce carbon emissions from ground transportation,” Ms. McIntyre said in a press release. “Unfortunately, there were too many obstacles for us to overcome in the short amount of time available to us. I could not be prouder of what our team has been able to accomplish under very challenging circumstances. This is a viable and essential technology, and I am confident that many of our talented employees will play a future role in this energy transition effort.” “For the past several months, the ELMS board and the new ELMS leadership team have worked nonstop to address legacy financial, governance and operational matters at the Company, and enormous progress was made, including towards vehicle certification” saidBrian Krzanich, ELMS Board Chair and former CEO of Intel. “Therefore, it’s extremely frustrating that we must take this route, but it was the only responsible next step for our shareholders, partners, creditors, and employees.” Founded in 2020 byJames Taylor and Jason Luo.ELMS is focused on defining a new era in which commercial vehicles run clean as connected and customized solutions that make our customers’ businesses more efficient and profitable. ELMS’ first vehicle, the Urban Delivery, is anticipated to be the first Class 1 commercial electric vehicle in the U.S. market."

2022.6.14,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/14/united-states-face-nuclear-reactor-shutdown-lose-chunk-power-grid-russia-cuts-off-enriched-uranium-supplies-reports/,"As of the end of 2021, the United States had 93 operating commercial nuclear reactors at 55 operational nuclear power plants in 28 states, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Unknown to most Americans, nearly half of the uranium used by these nuclear power plants is imported from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Since February 24 when Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States and its allies have been imposing punitive and devastating sanctions on Russia and its people. The sanctions include banning of Russia oil and gas imports to the United States. To date, however, Russia has not responded in kind. Unsuprisingly, the sanctions did not include uranium because the United States and its allies depend on them for their nuclear power plants.Now a new reportis warning about the consequence of Russia stopping the supply to the United States. Written by former Department of Energy Under Secretary Paul Dabbar and Columbia University energy researcher Matt Bowen and published in The Hill, the report warned that aRussian decision to halt the supply of enriched uranium to US power companies would take many of America’s nuclear reactors offline within a year, leading to a spike in electricity prices beyond the current price inflation, and potentially leaving some areas of the country unable to meet demand. Titled, “What’s at risk due to Russia’s nuclear power dominance?,” Drs. Dabbar and Bowen pointed out that nuclear power accounts for more than 20 percent of US electricity generation capacity. They also noted that although Russia only mines six percent of the world’s uranium, it controls some 40 percent of the global uranium conversion market, and 46 percent of total uranium enrichment capacity. “The more critical issue is the uranium fuel supply chain. Since Russia only mines 6 percent of the world’s uranium, it is relatively easy for countries and nuclear power plant owners to secure other global sources of uranium ore. However, Russia controls 40 percent of the global uranium conversion market, where uranium oxide “yellow cake” is converted into uranium hexafluoride — a gaseous form needed for the enrichment process. Natural uranium has a Uranium-235 isotope content of 0.7 percent, and the enrichment process increases the U-235 content to the 3-5 percent needed to run nuclear reactors. And Russia holds 46 percent of uranium enrichment capacity. The vast majority of the 439 reactors around the world require enriched uranium fuel, including all reactors in the U.S. fleet. And while each reactor has varying levels of dependency on Russian enrichment services, in total it is a material exposure.” United States is not the only vulnerable country. The report further notes that other countries are even more dependent on Russia for their nuclear power generation needs. The duo wrote that Finland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Finland, and Turkey reliant on Russian state nuclear giant Rosatom for everything from uranium mining, milling, conversion, enrichment, and fuel fabrication to the construction and servicing of state-of-the-art reactors.  It’s not all gloom and doom.Dabbar and Bowen urged Western leaders to “immediately consider their exposure to Russian nuclear exports and to take steps to reduce it or face another energy shock at the hands of [President Vladimir] Putin.”The United Stated has been dependent on Russian uranium imports since the early 1990s. They authors further urged the US government to provide assistance and incentives for US-based uranium conversion and enrichment facilities to rebuild the country’s dilapidated nuclear fuel supply chain. In a related White Paper, the authors also said that “Russia has exported more reactors in recent decades than any other major supplier. In 2021, there were 439 total nuclear power reactors in operation: 38 of them resided in Russia and 42 of them in operation in other countries were of the Russian VVER type (15 of which were in Ukraine). At the end of 2021, 15 Russian-designed reactors were under construction in other nations.” You can read the full commentary below."
2022.6.14,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/14/security-startup-zenity-set-make-low-codeno-code-better-ever/,"Low-code/no-code (LCNC) app development is expected to dominate enterprises. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 70 percent of the new applications created by organizations will employ LCNC technologies, triple its 25 percent level in 2020. There’s no doubt that it will be the major driver of citizen development, as more employees take part in building business apps without the need to learn how to code. Bespoke business apps are the ideal option for businesses with specific needs. Third-party software rarely addresses the unique functional requirements of organizations. There are instances when apps have the features an organization requires, but these apps also have many other unnecessary functions that create unwanted complexities and lengthy steps to go to the specific functions employees want to use. With LCNC app development platforms, almost anyone can become an app developer without the need to learn to use programming languages. The problem is that these platforms do not guarantee security and proper app governance. Zenity emerges as the pioneering solution to this lack of suitable app governance and security. It provides a simple and convenient way to spot policy violations, unveil shadow IT business apps, drive automatic remediation processes, and detect anomalous application behavior. The brainchild of two online entrepreneurs and experienced IT security experts, Zenity was founded in 2021 by CEO Ben Kliger and CTO Michael Bargury in response to the rise of low-code/no-code technology for pro and citizen developers. Kliger and Bargury established the startup after noticing how existing apps and app development security solutions were still too focused on traditional app development and had minimal-to-no innovations to meet LCNC needs. LCNC apps can be likened to workers secretly outsourced by a well-intentioned department head because they get the job done at a lower cost. The supervisors and general manager are unaware of the outsourcing, so they do not take extra precautions with regard to the unaccounted-for workers. If these outsourced workers wittingly or unwittingly commit mistakes that lead to unwanted consequences, it will be difficult for the management to trace the source and provide the appropriate solution. It is extremely difficult to solve a problem that originates from or is brought about by an invisible source. In cybersecurity, this invisible or hidden potential source of security problems is called shadow IT. This is what Zenity is trying to address with its discover-mitigate-govern-protect approach in securing low-code/no-code applications. Discover – Zenity facilitates the inventorying of all LCNC apps, app creators, and data across different platforms. This cross-platform visibility ensures that there are no data leaks, suspicious activities, and vulnerabilities that can be attributed to low-code apps. The data exchanged between on-prem endpoints or SaaS apps is also monitored to prevent threats from breaching cyber defenses and actually inflicting damage. After all apps are discovered or accounted for, Zenity shows charts of security policy violation statuses, risk statuses, risky resources, and top policy violations. Mitigate – The mitigation step is about reducing the risk or attack surfaces by continuously conducting risk evaluations for all low-code/no-code apps and their components. Here, the platform identifies configuration drifts, vulnerabilities in third-party app components, and unsafe app usage. Zenity raises alerts for possible environment mismatch, for example. It then shows the possible actions that can be undertaken, the details of the security policy violation, and a summary of the remediation steps that will be undertaken. Govern – Zenity plays an important role in proper app governance. It helps organizations in designing and implementing suitable governance policies that are most suitable to the needs and unique circumstances of an enterprise. It also supports the configuration of security controls to automate responses to threats depending on the environment and app usage. With proper app governance, organizations can get rid of the risks without disrupting business operations. Protect – Zenity is designed to meticulously scan low-code/no-code apps for possible malicious activity. The platform is useful in detecting and preventing supply chain attacks, data leakage, and the deceptive behavior of malware as it tries to infect systems. Zenity shows alerts for various risks, including anomalous data movements. These alerts come with urgency indicators, threat descriptions, and other significant details that can help in addressing security issues. Zenity’s low-code security research reveals seven major risks and threats that are resolved by using the platform. These problems coincide with what is listed in the OWASP Low-Code/No-Code Security Risks. Security and governance may sound humdrum, but they are crucial for the success of LCNC technology. Citizen development has progressed considerably over the years, but it’s only recently that the idea of adequately secure and well-governed self-built apps has been given the attention it deserves. The founders of Zenity take pride in offering a trailblazing solution, highlighting that “Zenity is the first and only security governance solution for low-code/no-code applications, and doesn’t have direct competition.” Many cybersecurity products were launched over the past few years, but they have focused on SaaS security, protection for SaaS automation, and defense against SaaS third-party risks. “Such companies might also protect SaaS low-code/no-code automation platforms from a DLP perspective, but no company offers a holistic security governance solution for any kind of low-code/no-code platform, be it LCAP, workflow automation, iPaaaS or RPA,” Zenity’s founders say. The security and governance advantage that Zenity brings to LCNC technology is more profound than the simplistic or straightforward kind of security offered by conventional app security solutions. It provides governance and security for all apps created with Citizen Automation and Development Platforms (CADP) and Low-Code Application Platforms (LCAP). It covers a wide range of situations where low-code/no-code is put to use. Furthermore, it helps secure interconnected business apps as well as hyper-automation (enabled by these LCNC apps) to support organizations as they make the most out of citizen development. Zenity provides protection for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) bots and virtual agents. It can account for all bots or virtual agents built with an RPA platform and spot risky practices in the use of credentials and identities. This allows organizations to securely take advantage of bots in their operations to free human resources for other more important tasks. Moreover, Zenity brings governance and security to Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) as well as to Intelligent Business Process Management Systems (iBPMS). With these, organizations are assured that the sensitive data exchanged between SaaS apps and on-prem endpoints is safe. Also, it enables developers to automate complex business workflows and stimulate business growth. Zenity is making low-code/no-code better than ever, mainly by ascertaining that the resulting interconnected applications are secure and do not have vulnerabilities that can be taken advantage of by cybercriminals. It provides cross-platform visibility and takes low-code/no-code apps out of shadow IT to allow organizations to build their security posture without missing anything. Additionally, Zenity achieves all of these at minimal costs. As a SaaS solution, users only pay whenever they use the platform. There is no hefty flat fee that is essentially wasted when the solution is only used a few times. Organizations also do not need to significantly change the way they build apps with LCNC platforms. Zenity is utilized as a supplemental solution and does not entail costly upfront costs, multiple on-prem software installations, and training costs before deployment."

According to the announcement, the cut represents18% of its total workforce. Coinbase has been under a lot of pressure in recent months. Just last month,Coinbase warns its users could lose their crypto holdings if the company goes bankrupt.Coinbase warned its customers their crypto holdings could be viewed as general unsecured assets during the bankruptcy proceedings. In a blog post on Tuesday, Coinbase CEOBrian Armstrong said,“We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period.” In his email to Coinbase employees, Armstrong also pointed to a possible recession, and the need to manage the company’s burn rate and increase efficiency. He added that Coinbase grew “too quickly” during the bull market. “We appear to be entering a recession after a 10+ year economic boom. A recession could lead to another crypto winter, and could last for an extended period,” Armstrong said in the email, adding that past crypto winters have resulted in a significant decline in trading activity. “While it’s hard to predict the economy or the markets, we always plan for the worst so we can operate the business through any environment.” Without further elaboration on which departments would be impacted, Armstrong said employees would receive an email “in the next hour” from HR informing them if they had been affected by the layoff. A few weeks ago,Coinbase said it would extend a hiring freeze and rescind a number of accepted offers in order to deal with current macroeconomic conditions. The company also disclosed in a filing on Tuesday that it expects to incur about $40 million to $45 million in total restructuring expenses, substantially related to employee severance and other termination benefits. “On June 14, 2022, Coinbase Global, Inc.

To date,the NFT market has now surpassed $20 billion. In 2021 alone, NFT collectors and traders spent $22 billion on NFTs, up from $100 million in 2020, according to the Guardian.The demand for NFTs continues to soar as tech heavyweights like Visa, celebrities, and other popular figures joined the NFT revolution. Today, the legendary South African cricketer, AB de Villiers announced his partnership with Myria, a blockchain gaming company, to build his mobile-based cricket game on Myria’s infrastructure. This makes it the first celebrity-backed cricket blockchain game that integrates blockchain play-and-earn models and additional features such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The AB de Villiers-backed game will be exclusively available to mobile users, mirroring the thrill of playing cricket on the field. With over 2.5 billion fans of cricket worldwide, the game aims to introduce millions of them to blockchain gaming. The partnership between AB de Villiers and Myria will build a brand and community around the game, enabling one of the world’s largest and most passionate sports communities to leverage their love and understanding of cricket to excel and have fun in the game. “It’s always been about cricket. It’s always been about entertaining the crowds. I’m constantly looking for ways to change the game and building my blockchain-enabled cricket game on the Myria platform is the next step for me.” said AB de Villiers. Founded in 2021, Myria offers a comprehensive blockchain gaming development platform that aims to bring the highest quality, most exciting, and largest range of blockchain games to life. The gaming company develops its own free-to-play AAA titles while providing a full-stack solution for partner studios to build their games in the Myria ecosystem. This opens up endless potential for gaming developers, a statement from the team read. “It’s clear that we’ve entered a new era for gaming,” said Brendan Duhamel, Myria’s Head of Blockchain. “Cricket icon and innovator, AB de Villiers, leads the cricket industry to move the enthusiasm people have for cricket into the digital realm. Cricket and crypto share the privilege of gathering communities that are incredibly energized and passionate. AB has placed his trust in Myria’s platform to bring his blockchain-enabled cricket game to life and together we’ll usher in a future of empowered gamers and communities.” Named the GOAT in cricket, or the greatest batsman of all time by the IPL, AB de Villiers will bring his millions of fans to try out blockchain gaming. In Asia, Australia, and South Africa, cricket is a religion, not your ordinary sport. The level of engagement and fanfare in this sporting community is extraordinary and the blockchain game will be even more so given AB de Villier’s legendary status in the cricket world. While the game is a play-and-earn model, the team believes this is not the only reason players should look forward to playing the game. The cricket game by Myria and AB de Villiers aims to bring fun to blockchain gaming, where earning is not the main reason to play (unlike many blockchain games). The game aims to make players genuinely excited to play and create a culture around the game while doing so. “The main thing is that there is no compromise,” AB de Villiers stated when speaking on what the game entails. “My cricket game will be fun and exciting just like a match on the field, but it will also be equitable and empower digital asset ownership. Myria shares my commitment and together we will bring new cricket experiences to my fans.” The game is expected to launch in the coming year, with players able to download it for free on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store from Q2 2023. Founded in 2021 by Davin Potts, Rey Flemings, and Stephen Handley, Myria is the first Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution built for gaming. With the mission of enabling more people to build, experience, and enjoy the benefits of blockchain and the metaverse, Myria is building a suite of developer tools including easy-to-use API integrations and SDKs for developers to easily harness Myria’s platform infrastructure to unlock the potential of blockchain. This suite of infrastructure will also underpin the expansive blockchain gaming ecosystem being developed by their gaming division, Myria Studios, which has a variety of free-to-play AAA blockchain games in the pipeline. Born 17 February 1984, Abraham Benjamin de Villiers is a former South African international cricketer. AB de Villiers was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career and was one of the five Wisden cricketers of the decade at the end of 2019. He is regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in the history of the sport. AB de Villiers retired in 2021 and has recently started to work on various projects including his cricket game, built on Myria’s Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution."
2022.6.14,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/14/romanias-ici-bucharest-taps-elrond-network-build-web3-decentralized-domains-institutional-nft-marketplace/,"A little over a year ago, blockchain startup Elrond became the first carbon-negative European blockchainby offsetting more CO2 than its network accounts for.Unlike other blockchain platforms, what makes this a monumental accomplishment is that every Maiar transaction, NFT or DeFi product on the Elrond network will have a positive impact on the environment. The achievement opens a new wave of sustainable innovation in line with the European Climate Policy. Since then,Elrond has become a preferred platform for a new generation of creators and innovators to seed the foundations of a digital network of trust. Today,Romania’s National Institute for Research and Development In Informatics – ICI Bucharest (ICI) announces that work is underway for building an institutional NFT marketplace and a decentralized Domain Name System (DNS/TLD) based on the highly scalable and carbon-negative Elrond Network blockchain. Both initiatives are the first of their kind in the European Union and are being developed in parallel by experts from Romania’s ICI Bucharest in collaboration with Elrond Network developers. “The goal is to evolve the collaboration between citizens and institutions using a modern digital framework. Web3 technologies can transform public administration and help its institutions and processes leap forward in terms of efficiency and speed while decreasing costs, overhead, and excessive bureaucratic activities” said Adrian Victor Vevera, General Director of ICI Bucharest. The National System for Issuers and Digital Assets will be the first of its kind in Romania and likely in the European Union. It is being created as a public-institutional marketplace for digital assets that will use blockchain-based Decentralized Identity and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) technology to digitize, access, transfer and store official documents, property deeds, or various certificates. In their cryptographically secured format, the documents will retain their validity and utility, while circulating at higher speeds, reducing costs and increased security. This standardized format will simplify the integration with new systems and act as a facilitator for the full digital transformation of public administration and governance. ICI is also looking to leverage the scalable Elrond Network to build a decentralized Domain Name System (DNS) and Top-Level Domains (TLD). By deploying this essential layer to digital communication on top of Elrond’s 3200 validators network, ICI is looking to strengthen the security and availability of critical public resources by overcoming the limitations of the legacy DNS and TLD systems, as well as the potential existing vulnerabilities of the actual centralized architecture. “The intersection of governance and technology creates a universe of opportunities for advancing society. It is the right time to take the initiative along with our partners from ICI and embed Elrond Web3 innovations into the next generation of national and institutional frameworks,” said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond Network CEO. Founded in 1970,ICI Bucharest is the most important institute in the field of Research, Development, and Innovation in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Romania, supervising the Romanian National Register for Domain Names – RoTLD – the official authority that manages the .RO Top Level Domains by creating, implementing, and maintaining the software systems, databases, and infrastructure necessary for the .ro to be existent on the Internet. The long activity of ICI Bucharest is signified by the realization of Research and Development projects in the field of IT&C, supporting the development of the national information society. ICI Bucharest’s mission is to aggregate excellence in research and innovation, for the development of the knowledge-based economy in Romania, and for better integration in the European and international research space. Elrond is a new blockchain architecture, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy."
2022.6.15,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/15/bill-gates-says-cryptos-nfts-100-based-greater-fool-theory/,"Love him or hate him, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has come out with a statementthat most hard-working Americans and investors will agree on–cryptocurrency is based on The Greater Fool Theory, similar to what other respected investors have been saying for years. Speaking at a TechCrunch talk on climate change on Tuesday, the 66-year-old billionaire said he thinks cryptocurrencies and NFTs are “100%” based on the greater fool theory. Gates’ view is similarto legendarybillionaireinvestor Warren Buffet. In April, Buffet said in aninterviewthat he wouldn’t take bitcoins if they were offered to him at $25 per bitcoin. Buffet added that bitcoin has no intrinsic value and thatcryptocurrency “doesn’t produce anything.” Gates described the crypto and NFT phenomenon as something that’s “100% based on greater fool theory,” referring to the idea thatduring a market bubble, one can make money by buying overvalued assets and selling them for a proﬁt later because it will always be possible to ﬁnd someone (The Greater Fool) who is willing to pay a higher price.  Gates even joked that “expensive digital images of monkeys” would “improve the world immensely,” referring to the much-hyped Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. NFTs are tokens that can’t be exchanged for one another. They’re often touted as a way to prove ownership of digital assets like art or sports collectibles. “I’m used to asset classes … like a farm where they have output, or like a company where they make products,” Gates said. As for crypto, “I’m not involved in that,” Gates added. “I’m not long or short any of those things.” Gates is not alone. Late last year,Gravel Institute did a documentary on Bitcoin, calling it ‘a scam’ similar to a Ponzi scheme. In the video narrated by Doug Henwood, awriter, economist, and author ofWall Street, Henwoodlikened Bitcoin to an Italian swindler and con artist namedCharles Ponzi. Today, Ponzi has become synonymous with an investment scam where investors are promised substantial returns.Operators of the Ponzi scheme keep their fraud going by luring new clients. Once new investors put their money into the scheme, the money is then collected and used to pay the original investors as “returns.” Henwood describes Bitcoin as a digital token with no physical or government backing, that’s run by a global decentralized network of computers,Henwood said all of the stuff you hear about “peer-to-peer technology” and “the blockchain” reallyonly explains how Bitcoin works like a currency. “But despite the name, Bitcoin is not really used much as a currency at all.When people buy Bitcoin, they rarely use it to buy goods and services.They’re really buying access to a Ponzi scheme. Only 1.3 percent of Bitcoin’s economic activity is in merchant transactions.The rest is speculation – people buying it just because they think it will go up.” Meanwhile, the price of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency fell as low as $20,111 in early trading today before bouncing back up later in the afternoon. Below is Doug Henwood’s video about bitcoin truth."

For example,real estate investors, managers, lenders, borrowers, and brokers often lack both the data they need to invest with confidence and the workflow automation capabilities they need to get deals done fast. EnterAltrio, a Toronto, Canada-based PropTech startup that’s solving a major problem for the institutionally managed commercial real estate market. Altrio addresses the data issues through Origin, its data-driven cloud-based deal management platform. Origin is an easy-to-use solution that provides a single source of truth about an organization’s investment pipeline, owned assets, and proprietary market knowledge. Origin reduces the time required to perform administrative tasks, keeps team members coordinated, and streamlines the flow of information across a company’s global operations. To further grow its platform, Altrio announced today it has raised $6.2 million (CAD$8 million) in Series A funding to digitize global real estate capital markets. The round was led by Whitecap Venture Partners with participation from Mantella Venture Partners, Alate Partners, and Colliers.In conjunction with the funding, Altrio said that Shayn Diamond, partner at Whitecap Venture Partners, will join its board of directors. The companywill also use the funding proceeds to double its headcount from 26 today to more than 50 by the end of 2022 and to accelerate the development of its product roadmap. In August 2021, Altrio raised a Seed funding round led by N49P and QuadReal Property Group. Since then, the company has achieved a 6X increase in revenue and a 7X increase in customers. Founded in 2020 byreal estate veteransRaj Singh andJon Simpson,Altrio’s mission is to help real estate investors and managers achieve their goals and enjoy their work by creating software and services that make their jobs easier, the company said on its website. Altrio’s Origin deal management solution is used by customers with combined assets under management of more than $1 trillion, including two of the world’s three largest real estate investors. Origin’s users manage equity and debt transactions in every sector, across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. “Companies that invest in real estate are not satisfied with traditional deal management platforms that focus exclusively on deal tracking. So, they have enthusiastically embraced our more data-driven approach to deal management, which enables them to leverage their proprietary information to invest with greater conviction and move quickly on competitive deals,” CEO Singh said. Singh also added,“In addition to the significant growth we have seen in our customer base, the ability to secure this investment in just three months at a time when market conditions are particularly challenging, is a testament to the value that Origin delivers to real estate investors.” “Altrio’s solution is unique in the market in that it combines process automation with robust data management. This ensures that real estate investors have a single solution to manage their entire investment process and keep track of everything needed to get a deal done, from a first look to final close,” says Shayn Diamond, partner at Whitecap Venture Partners. “Because of the huge benefits that Origin delivers, Altrio has generated significant traction with leading global real estate investors that are rapidly adopting its platform.”"
2022.6.15,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/15/traditional-businesses-entering-crypto-theyre-big-blockchain/,"Crypto businesses inhabit a world of blockchain, tokens, DAOs, and community governance, while traditional businesses occupy a sphere free of such jargon and onchain phenomena. And never the twain shall meet…only that’s no longer correct. The gulf between web2 and 3, old and new, onchain and never-been-on-any-chain has narrowed to the point at which any company can now flit between the two on a whim. And increasingly, traditional businesses are electing to do just that, making the transition to the cryptosphere with surprising ease. Why might a business that has existed for decades without blockchain suddenly start simping over one…and what might such crypto-friendly businesses find when they arrive on the other side? Let’s dive in and find out. There are three primary ways why businesses are entering crypto – or toying with the prospect at least: These three goals can be achieved by utilizing the following solutions respectively: While an over-simplification, this model makes it easy to understand the incentives that are luring traditional companies into the crypto sector. Now let’s consider a real-world example of each model in turn. Once derided as little more than tradable JPEGs, NFTs have come of age and are now being used to build highly engaged and passionate communities. NFTs’ exclusivity, inclusiveness, and opportunity for fostering brand loyalty has not been lost on traditional companies. The boldest of these have wasted no time in launching limited edition NFT collections and making tentative forays into that digital analog, the metaverse. In late 2021, Adidas partnered with Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club, whose NFTs have become status symbols with celebs such as Snoop Dogg and Eminem. An Adidas Originals virtual sneaker collection got the ball rolling, and the sports giant is also taking a place in Otherside, the metaverse Yuga Labs is building with Animoca. In the metaverse, groups of like-minded people will hang out, socialize, work, and recreate while represented as digital avatars. It stands to reason they’ll want to clad their virtual selves in the hippest threads – sneakers included. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Adidas is joining the likes of Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci in creating virtual accessories for the metaverse generation. Suppose you’re a traditional business that’s created a mobile application. You have a core group of users but you wish to increase uptake and stimulate positive behaviors from existing users that will improve the service for everyone. How do you go about it? Well, one approach is to incorporate a crypto component that will support tokenization. Introduce a native token and you can reward app users commensurate with their contributions. Now there’s an incentive structure in place that can fairly remunerate users and onboard new ones.  SeaCoast wasn’t always a crypto company, but after seeing the potential in blockchain and tokenization, they took the plunge. The result is a trio of augmented reality (AR) apps that support coastal exploration and maritime navigation. PortView helps sailors locate the entrance to ports and harbors using augmented reality to overlay navigational information. PaperBoat provides information on marina berths including pricing. And ShoreView provides holidaymakers with up-to-date information on coastal attractions and points of interest. While the clever utilization of augmented reality is what makes SeaCoast’s apps so powerful, the real magic lies in the use of tokenization to reward user-curated content. Locals who share real-time information on the state of the coast will earn $COAST tokens, which will power a thriving in-app economy centered around the sea. All traditional businesses that enter crypto are using blockchain in some capacity since it is the conduit that routes token, asset, and NFT transfers alike. Some enterprises have no interest in the aforementioned use cases, however, and are only in it for the blockchain itself. To them, blockchain solves a very specific problem – that of trust – in a way that conventional databases cannot. BNP Paribas and JPMorgan are participating in a blockchain-based repo market that enables banks to provision short-term lending of US government bonds as collateral while retaining ownership of the bonds themselves. As the FT explains, “Details such as the length of the loan and settlement time are governed by a smart contract, which ensures that the cash is in the borrower’s account and that collateral locked up against loans is released at the end of the deal.” Crypto isn’t a cure-all that can revive the fortunes of flagging businesses and provide new revenue streams on tap. Rather, it’s a tool that, when wielded intelligently, can open up new capabilities for customer engagement, incentivization, and growth."

It was just like yesterday when Cybersecurity startup GreyNoise Intelligence raised its seed funding to help security teams focus on real security threats. As we reported back then, GreyNoise closed a $600K seed financing to filter out the background noise consisting largely of false positives and allow security teams to streamline and prioritize threat analysis. Since then, the company has grown exponentially. Today, the Washington, DC-basedGreyNoise Intelligence announced it has raised a $15 million in Series A funding led by Radian Capital, bringing its total funding to date to $21 million. With this funding, GreyNoise will accelerate the development and distribution of its unique threat intelligence data solution, which helps security teams waste less time on irrelevant or harmless activity, and spend more time focused on targeted and emerging threats. Every day, organizations around the world are faced with millions of security alerts. Separating noise from the signals and knowing the difference between benign and malicious internet scans can save the company time and money. GreyNoise helps enterprises identify Internet background noise caused by benign sources that inflate the volume of security alerts. GreyNoise Intelligence was founded in 2017 by CEO Andrew Morris with the goal of analyzing Internet background noise to remove pointless security alerts, find compromised devices and identify emerging threats. After initially releasing a free API to access the collected data, which quickly gained thousands of followers, GreyNoise deployed an enterprise service in late 2018.GreyNoise analyzes Internet background noise, removes pointless security alerts, finds compromised devices, or identifies emerging threats. Commenting on the funding, GreyNoise founder and CEOAndrew Morris explains:“Ask any SOC analyst and they will tell you that existing network security products aren’t cutting it. Security tools generate thousands of alerts from harmless events that need to be investigated, and alert fatigue causes missed threats and productivity issues. Our research and customer feedback have demonstrated that this is a largely solvable problem.” Morris added:“To address these issues, GreyNoise separates irrelevant internet noise from emerging threats. This enables security teams to quickly eliminate noisy security alerts from the SOC, identify and block mass exploit attacks, hunt for compromised systems, and prioritize patching. We offer security teams a better way to stay ahead of large opportunistic attacks such as Log4J.” Using a global network of passive sensors, GreyNoise collects, analyzes, and labels data on IPs that scan and attack the internet, saturating security tools with noise. GreyNoise data provides security teams with an early warning system for mass exploitation attacks on the internet, real-time IP block lists they can use to defend themselves, and context to quickly eliminate noisy alerts. “We’re thrilled to invest and partner with GreyNoise, a company that has taken an innovative approach to tackling the enormous issue of mass exploitation attacks and internet noise,” said Dave Sack, Principal, Radian Capital. “GreyNoise has created a category-defining new product that helps security teams to sort out irrelevant alerts and focus their time and energy on targeted and emerging threats. With applicability to almost any security organization, the market for this solution is enormous and growing quickly.” GreyNoise is used by Global 2000 enterprises, governments, top security vendors and tens of thousands of threat researchers, including industry leaders such as Airbus, CenturyLink, The Intercontinental Exchange, and multiple US and NATO Defense and Intelligence agencies. It is particularly valuable for enterprises that have a Security Operations Center and runs a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or Security Operations Analytics and Reporting (SOAR) platform. GreyNoise is also committed to supporting the broader security community via its free Community plan, which currently serves security analysts at over 10,000 organizations. In 2022, GreyNoise ranked #2 on The Cyber Top 20 list for “Cyber Alert Reduction” and was recognized by the Cybersecurity Excellence Awards as one of the industry’s “Best Cyber Security Startups.”"

This week,Apple has secured a historic long-term rights deal to stream Major League Soccer (MLS) as part of its growing ambitions to become a sports broadcaster. According to the announcement, the deal is reportedly worth at least $250 million annually, or $2.5 billion over ten years. That’s 2.8 times more than the $90 million MLS deal we reported back in March. As part of the agreement, “the Apple TV app will be the exclusive destination to watch every single live MLS match beginning in 2023.” The partnership is a historic first for a major professional sports league and will allow fans around the world to watch all MLS, Leagues Cup,1 and select MLS NEXT Pro and MLS NEXT matches in one place — without any local broadcast blackouts or the need for a traditional pay TV bundle, Apple said in a statement. From early 2023 through 2032, fans can get every live MLS match by subscribing to a new MLS streaming service, available exclusively through the Apple TV app. In addition to all of the match content, the service will provide fans a new weekly live match whip-around show so they never miss an exciting goal or save, and also game replays, highlights, analysis, and other original programming. In addition, Apple also said that theMLS live and on-demand content on the Apple TV app will be available to anyone with internet access across all devices where the app can be found, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV 4K, and Apple TV HD; Samsung, LG, Panasonic, Sony, TCL, VIZIO, and other smart TVs; Amazon Fire TV and Roku devices; PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles; Chromecast with Google TV; and Comcast Xfinity. “For the first time in the history of sports, fans will be able to access everything from a major professional sports league in one place,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “It’s a dream come true for MLS fans, soccer fans, and anyone who loves sports. No fragmentation, no frustration — just the flexibility to sign up for one convenient service that gives you everything MLS, anywhere, and anytime you want to watch. We can’t wait to make it easy for even more people to fall in love with MLS and root for their favorite club.” Commenting on the deal,MLS Commissioner Don Garber told SBJ,“What’s different here is traditionally media companies pay rights fees, and you sell ads. This is a partnership. And that partnership’s core is a subscription business that we’re going to build together, and we’re going to get a guarantee against the revenues that will be achieved on the subscription business. Then, we go over those guarantees, we’ll have the opportunity to make more money, which is really unique in sports media.” With this new deal, Apple is poised to dominate the global sports streaming market which was valued at over $18 billion, as of 2020. The sports streaming industry is alsoprojected to reach $87,338.11 Million by 2028, according todatafrom research firm VerifiedMarketResearch."

2022.6.15,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/15/decentralized-crowdfunding-platform-earthfund-launches-dao-service-system-simplify-funding-world-changing-causes/,"Blockchain has only been around for only a few years but the technology has had far-reaching impacts affecting billions of people around the world. Blockchain is also the very foundation of Web3 and the technology is changing all the facets of our lives including the way we use the internet altogether. Apart from serving as the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, blockchain has also been in many other industries including health, finance, banking, environment. Unlike other technologies before it, what makes blockchain so appealing is the idea of decentralization which empower its users to create projects that advocate social good. An example of this EarthFund, a decentralized platform thatcrowdfunds for the greater good directly on the blockchain. Founded a few months ago,the team atEarthFund is building a first-of-its-kind, DAO-controlled crowdfunding platform for projects and ideas that can build a better tomorrow.They are changing the world by decentralizing crowdfunding and helping tackle humanity’s biggest problems. Today,EarthFundlaunches its “DAO-as-a-Service” system to allow anyone to set up funding DAOs for causes they care about andsimplify funding for world-changing causes. WithEarthFund DAO, you can join communities dedicated to causes you’re passionate about, crowdfund your world-changing treasury, and vote for which projects get the money they need to make an impact, the startup says on its website. Following stories such as ConstitutionDAO or UkraineDAO, the concept of creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization to fund real-world causes has become mainstream. Previous attempts, while perhaps situational and ultimately not that impactful, were a great showcase of the power of incentives and the force crypto can play for good. Unfortunately, setting up a funding DAO was strictly a task for experienced Solidity developers, a class of programmers in extremely short supply. Regular companies and individuals were unable to set up the infrastructure required for a funding DAO, which limited the potential impact of the technology. With EarthFund, the situation changes completely. Everyone can use its intuitive UI to set up their funding DAO for a cause they care about, attract funds, and offer token holders both a real say in the project and the incentive needed to turn the dream into reality. The EarthFund toolkit is made for all three classes of participants in DAO initiatives. For founders, it offers an intuitive, plug-and-play platform that allows launching an ERC-20 token and DAO with gasless governance. For users, the platform brings rewards for using their voice and voting to advance the cause they committed to. For donors, EarthFund offers a place to donate crypto to people dedicated to vetting projects and making sure the money makes as large of an impact as possible. The launch brings pilot initiatives by Deepak Chopra, who will focus on raising funds for mental health projects around the world, and Dr. Lucy Tweed, who will launch the Carbon Removal cause to support community-led carbon removal projects. “We’re seeing a shift in the crypto space from a focus on short-term profits to using it to build a better future for everybody. That’s why we partnered with EarthFund to launch our NeverAlone token and democratize and decentralize the way that projects focused on tackling the mental health crisis get the funding they need to make a difference,” commented Chopra. “By launching causes like ours, the EarthFund platform won’t just change the crypto space, but make the whole world a better, happier place.” EarthFund aims to solve a number of issues that have disillusioned people from donating to worthwhile causes. Chief among them is the accountability of funds, with charities usually taking between 26% and 87% of donated funds for “administrative” purposes, while the remainder is deployed as the creators see fit. The decentralized governance model, as well as the transparency of the blockchain ecosystem, can make a dramatic impact on charity giving efficiency. “We think crypto has an unparalleled opportunity to be a massive force for good, but it hasn’t been fully adopted yet mainly because of usability,” said Adam Boalt, Co-Founder of EarthFund. “So far, crypto native folks have spent their energy on often frivolous causes, such as trying to buy a piece of paper or a virtual monkey profile picture, but with EarthFund, we’re focused on making crypto accessible so everyone can harness its potential and help truly world-changing causes to get the funding they deserve.” Co-founded byAdam Boalt, EarthFund is a decentralized platform that allows anyone to set up DAOs to fund causes they love, with real and meaningful impact. With a simple UI and a full-stack ecosystem approach, founders, donors and users can make their voice heard in the real world."
2022.6.15,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/15/cakedefi-reassures-customers-amid-crypto-turmoil-and-fear-of-celsius-insolvency/,"The Crypto turmoil of the past few days has been nothing short of fear and anxiety for investors. Just last Friday, Bitcoin was trading at around $30,000. Then over the weekend, crypto lenderCelsius announced it was pausing all account withdrawals, sparking fears among investors that the crypto lending giantmight be insolvent andgo bust. The announcement from Celsius rippled through the entire crypto market causing bitcoin to fall as much as 20% before settling at over $21,000 as of the time of writing. The liquidity crisis at Celsius also has crypto investors worried about a broader contagion that could potentially bring down other major players in the crypto market. To allay fears and worries, one crypto firm we’ve covered times and times again is now reassuring its customersthat the current market conditions will have little or no impact on its daily business. Cake DeFi isa Singapore-based fintech platform that’s making decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible to the masses. The fintech startup has been pushing the envelope toempower users to harness the potential of DeFi and theservices and applications accessible to everyonesince its inception three years ago. While Celsius is pausing all account withdrawals,CakeDeFi reassured its customers that it continues to process 99% of all withdrawals within 24 hours, the company said in a blog post on Monday. “As usual, we are processing 99% of all withdrawals within 24 hours, even though some can take up to a maximum of 72 hours. In such uncertain times, exceptional service is of even greater importance. We, therefore, are working even harder than usual to ensure our services are working seamlessly.” That’s not all. The company also goes on to explain its inner workings and what sets its apart from Celsius and other competitors. As most crypto investors know, some of the traits of most failed crypto companies are bad leadership, lack of trust, and transparency. Cake DeFi was founded in 2019 by Julian Hosp and U-Zyn Chua. As of trust in the company, Cake DeFi has built partnerships with a dozen of other companies since its inception three years ago. As we also reported on Monday, Cake DeFi announced it has paid out over $317 million to customers, as part of the milestone marking its 3rd Anniversary. The fintech startup also announced it now has over $1 billion of customer assets on its platform, as of the end first quarter of 2022, further highlighting the growing users’ interest and trust in the company. One of the ways CakeDeFi increases trust and attracts new customers is through transparency. Unlike other fly-by-night projects, Cake DeFi integrates transparency to the core of its business and how it operates. In addition, the company also has to abide by Singapore’s financial laws and regulations. “As a Singapore-based fintech company, we have to ensure clear asset segregation whereby customers’ assets are kept separate from the company’s operating accounts. Simply put, our users have full control, full ownership, and full authority over their funds,” Cake DeFi said. “As crypto investors continue to deal with the challenges of a volatile crypto market, we believe that crypto companies should up the ante in terms of providing both assurance and protection to their users and their hard-earned money. Providing transparency and protection is not only an obligation for us: it’s a must.”"
2022.6.16,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/16/ankrs-open-source-scaling-improvements-bring-unparalleled-performance-bnb-chain/,"Ankr has been making headlines in recent weeks, as the Web3 infrastructure provider continues to help developers, decentralized applications (dApps), and stakers interact easily withmultiple blockchains. Just this week, we wrote about Ankr after the blockchain infrastructure startup became an RPC provider to Ethereum L2 scaling solution Optimism. Ankr is one of those companies you’ve probably used its services without knowing it.Ankr provides underlying infrastructure plumbing that makes using dApps,crypto games, and wallets possible by connecting them to the blockchains they need to communicate with. In addition, for some time now the transfer of assets across different blockchains was a complicated activity. This is now made easier by the growing Web3 ecosystem. Ankr is an integral part of this movement and it’s created for userslooking for a streamlined way of connecting and interacting with multiple blockchains. The best way to understand Ankr is to think of all the projects and dApps of Web3 as city blocks, Ankr is like the underlying utility service or grid that powers it all. However,connecting projects and users to blockchains aren’t the only thing Ankr does. In addition,Ankr also helps blockchain companies run their blockchains faster, enabling them to offer users the best Web3 experiences.Ankr is improving the user experience of Web3 from top to bottom to lay the foundation for Web3 adoption on a massive scale. And that’s why Ankr is providing an extensive level of engineering support for the public goods that make Web3 and ecosystems like the BNB Smart Chain possible. In the fall of 2021, Ankr heard calls for assistance to improve the BNB Smart Chain’s performance across its ecosystem of dApps, games, governance platforms, and other stakeholders. Immediately, Ankr got to work after consulting with the Binance team. Since then, Ankr has implemented several open-source performance improvements that completely overhauled the BSC with a 10x increase in RPC request throughput, 75% reduction in storage requirements, a sync process that is 100x faster, and an entirely new framework for scaling the blockchain’s operations with application-specific sidechains. Commenting on how Ankr’s upgrades have scaled the BNB Chain,BNB Chain Ecosystem CoordinatorBNB Chain Ecosystem Coordinator said, “Ankr is a key infrastructure provider for the BNB Chain ecosystem — their contributions and expertise were critical in implementing upgrades to the BNB Chain with the Erigon client, rewriting archive node infrastructure, and creating a framework for BNB Application Sidechains. This allows the BNB Chain ecosystem to remain competitive and offer both users and builders the latest benefits.” In a behind-the-scenes post on Medium that looked into how Ankr’s upgrades to the BNB Chain ecosystem are empowering the next stage of Web3 development,Ankr explained how itfirst discovered the inefficiencies with the BNB Smart Chain in its own operations as they are the predominant RPC provider to the chain and one of its 21 validators. Even Ankr’s team, which was highly experienced with BSC ops, had difficulty staying at block height as it experienced extreme traffic volumes. As the BSC was such a popular choice for dApps and games (because of high throughput and low fees), this led to the chain becoming bogged down as it struggled with server capacities.  After discovering these problems, Ankr took it upon itself to create a multi-pronged approach to increase the capacity of the BNB Chain: The Erigon Performance Upgrade: Ankr’s engineering team found that by implementing the Erigon client that was originally created for Ethereum, they could drastically reduce storage capacity and sync time requirements. This was a project that took extremely advanced engineering knowledge and resources. Ankr successfully implemented a version of Erigon for the BNB Chain that solved scalability issues and made the new version of Erigon for the BSC open-source and available to all. This solution is now used by the majority of the ecosystem, from Chainstack to Covalent. BNB Application Sidechains (BAS): Ankr then made a proposal to Binance to help scale the protocol completely. BSC is a fork of Ethereum but has low gas fees and fast block generation periods which lead to much higher transactions per block. This puts a great deal of stress on the chain and its ability to scale. Ankr proposed a multi-chain scaling solution that was mature enough to handle advanced use cases like GameFi, unlike Layer-2 solutions. Ankr modified the consensus layer of the BSC to enable staking for new sidechains’ native tokens while preserving its full EVM capabilities. This means that BNB Application Sidechains would allow projects to launch their own chains effectively as Layer-1s with their own native ERC-20 or BEP-20 tokens and complete customization over the chain. BAS dApp Launching Assistance: Since Ankr helped create BAS, they are uniquely positioned as an onramp to help projects launch their own blockchain with customized designs on this new scaling framework with a full set of tools such as customized system contracts, custom tokenomics, inflation models, global gas fee revenues, testnet faucets, block explorers, and gaming SDKs. Ankr has already successfully launched the first game on BAS, Meta Apes. Ankr provided our open-source gaming SDK that allowed the Meta Apes game studio to take an already-popular game, Age of Apes, and give it full Web3, blockchain, and crypto capabilities. BNB Liquid Staking: Ankr further supported the BNB Chain ecosystem with the first BNB Liquid Staking solution that brings DeFi composability on top of staked BNB. This means that BNB holders can have increased options when it comes to choosing how to earn in DeFi with their assets – with the ability to combine strategies like staking, farming, lending, contributing to vaults, and more simultaneously. This solution is open-source, allowing for integrations for all BNB DeFi platforms. This brings in increased TVL and DeFi rewards across the BNB ecosystem. At the end of Ankr’s scaling improvements, the results were obvious with immediate key benefits: Going forward, Ankr said it will continue to support the BNB Chain ecosystem with upgrades to improve security with a beacon chain model of multichain communication. They will also build solutions for more native cross-chain asset transfer capability with lower transfer costs and enhanced security. Founded in 2017 by Chandler Song and Ryan Fang,Ankr is building the future of decentralized infrastructure and multi-chain solutions, servicing over 50 proof-of-stake chains with an industry-leading global node delivery system and a developer toolkit. Ankr serves over 1T transactions a year across Web3 and is the main infrastructure provider for the BNB Chain, Fantom, and Polygon as of 2022."

Musk also took questions from Twitter employees during the Q&A session. In a video posted on Twitter, Musk told the employees that“It’s important to represent multiple opinions & not driving a narrative.” Musk also added that there needs to be transparency in order for people to have to trust Twitter.  Addressing Twitter employees for the first time and answering pre-submitted questions, Musk also said thatTwitter employees doing “excellent” work should be allowed to continue working from home. But he also clarified that he strongly prefers to work in person. “If someone can only work remotely, and they’re exceptional, it wouldn’t make sense to fire them,” Musk reiterated. On April 25, Twitter agreed to sell the company to Elon Musk for $44 billion but the deal hit a few bumps on the road after Elon Musk’s lawyers sent a letter to Twitter threatening to terminate the $44 billion deal over the inflated user data.Last week,Twitter agreed to comply with Elon Musk’s bot data demands. The$44 billion purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter’s closing stock price onApril 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter.Musk needed to use his Tesla stock to raise $21 billion in equity to fund his takeover of the social media giant. Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive$54.20in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing the proposed transaction.

2022.6.16,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/16/lightning-ai-unveils-new-open-source-platform-reinvent-ai-based-applications-built-raises-40-million-series-b-funding/,"Lightning AI, the creator of the popularopen-source Python library PyTorch Lightning, todayunveiled a new open-source platform that reinvents how AI-based applications are built. Serving as the “operating system for AI,” the new Lightning AI platform unifies the full AI/ML development and infrastructure lifecycle by combining a variety of products, components, and tools to accelerate how AI-based applications are built.The new platform stems from years of AI and ML research to eliminate the barriers to widespread AI adoption. Several companies, including Mars and NVIDIA. In addition to the launch,Lightning AI also announced it has raised $40M Series B to completely reimagine how Artificial Intelligence (AI) products, services, and experiences are built. The latest round brings the company’s total funding to $58.6 million. This $40 million Series B funding round, led by Coatue with participation from Index, Bain, First Minute Capital, and the Chainsmokers’ Mantis VC, brings the total raised to date to $58.6 million. Coatue General Partner Caryn Marooney has joined the board of directors, which also includes Index Ventures Partner Bryan Offutt. The capital will fuel further technology innovation, fund new AI research, and be invested back in the company’s growing user community and ecosystem. Lightning AI’s mission is to lower the barriers to AI adoption as the global AI market is skyrocketing and on track to exceed $500 billion by 2024. Co-founded in 2018 by William Falcon,Lightning AI (formerly Grid.ai) is the culmination of work that began in 2018 at the New York University CILVR Lab (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision, and Robotics) and Facebook AI Research. As a Ph.D. student working alongside advisers Kyunghyun Cho and Yann LeCun, William Falcon created and open-sourced the popular PyTorch Lightning framework, one of the fastest-growing AI projects with over 4 million monthly downloads. The explosive growth of the project within the AI community-led Falcon to build a platform and company focused on eliminating barriers to widespread AI adoption. Serving as the “operating system for AI,” Lightning AI’s platform ushers in a new era of accessibility and sophistication in the field of AI technology. The platform and underlying framework introduce a novel way to build AI by providing a unified experience that accelerates the deployment of AI technology across academic and enterprise use cases. Amid a fragmented machine learning ecosystem, Lightning AI’s suite of extensible open-source components and apps simplifies the underserved space and helps advance the widespread adoption of AI technology. “Launching this platform is a vital step for our company and the industry,” says William Falcon, Lightning AI co-founder and CEO. “From day one, I wanted to reimagine the experience of building artificial intelligence beyond the current surfeit of tools and systems. Until now, there hasn’t been a way to build production-grade AI apps that takes into account the entire pipeline from development to production. Current options are limiting, highly prescriptive, and lack the flexibility needed to leverage AI in real-world scenarios. Imagine wanting to make a phone call and you’re simply handed the disparate parts that make up a working telephone, hoping that one day you’ll be able to make a phone call. Lightning AI takes the principles that have made PyTorch Lightning one of the fastest-growing open-source projects in history – simplicity, modularity, and sustainability – and applies them to the task of unifying the entire AI development and infrastructure lifecycle.” Grounded in the success of the PyTorch Lightning framework, the company built Grid, a platform for developing and training machine learning models on the cloud. “We are excited about the development Lightning AI is leading by allowing AI-driven applications relevant to specific verticals to come to life in a simple way. The partnership will bring further ease-of-use to customers and fit well with AWS’s industry, use-case, and business problem-driven approach,” said Dr. Kristof Schum, Global Segment Leader of Machine Learning at Amazon Web Services.  Commenting on the funding,CoatueGeneral PartnerCaryn Marooney said, “As more companies across every sector leverage AI for crucial functions, they need a solution that makes it simple to consume, train, and use AI while also building applications free from vendor lock-in and specialized AI experts.” She also added, “Coatue immediately saw the potential and significance of Lightning AI’s mission to democratize AI. We look forward to supporting William and his team as they write a new playbook for AI deployment.” Lightning AI allows researchers, data scientists, and software engineers to build, share and iterate on highly scalable, production-ready AI apps using the tools and technologies of their choice, regardless of their expertise. To solve any kind of AI problem from research to deployment and production-ready pipelines, users can simply group components of their choice into a Lightning App and customize the underlying code as needed. Lightning Apps can then be republished back into the community for future use, or kept private in users’ personal libraries. Lightning AI combines a wide variety of extant tools into a modular, intuitive platform for building AI applications in research, enterprise, and personal contexts. It is the foundation of the growing Lightning ecosystem, which provides developers with a suite of ready-to-use tools and required infrastructure and compute resources, as well as community support for building AI applications."
2022.6.16,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/16/irish-conversational-ai-startup-webio-raises-4m-disrupt-revolutionize-credit-collections-payments-industry/,"Over the past decade, artificial intelligence has disrupted many industries including banking, payment and finance, healthcare, medicine, and law. Fueled by increased productivity and efficiency,the disruption has also brought about exponential growth. However, the credit and collections functions of the payment industry have not received much technological attention. They are still outdated and ripe for disruption. Now one Irish startup is leading the change by using conversational AI to disrupt and revolutionize the collections and payments industry. Today, Webio announced today it has closed a $4 million in a Series A funding round led by Finch Capital. With this funding, Webio will its technology scale-up following the digital shift during the pandemic and the uncertain economic climate to make difficult conversations about payments easy through their Conversation AI. The Dublin, Ireland-based Webio will also use the new funds to deepen its capabilities in conversational AI and additional digital offerings. They plan to triple the company’s R&D team, expand the sales and marketing teams, and expand its customer success teams to address the market demand in the UK and European markets. Founded in 2016 by Mark Oppermann, Cormac O’Neill, and Paul Sweeney, Webio’s platform enables the credit industry to positively and empathetically engage with their in-debt and vulnerable customers. Webio’s aim is to rebalance the Credit, Collections, and Payment ecosystem by reimagining the way lenders engage and converse with customers. Webio’s technology has enabled leading the UK and European companies to communicate conversationally with customers throughout their credit and collections journey. Customers can ask questions, change payment dates, or organize a new repayment schedule, all tailored to their circumstances, all done through Conversational AI and automation. Customers experience the assurance that they have been engaged with, listened to, and interacted with fairly and appropriately and in turn, are more likely to be able to keep to their repayment schedules. The jewel in the crown is Webio’s ability to ‘move the needle’ in predicting conversation outcomes by analyzing what is said and how it is said. Identifying characteristics such as a person’s potential vulnerability early and accurately, and then guiding that customer conversations through a range of best next steps dynamically is an example of a critical capability in this market. Webio clients can manage their collections conversations on a level like never before. They can know faster, act sooner, and do so with confidence. “Conversations about money are stressful and difficult, not only for the customer but also for agents tasked with having these conversations. Going digital means companies can create a whole new set of digital experiences that help customers feel more confident in having those difficult conversations and ultimately, stop them from falling into unnecessary and significant financial difficulty. And we are excited that Webio’s conversational AI is enabling companies to engage with customers in a more empathetic manner, at scale”, says Cormac O’Neill, Co-Founder and CEO at Webio. Cormac O’Neill said,“We are growing at more than 100% year on year, and we are targeted to double our headcount with this investment in the next 6 months. I am confident that Webio will maintain its rate of growth and may look to raise additional capital to enter new markets. There are very exciting times ahead for us. We are certainly in the right market and at the right time. All I can say is watch this space,” Cormac O’Neill added. Historically, the credit and collections functions have been neglected, but now the digital transformation is a necessity. During the pandemic, companies had to sell services online and provide customer service entirely digitally. Taking a call at the kitchen table was not practical where sensitive financial conversations were involved, so companies moved to digital messaging over WhatsApp, SMS, and Webchat. A recent Deloitte study states that 60% of organizations reported progress on connecting service channels during this time, with 11% reporting that they can transition customers across channels and experiences seamlessly. The number of financial services organizations implementing conversational AI and digital assistants doubled over the pandemic and the privacy-first custom assistant model provided by Webio is finding resonance in the collection’s world."

The news comes at a time when many of AAX’s competitorsincluding Coinbase, announced significant staff reductions. In a statement,AAX (Atom Asset Exchange)said it is hiring for hundreds of roles as it aims to double its staff size this year to support its global expansion plans.At a time when crypto market sentiment is filled with fear and uncertainties, AAX also plans to open additional offices to support new markets and add staff to expand expertise and product lines, in a signof continued growth. It’s no surprise thatsuccessful companies are built during recessions and that’s why AAX is taking a long-term view by focusing on hiring the most valuable asset for the success of any organization–people. In a tweet, AAX Head of Research and Strategy Ben Caselin said, to see “exchanges laying people off during bear markets is very strange and reactive only. Bear markets are for building and for building, we need people.” Globally—and in emerging markets particularly—the adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets is still expanding and helping to create more inclusive economies as well as fair and wider-reaching financial applications. Financial inclusion is more than a buzzword. It requires actual efforts to deliver on the promise. As part of the endeavor targeting emerging markets, AAX was the first crypto exchange to adopt Satoshi Standard (SATS) to users and integrate the lightning network, putting their conviction into building a digital asset exchange for everyone. “We believe that’s just the beginning in delivering on our mission. That’s why we are hiring even under these turbulent market conditions. The evolution of money is a long-term growth story and our talent recruitment strategy aligns with that fact. Our commitment to emerging markets is part of that same growth story,” Caselin said. Founded in 2018 byThor Chan and after more than 18 months of research and development, the exchange was officially launched in November 2019.Used by more than two million users in over 160 countries, AAX is the first exchange to use the Satoshi Standard (SATS) to drive the adoption of Bitcoin. AAX is also the first to be powered by LSEG Technology, offering high-yield savings packages, 200+ spot pairs,P2P fiat trading, deeply liquid futures markets, regular discounts on major tokens, and a range of on- and off-ramp products."

Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, it’s thefirst decentralized metaverse that is built, governed, and owned by its users. The most popular game on Decentraland is Decentral Games, the play-and-earn gaming project launched in October 2021 that now accounts for ~60% of all traffic within the Decentraland metaverse. One of Decentral Games’ products now has the largest grant in Decentraland history supporting its ICE coin.Following a hard-fought battle, the Decentraland DAOhas just awarded a $1 million grant worth of $MANA to support Decentral Games’ $ICE token as they prepare to roll out their much-anticipated sit-and-go tournament competition and alsoto bolster their $USDC – $ICE liquidity pool. The proposal, which sparked a lot of debate within both communities and passed with a tight margin, would be one of the largest ecosystem grants that Decentraland has ever awarded. Decentral Games submitted the original proposal back on May 20, where it ignited fierce debate amongst DAO members. Eventually, on May 25 Decentral Games won out with 59% of the overall votes. Now, Decentral Games will use the funds to stabilize the ICE Poker ecosystem as it launches its latest upgrade, earmarking the entire $1 million in $MANA to provide rewards in the Quickswap staking pool for the next three months. Commenting on the grant,Decentral Games CMO Matthew Howells-Barby said, “The passing of this proposal shows the support we have from the Decentraland community and how important Decentral Games has become as a major contributor to daily active users. These incentives will enable us to create further stability to our ecosystem ahead of rolling out our new sit-and-go poker tournament mode that we believe will bring a whole new experience to our Decentraland venues and will help us to onboard thousands of new users to the nascent metaverse.” Decentral Games CEO Miles Anthony also commented, “We’ve had conviction around Decentraland and its role in delivering an interactive 3D frontend for the open metaverse from its inception in 2017. Since then, we’ve purchased 1000+ parcels of LAND and invested millions of dollars to build engaging content to attract and retain over 60% of the platform’s users. This MANA allocation is a stepping stone to assist in boosting our in-game economy as we prepare to launch ICE Poker Sit-n-Go tournaments, along with other key initiatives that drive organic demand and utility for ICE and solidify our ecosystem’s long-term sustainability. With the support of the Decentraland team and community, we look forward to onboarding the next million users into Decentraland and the nascent metaverse.” The plan will also bring additional liquidity into the pool and help to correct the imbalance that is leading ICE holders to become MANA holders. Founded in 2017 byAri Meilich and Esteban Ordano,Decentraland is a virtual reality platform that allows users to explore the metaverse. The platform has more than300,000 monthly active users and20,000 daily active users."

According to the announcement, Engage Raiseis set to launch in July justas the 2022 midterm elections heat up. Founded byMartin Dobelle, CEO of Engage Labs, the parent company of Engage Raise,Dobelle said he got the idea to create an online platform for political donors to use cryptocurrencies “as the larger crypto industry becomes a powerful lobbying force in Washington.” Dobelle is right.Since the start of the 2020 election cycle, crypto executives have contributed more than $30 million toward federal candidates and campaigns, even as more crypto advocates such as bitcoin investor Erik Finman become key campaign funders. Investors are already warming up to the idea.Dobelle said Engage’s parent company has already raised almost $1 million in pre-seed investments. Dobelle told CNBC that a chunk of the early financing came from business leaders, including Al Reid, founding partner of Calypso Investment Partners, and Raf Michalowski, CEO of hotspot seller CoastFi. “Candidates can use our platform to connect with the crypto and blockchain community via fundraising, events, and messaging,” Martin Dobelle, CEO of Engage Labs, the parent company of Engage Raise, told CNBC in an email. Campaigns will be able to process contributions in all major cryptocurrencies through a web browser or by adding a widget to their websites, Dobelle said. Although digital currencies are known for allowing their owners to conduct transactions anonymously, all crypto donations through Engage will need to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission like most campaign contributions. Meanwhile, thenews of the upcoming platform launch comes at a time when bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market are going through a major market correction. Bitcoin has fallen by 70% from its all-time high of over $68,000 in 2021. “We’re optimistic that the broader market will recover, along with crypto, and that a major crypto up-cycle will lead into the crucially important election in 2024,” Dobelle said."

Over the weekend, Singapore-based Three Arrows becomes the latest in a series of crypto companies reeling from the ongoing meltdown in the crypto market. Then on Monday,Celsius Network, one of the largest players in the crypto lending space, said it was freezing all withdrawals and transfers for all of its 1.7 million crypto customers due to what the crypto startup described as “extreme market conditions.” Then yesterday, cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund Three Arrows Capital announced it is unable to meet margin call demands from lenders, causing the leading crypto hedge fund into a crisis that comes as turmoil and credit crunch grip the crypto market.Three Arrows is one of the biggest and most active players in the crypto industry with investments spanning the lending and trading platforms. According to The Wall Street Journal, Three Arrows is now considering selling its assets.The hedge fund has also hired legal and financial advisers to help work out a solution for its investors and lenders, after suffering heavy losses from a broad market selloff in digital assets, the firm’s founders said on Friday. “We have always been believers in crypto and we still are,” Kyle Davies, Three Arrows’s co-founder, said in an interview. “We are committed to working things out and finding an equitable solution for all our constituent.” Meanwhile, Three Arrows’ margin call has already rippled through the entire crypto market. One of the affected crypto companies is crypto lender BlockFi, which recently announcedthat it has liquidated its position in Three Arrows. In a tweet on the group’s positions. In a tweet, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince said: “I’ve been seeing a lot of speculation about BlockFi’s risk management practices that I want to address. While our policy is to not comment on specific counterparties, we are committed to providing as much transparency as possible, and it’s important to know the following:” BlockFi can confirm that we exercised our best business judgment recently with a large client that failed to meet its obligations on an overcollateralized margin loan. We fully accelerated the loan and fully liquidated or hedged all the associated collateral. — Zac Prince (@BlockFiZac) June 16, 2022  But many BlockFi customers aren’t buying it.

In 2020, Three Arrows “made a “strategic” investment in BlockFi” before it later exited the following year. People familiar with the situation also told The Financial Times that Three Arrows had borrowed bitcoin from BlockFi “but had been unable to meet a margin call. One of the people said the liquidation had occurred by mutual consent.” “We are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out,” said Su Zhu, Three Arrows co-founder, on Twitter on Wednesday, without specifically identifying any counterparty. The company did not respond to a request for comment. Yuri Mushkin, BlockFi’s chief risk officer, said the group “can confirm that we exercised our best business judgment recently with a large client that failed to meet its obligations . . . We believe we were one of the first to take action with this counterparty.” Founded by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez in 2017, BlockFi is a provider of cryptocurrency-focused financial products, including zero-fee trading and interest-bearing accounts.

That sounds like a perfect idea except thatdeveloping an autonomous indoor security robot has been a great challenge for robotics designers for many years. While some ground-based robots are commercially available, ordinary items like a chair or a step can prevent them from fully securing an area, until now. EnterIndoor Robotics, aninnovative Israeli tech startup and the developer of Tando, the world’s first commercially available indoor drone that enables enhanced building security and monitoring.Tando is making major global security companies and enterprises rethink the way they view indoor drones. Unlike other products on the market today,Indoor Robotics’ Tando uses multiple sensors and proprietary algorithms to accurately map and navigate in any indoor space, allowing it to autonomously navigate above or around any items in its path, enabling it to secure and monitor large areas.Indoor Robotics combines the best of innovative technology and human mobilityto provide AI-operated security systems ofthe highest standard, the company said on its website. After launching its Tando drone a few weeks ago,Indoor Robotics announced this week it has closed $15 million in series A fundingto boost product development and enable intelligent indoor security worldwide.The round was led by Pitango and included Target Global, European Innovation Council Fund, and Spider Capital. Indoor Robotics was founded in 2018 by Doron Ben David and Amit Moran. Ben David had left his role as CTO of Israel Aerospace Industries’ Space Division when he began to collaborate with Moran, former Head of Robotics Innovation at Intel. They set their attention to drones, looking for areas where they could outperform human beings. They recognized that drones were ideal for security, an industry that suffers from 300% employee turnover, is vulnerable to fatigue and human error and pays minimum wage to guards tasked with protecting valuable assets. “We reimagined what a drone was capable of and combined human-like capabilities with AI tools to enable next-generation security and monitoring,” said Doron Ben David, co-founder, and CEO of Indoor Robotics. “Tando has already been deployed by the world’s leading enterprises and security monitoring companies and is making a tangible impact on safety and security.” Tando docks on the ceiling and functions as a security camera when not in flight. In addition to office buildings, it is currently being used to secure and monitor warehouses, data centers, malls, and retail establishments by well-known enterprises. These funds will also enable Indoor Robotics to move into full production and develop its go-to-market strategy. “We seized the opportunity to increase our investment in Indoor Robotics following the successful launch of Tando™ and the team’s demonstrated ability to surpass critical milestones,” said Rami Kalish, managing partner at Pitango. “Indoor Robotics’ proven capabilities have generated exciting demand from the market, which the investors are excited to facilitate.” In addition to security functions, Tando™ drives significant safety and operational improvements. It is capable of collecting thermal imaging data and environmental data, as well as recording temperatures of rooms and identifying leaks. It also enables preventive maintenance, identifying areas in buildings that require care. The drone fits in line with the company’s mission to boost the quality of life by enabling a seamless, comfortable indoor experience through task-oriented robots. Below is a video of Tando in action."

The following day,Bitcoin tumbled below $21,000 for the first since 2020 as the crypto market topped $2 trillion. In amemoto clients on Monday, Celsius said:“Due to extreme market conditions, today we are announcing that Celsius is pausing all withdrawals, Swap, and transfers between accounts.” To stay afloat,Celsius said that it’s looking into restructuring its operations, following announcements on June 12 that it “[needs] to stabilize liquidity and operations” and take “take steps to preserve and protect assets.”The beleaguered startup has reportedly hired lawyers with expertise in restructuring and insolvency to help it navigate the current market andremedy its financial woes. As of mid-May, Celsius held approximately $12 billion in assets. People familiar with the ongoing situation also told the Wall Street Journal that Celsius had hired restructuring lawyers after the account freeze andis considering alternative financing from investors and is open to a different financial structure. However, that’s not stopped users and investors from asking this simple question: How did we get here? How come no one saw the writing on the wall? To answer these questions, it is critical to understand the people behind the company. Celsius was founded in 2017 byAlex Mashinsky and S. Daniel Leon.The five-year-old cryptocurrency lending platformoffers crypto investors higher-than-average interest rates on their deposits.As of May,Celsius has more than $8 billion lent out to clients and almost $12 billion in assets under management,its website said, down by more than half from October, and had processed a total of $8.2 billion worth of loans. The first thing everyone should know about Alex is that he claimed to have a lot of experience. According to a 1999 article referenced on The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website, Alex “tried importing urea from Russia, selling Indonesian gold to Switzerland and brokering poisonous sodium cyanide excavated in China for use by gold miners in the U.S.” “He [Alex] tried importing urea from Russia, selling Indonesian gold to Switzerland and brokering poisonous sodium cyanide excavated in China for use by gold miners in the U.S. The cyanide business collapsed in 1989 as Mashinsky watched the Tiananmen Square crackdown on CNN.” These businesses eventually failed and Alex pivoted. That was not all. According to Alex’s own personal website,Alex claimed to be “the founder of eight startups and three Unicorns.” He also claimed to have invented voice over internet protocol (VOIP) technology. “Alex has raised more than $1.5B with over $3B+ in exits, 50+ patents, and now leads the Celsius team with over $25B in crypto assets,” he said on his website. It lets you earn interest on your crypto and instantly borrow against it. That startup has built the next generation of decentralized lending and borrowing products leveraging cryptocurrency.Celsius Network addresses the financial needs of today’s consumers worldwide through a high-interest income and low-cost lending accessible via a mobile app. However, according to a tweet from Dirty Bubble Media, citing a Celsius insider,“Celsius is recalling loans to their institutional borrowers.” https://twitter.com/MikeBurgersburg/status/1537978719519707138 But the current situation with Celsius seems to be a lot more precarious. According to a Reddit user, Celsius has stopped accepting its own token ( $CEL ) for interest payments. In an alleged and undated letter sent to one of its users, Celsius said, “Currently, we are not accepting CEL as an available interest payment option.” lol according to a reddit user, celsius stopped accepting their own token ( $CEL ) for interest payments pic.twitter.com/3BnBOlN12e — Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) June 17, 2022  But Celsius woes seem to be a lot deeper than we were first made aware of. CoffeeZilla, a Youtuber known for exposing scams, said that “Celsius had further issues with an ETH2.0 derivative on DEFI pools where they found themselves stuck either keeping their staked ETH2 or selling a derivative worth less.” In a related report, CoinDesk explained how‘Staked Ether’ became the focus of crypto stress and how it spread from Celsius to Three Arrows. Another crypto news outlet also suggested thatbankruptcy may be the only option left for Celsius. In the video below, CoffeeZillawent into greater detail about why Celsius fell apart. Enjoy!"

It was bitcoin’s lowest sinceDecember 2020. Ether, the second-largest token, also plunged 11% to $987.35, its lowest level since January 2021. The recent rates hike by the Federal Reserves has also rippled across the entire crypto market. On Wednesday,The Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points, its biggest increase since 1994. That has led to a pullback from risky assets of all stripes, including stocks and crypto.  The carnage started last weekend aftercrypto lenderCelsius Network, one of the largest players in the crypto lending space,announced it was freezing all withdrawals and transfers for all of its 1.7 million crypto customers due to what the crypto startup described as “extreme market conditions.” Then on Friday, Hong Kong-based crypto lender Babel Finance announced it was temporarily suspending the withdrawals and redemption of crypto assets, as the company scrambles to pay its clients. While manycrypto investors were hoping the recent dip was just a bump on the road, Bitcoin has since shed more than $11,000 from its$30,000 peak on June 10. While some crypto investors arestill “buying the dip,” many experts are now warning the situation could get worse before they get better. In a post on Twitter, economist Peter Schiff said that bitcoin has no viable support left at this point. “With Bitcoin’s morning low near $18.7k, the hope that the 2017 peak of $20K would act as support is gone. Objectively, looking at the chart, there really is no viable support left. Most likely #Bitcoin will find some short-term support along the long-term trend line around $6K,” Schiff tweeted.

Musk’s comment wasenough to cause Dogecoin to rise by 8% to $0.058. However, the5.8 cents is a far cry from a 91% drop from Dogecoin’s all-time record of the 72 cents touched in May 2021. In a tweet today, Musk said he would continue to support the meme coin. “I will keep supporting Dogecoin,” Musk tweeted. I will keep supporting Dogecoin — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2022  When asked if he would keep buying DOGE, Musk responded, “I am.” I am — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2022  Musk’ssupport tweet, which predictably gives Dogecoin the needed price bounce, came just a week after he and his companies weresued over an alleged Dogecoin “pyramid scheme.” Musk was sued on Thursday for $258 billion by a Dogecoin investor who accused the billionaire of running a pyramid scheme to support the cryptocurrency, Reuters reported. In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan, plaintiff Keith Johnson accused Musk, his electric car company Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), and space company SpaceX of racketeering for touting Dogecoin and driving up its price, only to then let the price tumble. It’s unclear if the lawsuit prompted Musk to make the latest comment about his support for Dogecoin. “Defendants were aware since 2019 that Dogecoin had no value yet promoted Dogecoin to profit from its trading,” the complaint said. “Musk used his pedestal as World’s Richest man to operate and manipulate the Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme for profit, exposure, and amusement.” Dogecoin started as a joke in December 2013 based on the popular “doge” meme represented by a Shiba Inu dog as its logo, literally taken from the “Doge” meme. We wrote about Musk and Dogecoin back inJanuary after Musk continued his relentless promotion of Dogecoin saying that he would eat a happy meal on TV if Mcdonald’s accepted Dogecoin as payment. “I will eat a happy meal on tv if@McDonaldsaccepts Dogecoin,” Musk tweeted.Mcdonald’s has yet to take Musk up on the challenge. I will eat a happy meal on tv if @McDonalds accepts Dogecoin — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 25, 2022  For months, Musk has been promoting Dogecoin.Calling it people’s coin, Musk once told TMZ inan interview that Dogecoin could be the future of cryptocurrency. He also offered words of cautionfor crypto investors saying “Don’t take too much risk with cryptos.” “First of all, I think people should not invest their life savings in cryptocurrency. To be clear, I think that’s unwise. But if you want to sort of speculate and maybe have some fun, there is a good chance that crypto is the future currency of Earth. And then, it’s like, which one is it going to be? Maybe it’ll be multiple. But it should be considered speculation at this point. So don’t go too far on the crypto speculation part,” Musk said while signing autographs. Some on social media as gone as far as calling Musk “The DogeFather,” a reference to the GodFather movie."
2022.6.20,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/20/iranian-cyberattack-suspected-behind-false-rocket-sirens-jerusalem-israeli-cybersecurity-startup-radiflow-says/,"Life momentarily came to a halt last night in the Israeli cities of Jerusalem and Eilat as air raid sirens were triggered, despite there being no projectile in motion. The Israeli military announced that they suspect the false alarm to have been triggered by a cybersecurity attack at the municipal levels, not via military systems. Without being triggered by any known sources, air raid sirens in the Israeli cities of Jerusalem and Eilat blared, creating commotion and finger-pointing. Now, an Israeli industrial cybersecurity startup said thatIran is suspected to have triggered the air raid sirens in Israel, a reminder of their growing cyber warfare capabilities. In a statement,Radiflow CEO Ilan Barda said, “Whether this siren attack by Iran was a false flag or accidental triggering remains to be seen but the lack of municipal cybersecurity is clear.” Just two years ago, Iran had successfully breached six Israeli water management facilities, threatening the health and safety of civilians. Yet, these threats are not limited to bouts between Israel and Iran. Throughout the US and Europe, breaches at the municipal level have been putting people in increased danger over the last few years. In July 2021, a Florida water management facility was attacked as hackers tried to poison the water by increasing the level of Sodium Hydroxide 11-fold. This puts consumers in danger of severe respiratory reactions as a result of this poisoning. Unfortunately, this story has been played out continuously over the last few years as OT environments, such as water, electricity, and other critical municipality-run facilities are brought online. Looking to the future, traffic lights, public transportation, and other municipality-run systems will be brought online and automated. Part of the challenge is that municipalities are not set up to manage the cat and mouse game that cybersecurity experts are accustomed to operating in. Once a cybersecurity system is in place, regardless of its capabilities, it will become obsolete as hackers learn how to discover and manipulate vulnerabilities. Without regular updates and management, even the best systems are put at risk. In the case of this morning’s sirens throughout two major Israeli cities, many answers remain unanswered. The first of which is, why carry out such a bold incident on an ordinary morning? If this was meant to cause disruption to civilian life, it would make more sense to conduct this incident during a religious holiday or time of large gatherings to shatter any sense of security. It is possible that the sirens were triggered while hackers were still exploring for vulnerabilities within the municipality’s security system or that it was a false flag, being used as a distraction as another not yet published cyber attack was carried out. An example of this was the 2017 Iranian cyber attack on Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, where a breach was discovered, only to have thousands of computer systems compromised later, causing a devastating meltdown or explosion. Going after a municipality would bring a city or region to a halt, impacting supply chains, food deliveries, and more- putting a city under siege. For municipalities of any region to protect themselves, they must work with experienced managed cybersecurity service providers who understand the layered nature of how today’s OT facilities and utilities operate in the online space. Without a deep understanding of industrial controls and their vulnerabilities, it is near impossible to properly secure them in the short or long term. For municipalities to be as secure as today’s leading technology firms, they must build a partnership with their managed cybersecurity service provider over time. This means that proper installation and maintenance is a top priority along with ongoing monitoring through a digital environment. This will go beyond being able to identify an attack, along with its gateway or access point, to allowing the team to practice mitigating attacks without impacting the physical environment. Only then can governments ensure that the critical systems their population relies on are truly safe. Founded in 2009 byIlan Barda, the Tel Aviv, Israel-based Radiflow is an OT Cyber Security company that has unique tools to protect and manage digital OT assets for the long term."
2022.6.20,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/20/sustainably-manage-reduce-waste-electric-electronic-equipment-weee/,"Sustainability is at the center of public discussion. In 2022, world leaders gathered at COP26, deciding that greenhouse gas emissions need to see a reduction of 45% by 2030, and net zero will be achieved by 2050. To achieve these goals, businesses throughout the nation must continue to minimize and reverse the negative effects of global warming. This can be achieved through actively reducing, reusing, and recycling wasted goods, including waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE). Here we will explore the importance of reducing, reusing, and recycling electrical items. First and foremost, businesses should think about reducing and reusing electrical waste. If the waste hierarchy is taken into account, elimination comes before anything else. This means thinking ahead and purchasing sustainable equipment with an Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) badge. EPEAT registered products must meet environmental performance criteria that address: materials selection, design for product longevity, reuse and recycling, energy conservation, end-of-life management, and corporate performance. It may also mean buying protective gear and prolonging the life of electrical items. In addition to this companies can consider the benefits of reusing electrical equipment. If business owners decide to upgrade their computers, they may wish to donate the replaced equipment rather than throwing these away. Not only will this prolong the life of such technologies, but it will also enable charities or organizations to give these to people who will benefit from them. In 2014, the UK government introduced the Waste Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulation. This has ensured that disposing of any electrical or white goods waste, from televisions to fridges and camcorders, is a legal requirement for consumers and businesses alike. WEEE recycling is best left to the professionals. To find out more about the importance of WEEE recycling, we have spoken to Tony Munro, Marketing Director at the Reconomy Group, a leading supplier of sustainable waste management solutions: “The correct disposal of electrical equipment is of utmost importance. In the UK alone, we produce 2 million tonnes of electric and white goods waste annually. Large items, such as fridges, account for over 40 percent of this. If poorly managed, this waste can accumulate, release harmful gases, and further damage our ecosystem. This is where WEEE recycling comes in, a system that ensures all electrical and white goods items are reused wherever possible. Here at the Reconomy Group, we encourage the regeneration of certain materials from these products, such as metals and glass. These can then be recycled and placed back into the circular economy.” The UK produces an inordinate amount of electrical waste. In 2019, this amounted to 1.6 million tonnes or 23.9kg of waste per person. To ensure the nation does correctly dispose of this waste, customers and corporations need to understand the dangers of wrongfully doing so. Technology was built to last. We wouldn’t want our mobile phones decomposing in our hands, after all. In fact, electrical waste can take 2 million years to decompose naturally, compared to just 2 weeks for paper. As a result, waste in landfills is not an option for electrical and white products. This means that incorrectly placing electrical or white goods in landfills can fast become an issue. The sites would no doubt overflow with the latest gadgets, and if the nation continues to amass a large amount of electrical waste, the chances of this happening grow more and more likely. In addition to lengthy decomposition timeframes, electrical waste can also contaminate the ground they are buried in. This is because they contain hazardous chemicals, such as mercury. Electrical appliances over 20 years old can contain asbestos, although it isn’t as commonplace today. Mercury can also be found in mobile phones made before 2006. These chemicals can be harmful to the ecosystem surrounding landfills and contaminate local water sources. Reducing, reusing, and recycling electrical equipment has never been easier. Businesses can access a wealth of information regarding the sustainability of electronics, giving everyone the chance to think with the environment in mind. Once companies decide that an electronic device is of no use, they can always donate these to other places and spaces that need it more. One of the key objectives of the WEEE directive is to reduce the amount of electrical products entering landfill sites in the UK, which is set to be achieved by placing an obligation on producers and manufacturers to provide free and accessible recycling services to their customers. So what about recycling? In the UK, less than 40 percent of our electrical waste is collected and recycled by professional and governmental bodies. Therefore, to ensure we build a brighter future for younger generations, sustainable waste management within the private sector is more important than ever. Whether you’re a small business or a multi-national corporation, you can benefit from partnering with a sustainable waste management company that provides WEEE recycling and the potential to increase social value. As well as this, you can use your status to influence those around you. How will you encourage WEEE recycling?"

However, making payments in the Web3 world also comes with some challenges. That’s why one South Korean startup has come out with a no-coding payment button to simplify Web3 payments. Today, Seoul, South Korea-based startup PIP announced a new PIP button that will allow users on social media channels to pay for creative content they love – using crypto. The PIP button will introduce the simplest way for everyone to access and utilize the advanced payment system on websites and personal media. The no-coding payment button helps everyone integrate blockchain payment systems and monetize content frictionlessly. The PIP Button will transform the content creator economy for the better. It is a non-invasive payment solution that enables millions of users to pay for creative content that they love much faster and more affordable by integrating major blockchain systems. Creators and service owners can integrate the PIP button into their website – or third-party platform where they share creations – and unlock an extra revenue stream. For the user, it is possible to pay for unique content or goods by clicking the button, providing a new use case for blockchain payment assets. More importantly, the PIP button provides something society has longed for: “the freedom to pay as they want.” Creators can benefit tremendously from integrating additional payment methods without coding knowledge. The PIP button is an open system removing the need for signups and accounts, creating a frictionless solution. Moreover, recipients can customize the button to their taste, ensuring it goes well with their branding, overlays, or stands more to draw attention to it. Integrating the PIP button will be as easy as making a new WordPress post or posting a new image/video to Instagram. The button works on any platform based on HTML, React, Javascript, and third-party services like WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, etc. Setting up the PIP button – which supports Solana tokens and transactions (including SOL, USDC, PIP, SERUM, RAY, KIN, ORCA, etc.) – requires setting up a wallet through Phantom Wallet or Slope Wallet. The team will roll out support for additional major blockchains over the coming months. The PIP button is, in essence, a way for content consumers to tip their [favorite] content creators through blockchain technology. Compared to legacy payment systems that demand complex knowledge and coding experience to attach, this simple button made with just a few clicks will provide the gateway to the innovative payment infrastructure without any obstacles. PIP offers a fully integrated suite of payment products with a strong focus on social payments. More importantly, users can claim a unique PIP tag they can use across all websites and platforms or share it via social media like Twitter, Reddit, Discord, and Twitch."

Last Friday, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the social giant is launching a digital clothing store where users can purchase designer outfits for their avatarsfor real money.Speaking in a live video stream with Instagram’s head of fashion,Zuckerberg said the new fashion story will feature virtual outfits designed by fashion brands Balenciaga, Prada, and Thom Browne. A Meta spokesperson also said that the virtual outfits will be priced between $2.99 and $8.99, much less than the real outfits by those designers. Prada’s Matinee ostrich leather bag, for example, sells for $10,700.Zuckerberg said he hoped to build the store out into an open marketplace where developers can create and sell a wide array of digital clothes.  The fashion store has also become a new revenue-generating stream for the company. As Reuters reported back in April, Meta will take a cut of almost half of creators’ sales of digital goods and services inside its metaverse platform Horizon Worlds. With the popularity of gaming platforms like Fortnite, avatars have emerged as one of the ways for users to share their unique identities in the virtual world. In a statement, Meta said that users of its virtual reality headsets set up avatars to play video games, take exercise classes and participate in conference calls, although initially, the digital outfits will be available only on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger."

NowMusk has clarified thatlayoffs will affect around 3.5% of Tesla’s overall workforce, adding the actual amount was “not super material.” Musk’s comment came just a few days after two former Tesla employeesfiled a lawsuit alleging the electric car maker breached U.S. labor laws in its decision to carry out a “mass layoff” as the company did not provide advance notice of the job cuts. However, Musk’s clarification also sparks confusion following the statement he made at an event hosted by Bloomberg on Tuesday. During the event, Musk said Tesla would reduce its salaried workforce by 10% in the next three months, while at the same time growing the number of hourly employees. In the memo early this month, Musk reportedly said he has a “super bad feeling” about the economy andwanted to cut 10% of jobs, according to a report from Reuters,citing an internal email written by the Tesla CEO. But in a follow-up email to Tesla staff obtained by CNBC, Musk clarified the company will be reducing its salaried headcount by 10% and increasing its hourly staffing. Based on his follow-up email, it appears that Tesla will still lay off 10% of its workforce while hiring 6.5% of hourly employees, equating to an overall 3.5% job cut. In a statement on Tuesday, Musk also explains thatsalaried workers account for about two-thirds of Tesla employees, adding thatTesla’s layoff announcement would affect around 3.5% of its overall workforce. “A year from now, I think our head count will be higher in both salaried and obviously in hourly,” Musk said. Meanwhile, on Sunday, two former Tesla employees sued Tesla forfailing to adhere to federal laws on mass layoffs that require a 60-day notification period under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, according to the lawsuit. “Tesla has simply notified the employees that their terminations would be effective immediately,” the complaint said."

2022.6.22,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/22/fintech-startup-vergo-bags-4-1-million-seed-funding-provide-banking-architects-designers-home-builders/,"The U.S. construction sector was valued at around $1.36 trillion as of the end of 2020 and was expected to decline further in the next year, according to data from Statista. If you add the interior design industry, the combined market will reach about $1.4 trillion. Considering this massive market size, it’s surprising that the sector doesn’t have a dedicated banking service. But that’s about to change. Enter Vergo, a New York-based neobank startup that’s on a mission to provide banking specially built for interior designers, architects, contractors, and home builders. Currently, the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) community constitutes one of the largest business communities in the world, with over $1 trillion in annual payment flows in the US alone. At its core, Vergo blends elements of banking with project management and accounting software functionsto serve the specific needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in the AEC community. The startup alsooffers a debit account, cashback card, and invoice management software with no annual fees or credit checks. The story of Vergo started way back in a cramped East Village apartment.Vergo CEO and co-founder Rich Kane fell upon the idea for the company after building side hustles in this industry including an interior design studio and carpentry business which got wiped out during Covid.Kane traced back the founding of the startup to various “pain points” he experienced managing project transactions and cash flow while running his invoice-based “side hustles”. Reflective on the pain points he experienced running these businesses, Kane realized that it all came back to managing the finances of each project and how many hours were wasted each week reconciling bank statements, invoices, returns, and receipts to figure out how much of the client’s budget had been used so he could respond to his client’s demanding questions. As his businesses grew and won more projects, the problems intensified with no clear path to scaling without hiring an army of project managers. To further grow its platform, Vergo announced it has raised$4.1 million in a seed round led by CRV with participation from Nine Four Ventures and Forum Ventures. Notable angel investors also include celebrity interior designer Kelly Wearstler, Thumbtack co-founder Sander Daniels, Alloy co-founder Laura Spiekerman and Built founder, Chase Gilbert. Vergo will use the new capital injection to build a financial platform for businesses in the home building and renovation industry. The startup will also use the funding proceeds toscale up the product and operations team in the U.S. and the engineering team in Mexico. As a result of the news on Friday that Brex was breaking with SMBs, Vergo saw an increase of 500% increase in deposits primarily from businesses in the construction industry, which Brex had been targeting a lot over the past year. Getting paid by clients on time, paying contractors, managing invoices, and paying sales taxes were just some of the many other constant daily headaches which made running businesses in this industry hard. In early 2021, Kane made the decision to leave JPMorgan where he was a Senior Vice President in the Technology Strategy team, and partnered with his Mexico City-based co-founder Einar Hohenstein to build Vergo. Vergo said it currently has more than 5,000 businesses on its waitlist. The startup also just launched its checking account, which includes virtual project cards and a modern mobile banking app that lets users tag transactions and payments to get a real-time view of a project’s finances for the first time ever. There are no credit checks to apply, no minimum balance, and no fees on Checks, ACH, and wires. The project cards also have a unique cashback program with extra points when spending on building supplies, furniture, gas, and equipment rentals. Later this year Vergo will also be launching a credit card followed by more project management tools like intelligent invoicing. “I thought I was the only one doing it all wrong and that everyone else must have been using better software or processes. After months of speaking to hundreds of other business owners in the industry though, I realized I was not alone and that everyone else experienced the same problems with some even going bankrupt from struggling to manage project finances,” Kane says. “Effective financial management of architecture and interior design projects is fundamental to their success,” said Wearstler. “With its capability to streamline this process for all parties involved, Vergo will be an essential tool for architects and designers.” “Vergo is disrupting fintech for the future of home building, renovation and design,” said James Green, general partner, CRV. “Vergo represents the growth of vertical SaaS as we see more companies providing industry-specific solutions, typically based on the pain points experienced directly by the founder. Rich’s deep understanding and personal experience in identifying the problem and creating a solution is impressive on its own, but the proof of concept was further validated when we saw he had 3,000 companies on the waiting list in less than seven weeks.” “There are no great tools on the market to help home renovation businesses manage their finances,” states Sander Daniels, co-founder of Thumbtack, one of the largest marketplaces for home renovation professionals in the U.S. “The opportunity to build something great for these businesses is enormous. I’m excited to see the Vergo team going after this huge opportunity with their financial platform.”"

On the surface, the platform is also known for its #hastags and 280-character limit for messages.But, what most Twitter users don’t know is thatTwitter has also been hiring an alarming number of FBI agents, spies, and former intel officials to work for the company. According to an investigation conducted by MintPress News Senior staff writer Alan McLeod, many former FBI officials hold influential roles within Twitter.For example, McLeod noted that in 2020, Matthew W. left a 15-year career as an intelligence program manager at the FBI to take up the post of senior director of product trust at Twitter. Afterstudying a number of employment and recruitment websites, McLeod found that Twitter has, “in recent years, recruited dozens of individuals from the national security state to work in the fields of security, trust, safety, and content.” Matthew W. is not the only former FBI agent working for the tech giant.MintPress also found that another23-year FBI supervisory special agentPatrick G.is now head of corporate security. That’s not all. Twitter’s director of insider risk and security investigations, Bruce A., was recruited from his role as a supervisory special agent at the bureau. According toMcLeod, citing his resume, Bruce notes that “at the FBI he held “[v]arious intelligence and law enforcement roles in the US, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East” and was a “human intelligence and counterintelligence regional specialist.” (On employment sites such as LinkedIn, many users choose not to reveal their full names.)” Surprisingly, Twitter doesn’t seem to hide its hiring practices and the role the FBI plays in allowing the agencyin regulating the global dissemination of information on its platform. AsMintPress further noted, in September 2020, Twitter put out astatementthanking the federal agency. “We wish to express our gratitude to the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force for their close collaboration and continued support of our work to protect the public conversation at this critical time,” the statement read. It also appears the hiring is already paying off for Twitter. On October 1, 2020, the social giant said in a tweet that the FBI was feeding it intelligence and that it was complying with their requests for deletion of accounts. “Based on intel provided by the FBI, last night we removed approximately 130 accounts that appeared to originate in Iran. They were attempting to disrupt the public conversation during the first 2020 U.S. Presidential Debate,” Twitter’s safety team tweeted. Based on intel provided by the @FBI, last night we removed approximately 130 accounts that appeared to originate in Iran. They were attempting to disrupt the public conversation during the first 2020 US Presidential Debate. — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 1, 2020  The news of Twitter’s mass hiring of former FBI agents was also picked up by the Hills. In the video below, The Hilldiscusses McLeod’s investigation into Twitter’s recruitment from the U.S. national security state, including the FBI, and CIA.  Meanwhile, Matthew, Patrick, and Bruce are just three of the many former FBI agents Twitter has hired in recent years. MintPress also noted thatin 2019, Dawn Burton (the former director of Washington operations for Lockheed Martin) was poached from her job as senior innovation advisor to the director at the FBI to become senior director of strategy and operations for legal, public policy, trust and safety at Twitter. A year later, Karen Walsh went straight from 21 years at the bureau to becoming director of corporate resilience at the silicon valley giant. Twitter’s deputy general counsel and vice president of legal, Jim Baker, also spent four years at the FBI between 2014 and 2018, where his resumé notes he rose to the role of senior strategic advisor."

2022.6.22,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/22/distinguish-crypto-layer-2-scaling-solutions/,"Blockchain technology, despite its rising popularity, has a few shortcomings that are pulling it back from achieving mainstream success. For instance, blockchains aren’t as scalable as their “centralized” counterparts. Blockchains often run into scalability issues depending on the network congestion, leading to slow throughput and outrageous network fees. Recently, there have been many instances where second-generation layer-1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum have faced recurring network outages. The third generation of blockchains hasn’t fared any better. Solana, Binance Chain, and many other L1 chains are increasingly facing outages and skyrocketing gas fees due to the growing number of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and P2E games. Blockchain developers started working on layer-2 (L2) solutions to solve scalability issues. To help existing L1 chains address scalability challenges without compromising decentralization and security, L2 scaling solutions are becoming increasingly popular in crypto, primarily because they process transactions off the L1 mainnet. By processing transactions on a chain other than the mainnet, L2 solutions enable developers to offer users faster throughput and reduced network fees. Several L2 scaling solutions are available – some built for the Ethereum network and some for the broader ecosystem. Developers now can choose from various options, including sidechains, parachains, subnets, supernets, state channels, and Rollups. But how does one decide which L2 solution best suits their project needs? Each blockchain project has a different goal and intends to serve a unique segment of consumers. Accordingly, each L2 scaling solution is designed to meet specific needs. Simply put, Rollups aren’t the same as subnets, sidechains are different from state channels, and so on. While having many options is great, it also leads to situations where it becomes increasingly challenging to pick one. According to the Ethereum Foundation, Rollups are the most preferred option by developers building on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, subnets are gaining traction among Web3 projects, while a growing number of P2E gaming projects are choosing sidechains as their go-to option. To determine which L2 scalability solution best suits a project, take a closer look at how Rollups stack up against custom chains. L2 scaling solutions usually bundle compressed off-chain transactions into a single order on the L1 mainnet. In this context, L2 solutions essentially play the role of processing all transactions outside of the main chain. It performs the computational tasks while the L1 mainnet does the validation. Two types of Rollups are built for the Ethereum network – they operate similarly but are vastly different in terms of security. First up, we have Optimistic Rollups. This L2 solution sits in parallel with Ethereum’s mainnet layer. Compared to its counterpart, Optimistic Rollups offer greater ease of use. They offer full EVM compatibility, enabling developers to move their existing dApps and protocols without making any significant changes in the source code. Ethereum Foundation, in its recent report, suggested that by implementing Optimistic Rollups, developers can achieve 10x to 100x scalability. Besides, Optimistic Rollups allow developers to access the same features as they would have if they deployed their dApp on the Ethereum mainnet. When using optimistic rollups, all transactions are assumed to be valid and posted to the base layer without further verification. Due to its ease of use and EVM compatibility, many DeFi projects are using Optimistic Rollups. In comparison, Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups offer faster throughput, more scalability, and meager gas costs. The ZK-Rollup generates cryptographic proofs of transactions and posts them on the Layer-1 mainnet as a “validity proof.” Transactions completed with ZK Rollup solutions take less than ten minutes, unlike Optimistic Rollup’s seven days. That said, most of the features of ZK Rollups, such as EVM compatibility, are currently under development. Hence, for now, the functionality of ZK Rollups is limited chiefly to token transfers and exchanges. According to Bybit’s latest research, “With the maturation of Optimistic Rollups, most large DeFi projects have already adopted this solution as needed. However, the one-week waiting period often underwhelms new users in the space. As an alternative, when considering GameFi Scalability, NFT marketplaces, and web3 applications, ZK-Rollups could be a possible solution to networks that demand higher throughput and cheaper transaction fees.” Custom chains, such as subnets, supernets, and sidechains, are becoming increasingly popular among web3 developers. A myriad of Web3 games, NFT marketplaces, DeFi protocols, and GameFi projects are opting for sidechains, and subnets are their go-to option, especially the huge projects that require their chains (and customization) to avoid congesting the L1 mainnet. For instance, Avalanche’s subnet has positioned itself as the hotspot for web3 games. The GameFi ecosystem on Avalanche is skyrocketing, thanks to its subnets that scale horizontally. Promising games like Crabada, DeFi Kingdoms, and Caste Crush leverage Avalanche subnets to increase their throughput while ensuring near-zero gas fees. Likewise, Polygon’s sidechain also hosts many Web3 games, further underscoring the demand for L2 scaling solutions, especially for DeFi, Web3, and NFT projects. Based on the above, here’s a feature-based comparison of the available L2 scaling solutions:"
2022.6.22,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/22/germany-is-going-back-to-burning-coal-after-spending-billions-on-renewable-energy/,"Coal is back from the dead in Germany as the country grapples with the fallout of economic sanctions it imposed on Russia. According to reports from major media outlets,Germany is now “planning to fire up coal plants as Russia throttles gas supplies,” CNBC reported. This is not the first time Germany has resorted to coal. As we reported in the winter of 2021, the country turned backto ‘dirty’ coal and natural gas as millions of its solar panels are blanketed in snow and ice.For many years, Germany has been held up as the world’s wind and solar capital. But 2021 deadly winter put a strain on Germany’s Energiewende program and the country has to be rescued by, you guessed it, “dirty” fossil fuels. Energiewende is a German word for ‘”energy transition.”Energiewende is a policy launched by the German government in 2000 to decarbonize its primary energy supply. Depending on whom you ask, the program has been praised by many environmentalists and others called it a failure. In 2000 when the program was first launched, 6.6 percent of Germany’s electricity came from renewable sources such as solar and wind. In 2019, almost two decades later, the share reached 41.1 percent. That’s where the good news end. In 2000,Germany had an installed capacity of 121 gigawatts with 577 terawatt-hours generated, which is 54 percent as much as it theoretically could have done (that is, 54 percent was its capacity factor). But in 2019, the country only produced a meager 5 percent more (607 TWh). According to CleanEnergyWire, the then Germany’s economy and energy minister, Peter Altmaier,caused a stir in 2013when “he said during his time as environment minister that “the costs of the Energiewende and of the transformation of our energy supply could add up to around one trillion euros by the end of the 2030s” without policies in place to lower the costs. He explained that legal commitments to support renewable energy alone would add up to about 680 billion euros by 2022.” Fast forward two decades later, Germany has now found itself in a dire situation asthe country told its citizens to start working from home and avoid using cars to reduce energy consumption.In a statement, Germany’s Federal Vice-Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habecksuggested thatGermans could work from home at least“one or two days a week on a voluntary basis for the time being.” For decades, Germany, like the rest of the European Union (EU), has aggressively pursued a clean energy future as it plans to end its reliance on fossil fuels, but the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has highlighted the shortalls of renewables. For example,theEU currently gets about 40% of all its energy from Russia, including 41.1% of its gas supply even with billions of dollars of investment spent on renewable energy. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has led to the deteriorating gas market situation for Europe’s largest economy. Germany said the situation means it must limit the use of natural gas for electricity production and burn more coal for a “transitional period.” Over the weekend, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck also warned that the situation is going to be “really tight in winter” without precautionary measures to prevent a supply shortage. “That’s bitter, but it’s almost necessary in this situation to reduce gas consumption. We must and we will do everything we can to store as much gas as possible in summer and autumn,” the Green Party’s Habeck said in a statement, according to a translation. “The gas storage tanks must be full in winter. That has top priority,” he added. According to Business Insider,“Germany’s decision to turn back to coal power, which is highly carbon-intensive, underscores how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent surge in energy prices is threatening governments’ climate policies.” In 2020, the German parliament passed a law to phase out the use of coal entirely by 2038, giving the country only 16 years more years to get rid of the dirty fossil fuel. Here’s how Joseph Brown sums up Germany’s decision “in 4 easy steps.” How Germany went “green” in 4 easy steps  1. Shut down clean nuclear 2. Move to unreliable wind/solar 2. Become reliant on Russian natural gas 3. Fire up dirty coal again pic.twitter.com/Jf8XsSK4rg — Joseph Brown (@heresyfinancial) June 21, 2022"

To date, FalconX has now raised more than $430 million in total funding, making it one of the most valuable crypto prime brokerages in the world. But not all the funds will go to the company’s coffers as some investors also sold an undisclosed stake in FalconX. The company will use some of the funding proceeds toincrease its workforce by 30% and add 55 new employees to the company. It also plans to use the new cash infusion for new acquisitions, technology, and data analytics, expanding its services to institutions from trading execution, credit, and prime brokerage, FalconX CEO Yarlagadda said. “Over the next 12 to 18 months, we do expect a very volatile market. And, given that volatility, we see very strong opportunities for acquisitions,” Yarlagadda told Reuters. FalconXis a Silicon Valley-basedcryptocurrency brokerage and digital asset trading platform that uses data science to provide institutions with trading, credit, and clearing. FalconX was founded in 2018 by Raghu Yarlagadda and Prabhakar Reddy. Raghu is an engineer and an entrepreneur.

2022.6.23,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/23/5-benefits-cryptocurrency-igaming-sports-betting-industry/,"In 2021, the US sports betting industryset a new record as the highest-grossing year ever, reaching $53 billion in revenue, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA). Thanks to the US Supreme Court overturning the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act which permitted states to decide for themselves on legalizing sports betting,the sports betting industry also recorded $57.2 billion in handle — an insider’s term for the amount of money wagered.Other forecasts also estimate that the revenue from iGaming and the sports betting industry is expected to increase in the coming years. But that’s not all. The Supreme Court ruling on sports bettingalso opened up new opportunities in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.For many years,Blockchain technologies have had significant impacts on the financial, trading, fashion and transport, and construction industries. But that’s about to change with the evolution of blockchain games. With the popularity of cryptocurrency and NFT play-to-earn games, running the best online casino is now easy and so convenient compared to a few years ago. In this piece, we take a look at the 5 benefits of cryptocurrency in the iGaming, gambling, and sports betting industry. https://unsplash.com/photos/vBCVcWUyvyM One of the biggest benefits of cryptocurrency in the gambling industry is that it makes it much more convenient and safe for the player and the casino itself. It is much safer than other traditional payment methods because it uses encryption to verify all the transactions. It basically means that advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting data between wallets and public ledgers. Many players choose cryptocurrency gambling because of the protection, privacy, and efficiency it offers. Another benefit of crypto to the gambling industry is that it maintains records and eliminates the need for player accounts. So sensitive information will be private. Cryptocurrency is a perfect match for gambling, especially online gambling. It makes it much easier for clients to play from their mobile devices and browsers. All that the players need is a currency network and an internet connection. The digital currency has the ability and power to eliminate risk and offers ease of transfer of assets. Crypto casinos deal directly with digital currency for e-sport betting, slots, and poker games. They can also offer rewards and bonuses using the same cryptocurrency. It provides a safe, secure, fast, and relaxed environment for handling transactions, and explains an increase in participation in online gambling sites and casinos. https://unsplash.com/photos/gC_aoAjQl2Q With more and more people switching over to doing most of their activities online, it is no surprise that more and more gambling clients are moving online as well. When players win, the proceeds are transferred to personal e-wallets and remain a cryptocurrency token. Alternatively, they can convert their winnings from crypto into legal tender. Importantly, cryptocurrency transfers do not involve other financial institutions such as banks but instead lower transaction charges. This is also a great benefit that players can enjoy while enjoying online gambling. There are multiple loyalty programs, and you can earn a lot of special points and treats while playing your favorite games. It does not matter whether you are casual or a high roller; there will definitely be a rewards program that will fit your needs. You can even earn incentives and real money by participating in a gambling site’s loyalty program. You can earn casino loyalty points, freebies, and items that may all be yours when you make a deposit and play. Depending on how much money you deposit and how much you wager, you will receive various rewards. The following are all the things you can enjoy and experience when you participate in a loyalty program. https://unsplash.com/photos/V3qzwMY2ak0 One of the most significant advantages of cryptocurrency is its decentralized nature. This means your money is sent directly from person to person with no intermediary in the process. This ends up being much faster and more efficient than when your money goes through a central authority like a bank or government. Not only is this process safer and faster, but it is also cheaper! The payment of these transactions is significantly lower than traditional methods. Another upside to gambling with cryptocurrency is that you can do it anywhere in the world, so if you are not close to a racetrack or a casino, it is no issue. So, as you can see, there are so many benefits to gambling with cryptocurrency. These benefits are the reason we can see the switch from traditional methods to cryptocurrency in the gambling industry. The fact that it is secure, easy, decentralized, and offers a bunch of extra treats and rewards makes it super appealing for consumers. It doesn’t matter where you are in the world. The lower costs are also a great benefit and allow more people to enjoy their favorite casino games. So, if you were still unsure about the process, the benefits, and the impact that cryptocurrency has on the overall gambling experience, this article might have made things clearer."

2022.6.23,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/23/google-says-apple-android-phones-hacked-italian-spyware/,"Google announced on Thursday that Appleand Android smartphones in Italy and Kazakhstan were hacked by an Italian company’s hacking tools.According to the report, the tech giant said that Milan-based RCS Lab, whose website claims European law enforcement agencies as clients, developed tools to spy on private messages and contacts of the targeted devices, Reuters reported. Google’s findings on RCS Lab come less than a year afterUS officials’ phones were hacked by Israeli NSO Group spyware. At least nine iPhones of US state department officials were hacked using the Israeli startup spyware. In a statement on its website,Google said that it “has been tracking the activities of commercial spyware vendors for years, and taking steps to protect people.”In 2021, Google also added that itsThreat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered seven of the nine zero-day vulnerabilities that fall into developed by commercial providers and sold to and used by government-backed actors categories. Google said its TAG “is actively tracking more than 30 vendors with varying levels of sophistication and public exposure selling exploits or surveillance capabilities to government-backed actors.” “Today, alongside Google’s Project Zero, we are detailing capabilities we attribute to RCS Labs, an Italian vendor that uses a combination of tactics, including atypical drive-by downloads as initial infection vectors, to target mobile users on both iOS and Android. We have identified victims located in Italy and Kazakhstan,” Google said in its report. Google also added that it had taken steps to protect users of its Android operating system and alerted them about the spyware. Below is the full detail of the hack. All campaigns TAG observed originated with a unique link sent to the target. Once clicked, the page attempted to get the user to download and install a malicious application on either Android or iOS. In some cases, we believe the actors worked with the target’s ISP to disable the target’s mobile data connectivity. Once disabled, the attacker would send a malicious link via SMS asking the target to install an application to recover their data connectivity. We believe this is the reason why most of the applications masqueraded as mobile carrier applications. When ISP involvement is not possible, applications are masqueraded as messaging applications. An example screenshot from one of the attacker-controlled sites, www.fb-techsupport[.]com. The page, in Italian, asks the user to install one of these applications in order to recover their account. Looking at the code of the page, we can see that only the WhatsApp download links are pointing to attacker controlled content for Android and iOS users. To distribute the iOS application, attackers simply followed Apple instructions on how todistribute proprietary in-house apps to Apple devicesand used the itms-services protocol with the following manifest file and using com.ios.Carrier as the identifier. The resulting application is signed with a certificate from a company named 3-1 Mobile SRL (Developer ID: 58UP7GFWAA). The certificate satisfies all of the iOS code signing requirements on any iOS devices because the company was enrolled in theApple Developer Enterprise Program. These apps still run inside the iOS app sandbox and are subject to the exact same technical privacy and security enforcement mechanisms (e.g. code side loading) as any App Store apps. They can, however, be sideloaded on any device and don’t need to be installed via the App Store. We do not believe the apps were ever available on the App Store. The app is broken up into multiple parts. It contains a generic privilege escalation exploit wrapper which is used by six different exploits. It also contains a minimalist agent capable of exfiltrating interesting files from the device, such as the Whatsapp database.”"

Just a few weeks before the collapse, the Tron DAO Reserve decided to launch Tron’s USDD, another algorithmic stablecoinsimilar to the terraUSD that was pegged to $1. Fast forward a month later, Tron’s USDD is now struggling to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar. Over the weekend,USDD plunged as low as 93 cents.USDD has since bounced back and was trading at around 97 centsas of Wednesday. The carnage didn’t end there, TRON coin(TRX) has also fallen by 35% since its peak at the end of May.The situation has led many to say that the controversial stablecoin may suffer the same fate asterraUSD. The Tron DAO Reserve, the community which oversees and manages the stablecoin, said in a post on Twitter that a certain degree of volatility in USDD’s price was to be expected given its “decentralized” nature. Italso took to Twitter to reassure investors. “1. Is USDD depegged?No. USDD is a decentralized stablecoin that depends on an on-chain mechanism & collateralized assets, unlike centralized stablecoin e.x. USDC, which is attached to USD in a very close spread by banking mint and redemption,” TRON DAO Reserve tweeted. (1/8) Q&A about #USDD 1. Is USDD depegged? No. USDD is a decentralized stablecoin that depends on an on-chain mechanism & collateralized assets, unlike centralized stablecoin e.x. USDC, which is attached to USD in a very close spread by banking mint and redemption. — TRON DAO Reserve (@trondaoreserve) June 17, 2022  “Certain % of volatility is unavoidable,” the organization tweeted last week. “Currently, the market volatility rate is within +- 3%, an acceptable range. We will watch the market very closely and act accordingly,”TRON DAO Reserve said. Launched in early May,Unlike other stablecoins that sit on massive cash and other cash-like assets,USDD runs a complex algorithm — combined with a related token called TRON — to maintain a one-to-one peg to the US dollar. Meanwhile, the demise of the controversial stablecoin venture Terra has resulted in a meltdown in the crypto market, which erasedbillions of dollarsin value in a single day. Despite LUNA crash,TRON founder Justin Sun has relentlessly been promoting USDD, adding that LUNA’s failure was not caused byalgorithmic stablecoins. Instead, he said TRON’s USSD solves some of LUNA’s problems. Ina Zoom interview,Sun said: “I still believe in algorithmic stablecoins. I think the failure of LUNA was not because algorithmic stablecoins are not viable or are not doable…We can’t blame the algorithm just because LUNA failed.” He also added: “When USDD’s price is lower than 1 USD, users and arbitrageurs can send 1 USDD to the system and receive 1 USD worth of TRX. When USDD’s price is higher than 1 USD, users and arbitrageurs can send 1 USD worth of TRX to the decentralized system and receive 1 USDD.”"

The hack is the latest in a series ofmajor heists in the world of decentralized finance (DeFI).The announcement comes just three months afterhackers stole $615M in the largest crypto heist from blockchain startup Ronin. While details of the attacks are still sketchy, Harmony, the crypto startup and developers behind Horizon, said they first identified the theft Wednesday morning. The company said it has singled out an individual account it believes was responsible for the hack. In a tweet late Wednesday, Harmony said: “We have begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds.” Then in a follow-up tweet on Thursday, the startup said its “team has identified a theft occurring this morning on the Horizon bridge amounting to approx. $100MM and “have begun working with national authorities and forensic specialists to identify the culprit and retrieve the stolen funds.” “1/ The Harmony team has identified a theft occurring this morning on the Horizon bridge amounting to approx. $100MM.

2022.6.24,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/24/video-game-startups-expected-register-success-2022-beyond/,"As well as accessing social media tools like Twitter and utilizing services such as Netflix, gaming is a favored entertainment option in the modern world. In fact, gaming has always been a go-to product for many of us, except the all-around package on offer in 2022 has reached new heights. As such, the image of a stereotypical gamer has certainly changed, with more and more people around the world discovering the benefits of gaming, perhaps through a sophisticated console machine or by accessing an array of games as and when it suits them using a smartphone. As a result of gaming’s evident growth, the video game industry is now bigger than the movie and music industries combined and also record a staggering $56.9 billion in salesper year. It’s expected to grow further to$293 billion by 2027, too. Alongside the manufacturers of hugely powerful console machines and gaming smartphones, other factors have also contributed a great deal to the overall success of the industry. From online casinos teaming up with leading games developers and using the expertise of a gaming mathematician and writer, such as Michael Shackleford, to a selection of video games start-ups that are breaking the space with innovative gaming products in an attempt to overtake the likes of Niantic’s augmented reality tool, this particular entertainment category features some truly impressive innovators. In fact, some notable start-ups are expected to contribute more to the gaming space in 2022 and beyond. Let’s take a look at some of them below. Founded in 2019, Multiverse is a respected name in the tabletop gaming sphere. Although it isn’t completely ready yet and will come out at some point this year, it’s a company that is expected to explode onto the scene further due to an interactive platform that will allow gamers to build their own games. Alongside Multiverse’s other success stories, its interactive platform could achieve global success. A UK-based start-up, Merge Games specifically deals with indie games developers and assists them in the creation of certain titles. Operating out of Manchester, this particular company boasts a team of respected developers that have previously worked on some of the industry’s biggest projects. After being founded in 2010, Merge Games has earned a solid reputation for itself after collaborating with some of the leading indie game providers around.  (Image via https://twitter.com/FortniteGame) Although the company has been around since 1991, Epic Games has reached new heights in recent years, mainly thanks to Fortnite. One of the biggest video games ever made, the American start-up is behind it and has amassed earnings of up to $5.5 billion as a result. Epic Games is a company to follow closely in 2022 in particular, largely because of its plans for the creation of the largest metaverse project ever, with $1 billion in funding already behind it. Based in Singapore, Epik Prime works with reputable video game developers to provide a range of leading titles to global audiences. The Nintendo-backed start-up is working with some of the biggest and best names in the game, with over 250 companies being incredibly happy with Epik Prime’s services. Since being founded in 2018, it’s an ambitious start-up that has continued to illustrate growth on a yearly basis. Behind one of the most successful gaming titles ever, it probably comes as no surprise to learn that PUBG Corporation is a booming start-up. The South Korean company is responsible for a game that has over 400M registered users at the time of writing, as well as working with some of the industry’s major players."
2022.6.25,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.6.25,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.6.25,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

2022.6.26,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.6.26,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.6.26,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate. Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022  Another analysis conducted by Israeli cybersecurity company CHEQ back in May found that12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.“Up to 12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.”CHEQ found that11.71% of all website visits originating from Twitter were by bots or fake users.

But investments in minority and female-led startups still are still lagging behind. The disparity in funding to minority startups is at an all-time high. In the last five years, Black and Latinx founders have raised just 2.4 percent of total venture capital invested, according to data from CrunchBase. But that’s changing as big companies and minority-owned venture capital firms stepped up to reverse the trend. As we reported in 2020, for instance,Citi Grouplaunched a $150 million Citi Impact Fund equity investments in “double bottom line” startups and private sector companieswith an emphasis on women and minority entrepreneurs. A year earlier,Harlem Capital closed a $40 million Inaugural Fund to invest in minority and women founders in the U.S.Citi Group andHarlem Capital are not alone. Today,MaC Venture Capital, a Los Angeles and Silicon Valley-based seed-stage venture capital firm, announced it hassecured $203 million for its second fund, nearly doubling the $110M raised in its seed-stage fund. MaC Venture Capital will use Fund II capital to double down on its cultural investment framework, which has successfully supported technology startups who are shaping culture, increasing access and resources to underserved communities, and meeting consumer and industry needs. Founded in 2019 by four founding general partners Adrian Fenty, Charles King, Marlon Nichols, and Michael Palank,MaC Venture Capitalis amajority Black-owned VC firmthat invests in technology startups leveraging shifts in cultural trends and behaviors. MaC Venture Capital is the result of a 2019 merger between Cross Culture Ventures, co-founded by Nichols, and M Ventures, co-founded by Fenty, King, and Palank.The firm is led by a team with diverse backgrounds in technology, business, politics, entertainment, and finance. Since their seed-stage fund, the firm has since expanded to include new partners Haley Farnsworth and Zhenni Liu, whose collective consulting experiences across retail, healthcare, and media industries support the firm’s vision to identify and invest in companies who look to serve the 99% by increasing access to opportunities and resources. As of the launch of the seed-stage fund, MaC Venture Capital has invested in 50 companies, with top performers including Pipe, Edge Delta, Stoke, Zigazoo, Epsilon3 and Spartan Radar. Prior to forming MaC Venture Capital, the four founders have also collectively invested in over 135 companies, including those with notable exits, such as Gimlet Media and Truebill. “Nearly doubling our seed-stage funding is incredibly validating and showcases how investors believe in our vision, and see the hard work our team and portfolio companies are putting in every day,” said managing general partner, Adrian Fenty. “We’re supporting the next generation of companies, like Spora Health and Avala, who are bridging gaps in access and opportunities, and our investors are trusting in our cultural investment framework which guides our investment strategies.” As a result of strong portfolio company performance, Fund II investors include repeat and new institutional investors such as Fairview Capital, George Kaiser Family Foundation, Goldman Sachs, ICG Advisors, Illumen Capital, the MacArthur Foundation, Stepstone, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the State of Illinois, and the University of Michigan, among others. “While new investors are integral to helping our firm achieve our vision of increasing access to resources and opportunities, it’s promising to see investors from our first fund return,” said general partner Charles D. King. “These investors believed in our vision from the start, and to have their support once more reflects not only their belief in us but also in our portfolio companies as well.” MaC Venture Capital has seen strong growth and success across its portfolio companies, with 30% of its Fund I portfolio companies raising successful series A in the next round of funding, with $412 million in assets under management, and over $99 million invested across their portfolio since the launch of their first two funds. “The success of our sophomore fund is integral to our goal of building a world-class multigenerational venture capital firm,” said managing general partner Marlon Nichols. “Doubling the size of our first fund will allow us to double the initial investment amount that we deploy to seed-stage companies and allow us to reserve ~$100 million to continue to financially support our strongest portfolio companies. We are also in a position to identify and support more extraordinary founders building novel solutions to overlooked challenges in massive markets. We strive to be the investment innovators our later stage investment peers trust and follow into investment opportunities – this $203M Fund II makes that possible.” According to the firm, 36% of its portfolio companies are led by women founders, and 69% have BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of color) founders. The firm’s investment team embodies the same emphasis on diversity with over half of the team being Black and a quarter are women. “MaC Venture Capital understands establishing diversity in leadership is not only the right thing to do, it’s the most strategic investment strategy, too,” said partner Michael Palank. “We’ve seen study after study show that diverse organizations perform better than less diverse competitors, but we also know supporting diverse leaders results in companies whose solutions are culturally competent and truly meet the needs of underserved communities–because they too are part of those communities.”"

Additionally, the funding commitment enables new product development and global adoption of Unizen, while providing retail and institutional clients with the opportunity to add cryptocurrency to their portfolios easily and efficiently. According to a team statement, the commitment to capital funding will be released on mutually agreed milestone-based and performance-related stages to optimize the utilization of the initial funding. Announced Monday, the capital commitment will help Unizen pioneer the future of the CeDeFi industry, with an aim to become the global leader in providing crypto exchange solutions. The funding will also be used to accelerate the execution of trade aggregation on the platform, offering a faster and cheaper channel for investors to swap their crypto assets. Speaking on the latest capital funding, Sean Noga, CEO of Unizen said,“We are proud to welcome GEM to the Unizen Ecosystem as a potent and strategically aligned growth partner that can support the rapid expansion of the Unizen platform, brand and community.” Launched in 2021 on the Binance Chain ecosystem, Unizen offers users a crypto exchange aggregation platform, supporting cross-chain swaps and interoperability across decentralized applications (DApps). Furthermore, Unizen allows traders the convenience and compliance of centralized exchanges (CEXs) while maintaining the trustlessness and low fees of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), providing users with a seamless trading platform. With the latest funding from GEM, Unizen will improve the features already available while introducing an industry-first functionality of first-party and third-party CEXs and DEXs to meet their clients’ needs. Such are the features that made Unizen the latest company to join GEM’s alternative investment portfolio. Moreover, Unizen’s combination of compliance (mostly on centralized exchanges) and innovation (from DeFi) will provide users with the best offers, reliable performance, and a secure environment for high-volume trading. The funding commitment will also be used to advance Unizen’s innovation and incubation center, ZenX Labs. The center aims to provide CeDeFi projects and DApps on Binance Chain with needed technical solutions, motivation, expertise, and marketing to empower their growth in the wider crypto market. ZenX Labs will also provide the projects with guidance in compliance matters, ensuring each project is in line with regulations. Once the ZenX Labs’ projects take off to a global market base, the projects can choose to reward the native $ZCX token holders benefits to incentivize the Unizen community to join their platform. The token holders will benefit from the growth of incubated projects via the Dynamic Multi-Asset Staking (DMAS), whereby incubated projects could choose to reward the Unizen community once they take off or gain long-term success. In closing, the team statement also announced the addition of the $ZCX token to several exchanges including Unizen, Uniswap, and other centralized exchanges such as Kucoin, Gate, MEX, and BitMart."

At the time, the office ofHer Majesty’s Revenue (HMRC) and Customs fined Kristo Käärmann fined £365,651 (approx. $500,000) for deliberately defaulting on his tax bill. However, the company spokesperson said Kaarmann had submitted his personal tax returns for the 2017/18 tax year late but has since paid what he owed along with “substantial” late filing penalties. Fast forward nine months later,Käärmann is now being investigated by U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)after the UK tax authorities found he failed to pay a tax bill worth about $1 million (over £720,000). Today, Wise released a statement saying the FCA has now opened an investigation into the matter. The UK regulators are looking into whether Kaarmann failed to meet regulatory obligations and standards. The fintech giant also said “its board hired external lawyers to help investigate Kaarmann’s tax violation.” The investigation wrapped up in the fourth quarter of 2021 and its findings were shared with the FCA. David Wells, chair of Wise’s board, said the company’s management takes Kaarmann’s tax default and the FCA probe “very seriously.” “After reviewing the matter late last year the Board required that Kristo take remedial actions, including appointing professional tax advisors to ensure his personal tax matters are appropriately managed,” Wells said. “The Board has also shared details of its own findings, assessment and actions with the FCA and will cooperate fully with the FCA as and when they require, while continuing to support Kristo in his role as CEO.” Formerly calledTransferWise,Wisewas founded 11 years ago by twoEstonian friends Kristo Käärmann and Taavet Hinrikus after their frustration with opaque bank charges on international money transfers.

2022.6.27,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/27/deep-dive-value-proposition-blockchain-technology-global-economy/,"Blockchain technology has often been attributed to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum but there is more than what meets the eye. Unlike in the earlier years, innovators in this space are now exploring beyond the digital asset realm. Most notably, some traditional industries have started integrating blockchain tech to enhance their existing processes. So, what exactly does blockchain have to offer the human race? To answer this question, one has to understand the ongoing developments. While it is undeniable that Bitcoin played a major role in the adoption of blockchain, newer trends such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have created more opportunities. Today, most blockchain users can access a wide range of decentralized services, some of which are proving to be much better than centralized products. However, the knowledge is still limited, given that only a handful of people can actively keep up with the fast-paced nature of crypto innovations. Well, that should not be a hurdle anymore; the next section of this article will highlight four areas where blockchain is making a significant change in the current global economy.  Dating back to the Paleolithic period, the betting market is one of the oldest industries. As per the latest statistics, it is now worth $287 billion, with projections showing it could grow up to $458 billion by 2026. That said, there have been criticisms of the current betting market structure; some proponents argue that its centralized nature is designed to favor the house at the expense of unsuspecting gamblers. What better to eliminate this shortcoming than decentralized ecosystems? That is where blockchain comes in. At the core, blockchain-built betting protocols such as LunaFi introduce decentralized platforms that are governed by the community instead of a third party. This approach eliminates the rogue players who have long been manipulating betting systems to their advantage. Even better, LunaFi’s non-custodial betting DApp ‘Lunabets’ allows users to become the house by providing liquidity to the House Pools. In return, they are rewarded with a share of the profit generated from the house wins. While it may sound like a utopian concept, this pioneer decentralized betting DApp is actually paving the way for a fair and trustless betting market, an issue that seemed unsolvable before the invention of blockchain technology. With the world shifting to digital ecosystems, Intellectual Property (IP) has become a primary facet of this innovation space. Most individuals and corporations are now investing heavily in IP rights; however, things have not been as smooth as expected. There is still a major challenge when it comes to protecting one’s digital property. The question then becomes: how blockchain is solving this shortcoming? As mentioned in the introduction, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are one of the blockchain-oriented niches that is adding value to modern-day markets. More specifically, NFTs have become a reliable tool in the creation of IP-Patented digital assets. For example, the Digital Arms NFT marketplace has acquired exclusive IP rights, enabling users to trade some of the leading digital firearm brands. It is also noteworthy that the unique NFT assets featured on decentralized markets like Digital Arms can be used across a wide range of ecosystems. The most prominent ones include the NFT gaming space, the metaverse, and guild platforms. With such innovations popping up, it has become much easier to purchase IP-patented digital assets, not to mention additional perks such as passive income generation through staking. The stock market has made fortunes for many people within the past century but remains largely inaccessible to a majority of the world’s population. This is because of the centralized infrastructures used to run the market; one has to go through a banker, broker, or investment manager to gain exposure to lucrative financial products. A hurdle that has locked out many potential investors. Thanks to the debut of blockchain tech, humans across the world now have an opportunity to buy tokenized securities (stocks that reside on-chain). To this end, we have decentralized trading protocols such as SOMA.finance, a multi-asset DEX that offers tokenized equities, ETFs, and STOs. The project has also partnered with a U.S licensed brokerage firm dubbed Tritaurian Capital, enabling users to invest within the purview of the SEC and FINRA. Looking at these developments, blockchain’s role in the financial markets cannot be ignored. The likes of SOMA.finance are not only providing an access point to the much-coveted traditional finance products but other blockchain-related opportunities, including decentralized money markets and lending ecosystems. We live in an era where governments have become prone to censorship, from media freedom to asset ownership. The latter is particularly evident in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis where some individuals are facing the wrath of imposed sanctions. While the censorship by centralized governments has been helpful to some extent, it does not sit well with today’s generation, most of whom believe in fully controlling their environments. Blockchain changes the game by introducing non-custodial wallets such as Ambire; ideally, these digital asset storage platforms give users full control over their funds. Contrary to the custodial wallets offered by banks and other financial institutions, non-custodial wallets are free from government intervention. This means that an investor can store their wealth without having to worry about regulatory uncertainties. Furthermore, Ambire’s non-custodial wallet users have access to various decentralized markets, given that the platform is connected to multiple networks (Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, BSC, Fantom, and Arbitrum). Going by the trends, it is likely that futuristic markets will provide users with the option of self-custody. As we can see from the highlighted niches in this article, blockchain tech is not a crypto-only innovation. In fact, there is more potential than what has been discovered; no wonder even the big banks are gradually joining the wave. While it may take some time before the tech goes fully mainstream, it is undoubtedly one of the areas to watch in this decade. It is more than likely than not that the future markets will be built on decentralized infrastructures."
2022.6.28,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/28/tesla-lays-off-hundreds-autopilot-employees-california-closes-san-mateo-office/,"Tesla has laid off hundreds of employees on its Autopilot team and closed its San Mateo office in California, according to a report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The sources told Bloomberg that 200 employees were let go. Affected employees were notified today, “according to the people, who asked not to be identified as discussing private information.” Before the layoff, the teams at the San Mateo office were tasked with assessing customer vehicle data related to the Autopilot driver-assistance features and performing so-called data labeling. The news comes just two weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company was planning to lay off 10% of Tesla’s total workforce due to a “super bad feeling” he has about the economy. The last week, Musk later clarified thatlayoffs will affect around 3.5% of Tesla’s overall workforce, adding the actual amount was “not super material.” Musk’s comment came just a few days after two former Tesla employeesfiled a lawsuit alleging the electric car maker breached U.S. labor laws in its decision to carry out a “mass layoff” as the company did not provide advance notice of the job cuts. However, Musk’s clarification also sparks confusion following the statement he made at an event hosted by Bloomberg on Tuesday. During the event, Musk said Tesla would reduce its salaried workforce by 10% in the next three months, while at the same time growing the number of hourly employees. In the memo early this month, Musk reportedly said he has a “super bad feeling” about the economy andwanted to cut 10% of jobs, according to a report from Reuters,citing an internal email written by the Tesla CEO. But in a follow-up email to Tesla staffobtained by CNBC, Musk clarified the company will be reducing its salaried headcount by 10% and increasing its hourly staffing.

The round was led by PeakSpan Capital, with participation from existing investors TPY Capital, Mindset Ventures, Differential Ventures, SeedIL Ventures, and Magna Capital Partners.The round bringsthe total capital raised by Konnecto to $29M to date. The New York-headquartered, Tel Aviv-based-based startup will use the new cash infusionto expand its data science and engineering teams, as well as invest in expansion of go-to-market infrastructure and headcount to capitalize on the overwhelming demand it is seeing for its platform.In the past six months alone,Konnecto has tripled its customer base and increased revenue significantly in the past six months. Since its inception four years ago,Konnecto has succeeded in creating a new category in marketing technology, prescribing targeted recommendations to increase online sales and optimize marketing ROI.Konnecto currently touts brands including MassMutual, Coca-Cola, eToro, Mercedes Benz, Phillips, and Stella Artois among its customers. Founded in 2018 byDanielle Michaely, Erez Nahom, Hatzav Wolff, and Marni Mandell, Konnecto is designed to help brands and marketers reverse-engineer and understand the entire customer journey across multiple platforms while also enabling them to disrupt competitors’ customer journeys in order to increase market share. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for marketers to determine which touchpoints influence consumers’ purchase decisions along their path to purchase. This challenge has escalated significantly with the ever-changing landscape of data privacy and the sunset of third-party cookies. Organizations are looking for a source of truth on what will drive impact and improve results in the online purchase journey for them against their competitors. Struggling to solve this challenge, marketing teams spend many hours logging into a variety of disparate platforms in the marketing tech stack, analyzing data points that don’t provide them with the next best action that will improve conversions. Marketing leaders do not need more data or SaaS tools; instead, they are demanding insight into what is working, what touchpoints are influential in improving ultimate conversion, and clear prescriptive recommendations on what to do today to drive better results. Konnecto is the first platform that identifies the most impactful vulnerabilities in the full path to purchase that led consumers to convert with competitors. This is done by reverse-engineering consumer journeys that ended up converting with the brand, its competitors or on a marketplace. Konnecto’s platform prescribes highly targeted and actionable recommendations across the entire digital marketing pie. This helps growth and marketing teams quickly focus on informed decisions and execution without the need for integrations across a brand’s broader tech stack. The platform was built without reliance on cookies and with complete compliance with global privacy regulations. “Our investment in Konnecto is part of a long-standing thesis we’ve been developing centered around partnering with businesses that have demonstrated an ability to drive specific, tangible outcomes and significant performance improvement for marketers amidst an incredibly noisy vendor landscape and increasingly uncertain environment related to data privacy and global compliance mandates,” said Matt Melymuka, co-founder & managing partner, PeakSpan Capital. “Macroeconomic pressure is forcing companies to be more efficient as budgets are slashed across the board, while still satisfying an expectation to execute at the highest level and generate attractive and continuously improving performance. That is obviously a tall order. The value that Konnecto’s platform has delivered to large, demanding organizations across the globe is astounding. The company is paving the way in supporting a new approach to value creation for marketing organizations today, shifting focus from reactive monitoring to prescriptive action suggestions. The rapid growth and overall performance Konnecto has demonstrated to date is among the best we’ve ever seen and we’re privileged to partner with the team in this next phase of development and expansion.” “Management teams, boards, and VCs want their companies to stop spending marketing dollars wastefully, while market uncertainty is causing businesses of all sizes to need rapid results while spending less,” said Erez Nahom, Konnecto CEO and co-founder. “Konnecto uniquely addresses rapidly-changing market conditions and the demand they place on enterprises by providing both insight on the touchpoints that move the needle, but also what actions to take to drive conversion – maximizing revenue in a quickly changing market. We look forward to our latest funding helping to scale our product for organizations that look to stop the customer acquisition guessing game and improve their marketing efficiency significantly.”"

We first covered El Salvador in June 2021 after itbecame the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender. A year later, El Salvador’s gamble on Bitcoin isn’t paying off like President Nayib Bukele hoped it would. The country’s hope in bitcoin as the economic salvation has now left the country in more debt. The country is now in need of a lot of cash to meet its upcoming debt payments of more than $1 billion in the next year, CNBC reported. Last year, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who is also Latin America’s youngest president and known to break from the norms, declared Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the United States dollar,however, concern grows as the value of Bitcoin plummetsamid crypto market turmoil. According to CNBC, El Salvador has spent$375 million on the bitcoin rollout, “which includes a $150 million trust designed to convert bitcoin instantly into dollars, $120 million on the $30 bitcoin bonus given to each citizen who downloaded the Chivo wallet, and the roughly $104 million the government has publicly admitted to spending on bitcoin.” Citing Muci, CNBC also reported that these expenses plus the $50 million in unrealized losses on the country’s bitcoin portfolio mean that the country has spent around $425 million on “making bitcoin happen.” According to theWorld Bank, El Salvador has a population of 6.4 million people plus another 1.5 million Salvadorians living abroad.36 percent of El Salvador’s rural population lives in poverty. In addition,El Salvador has the highest homicide rate in the world, with82.84 murdersper 100,000 people. Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States and other countries account for 23 percent of El Salvador’s gross domestic product and benefit about 360,000 households.El Salvador is a largely cash-based economy. 70 percent of its population does not have a bank account.  Nine months after the nationwide rollout of bitcoin, it does not appear to have immediately delivered all the promises. Per CNBC,President Bukele tweeted in January that the country’s crypto app had 4 million users (out of a total population of 6.5 million). However, a report published by the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in April says otherwise. The NBER research, which was based upon a “nationally representative survey” involving 1,800 households, showed that only 20% of those who downloaded the wallet continued to use it after spending the $30 bonus. London-based fintech data analystBoaz Sobrado said, “On the surface, the whole bitcoin thing hasn’t really paid off.In terms of their financial situation, El Salvador is in a very difficult place. They have a lot of bonds that are trading severely discounted.” Sobrado also commented on the bitcoin adoption rate in El Salvador saying:“In terms of actual penetration of bitcoin transactions, it seems to be quite low. There seem to have been issues with regard to the state-issued wallets. Lots of people downloaded it, but it was buggy. It wasn’t really the best user experience.”"

Everyone’s talking about itsince Canada-based tech startupLayerZero Labs built the interoperability protocol LayerZero,a transport layer for messaging that allows smart contracts to easily communicate among many or any blockchains. However,omnichain NFT infrastructure is not complete without NFT tools for creators, developers, and enterprises. That was whyCXIP Labs rolled outHolograph, the omnichain interoperability protocol for minting and bridging non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Today, Holograph announced its integration with LayerZeroto deliver its patented ‘holographic’ bridging solution that seamlessly beams tokens across blockchains with complete data integrity, including persistent smart contract addresses and token IDs. Over the years, the antiquated NFT bridging solutions have created what has been defined as “multichain NFTs” or thedevelopment of NFT on various platforms based on blockchain networks. The problem arises whenan NFT is bridged from one chain to another, the token becomes locked on the origin chain, and an entirely new NFT is minted on the destination chain. In effect, it creates a “wrapped” version of the original NFT that’s comparable to a photocopy of the original artwork, with a different contract address and token ID. Should the wrapped NFT be moved again to a third blockchain, using a different bridge, this would result in yet another synthetic NFT being created. Such NFTs violate their non-fungible properties, complicating the record of ownership and tracing authenticity. Holograph’s first-of-its-kind bridging process addresses this problem by making use of LayerZero’s lightweight cross-chain messaging to enable what they call ‘holographic’ omnichain NFTs. The original token is seamlessly beamed onto a new chain with all of its data left intact, with no wrapping necessary. Holographic bridging reduces the number of transactions required to bridge an NFT, and eliminates the need to manage multiple gas tokens to execute both the origin chain and destination chain transactions. In addition, the holographic bridging unlocks new and exciting use cases. For example, a creator could take advantage of the cheaper transaction costs to mint an NFT on one chain, then easily bridge that token onto another chain with more liquidity, making it easier to sell. It also enables chain-specific NFT properties that can be updated dynamically based on the chain it’s currently located on. That means traders can explore cross-chain NFT arbitrage to try and profit from the slight price difference of NFTs listed on marketplaces across different chains. With Holograph, it becomes possible to create omnichain NFT marketplaces where traders can collect NFTs from many different chains, without needing to acquire the native gas tokens for each one. Commenting on the integrationHolograph CEOJeff Gluck said,“Holograph’s omnichain NFT infrastructure brings exciting new use cases for creators, developers, and enterprises. We are excited to work with Layer Zero’s incredible team to launch our protocol and deliver a giant leap forward in blockchain interoperability.” LayerZero CEOBryan Pellegrino also commented on the partnership saying,“LayerZero is excited to support Holograph as its cross-chain messaging solution. Their Omnichain NFT infrastructure aims to unlock a frictionless NFT user experience, onboarding the next wave of crypto users.” Founded by intellectual property lawyer Jeff Gluck, Jeremy Kerbel, and artist Daniel Arsham,Holograph provides omnichain NFT tooling for creators, developers, and enterprises. Exemplifying the composability of omnichain NFTs, Holograph unlocks NFT interoperability for the entire web3 ecosystem and the power of NFTs in the open metaverse. CXIP Labs is the parent company of Holograph. LayerZero is an Omnichain Interoperability Protocol designed for lightweight messages passing across chains. LayerZero provides authentic and guaranteed message delivery with configurable trustlessness."

EnterCirculor, a London, England-based green tech startupthat helps companies trace products through complex supply chains. Circulor uses blockchain and AI to cut the cost of traceability and due diligence in raw materials supply chains. Its customers include car manufacturers, EV battery manufacturers, commodity traders, and miners who collectively want to pioneer more effective approaches to responsible sourcing. Today,Circulor announced it has raised$25 million in Series B funding to fund expansion, primarily in the United States. The round, which bringCirculor’s fundraising over the last two years to $45 million, was led by early Tesla investor Westly Group and included investments from the venture capital arms of Volvo Cars, Jaguar Land Rover, and BHP Group, the world’s largest listed miner. Founded in 2018by former consultants and colleagues Douglas Johnson-Poensgen, and Veera Johnson,Circular’s software enables companies track CO2 emissions through manufacturing and shipping, monitor if recycling is being carried out responsibly, or make sure the cobalt inside a battery is not the product of child labor. Some of Circulor’s notable customers includeVolvo Cars, which uses Ciculor to trace the cobalt used in the XC40 Recharge, its first fully electric car. Polestar also uses Circulor to assess the environmental and human rights risks behind sourcing nickel, lithium, and mica for its high-performance electric cars. Its other customers such asVulcan Energy Resources uses the startup’s supply chain traceability solutions to track the production and embedded carbon of lithium.BHP also used Circulor in projects to trace certain commodities across its value chain, including CO2 footprint.

This scenario may sound crazy to an average investor but not to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor. In February of last year, Saylor told CNBC that he “sees bitcoin’s market value reaching $100 trillion one day.” The hope of bitcoin reaching trillions of dollars valuation someday is probably what’s causing Saylor to be bullish on bitcoin.

Then take all your time, figure out how to borrow more money to buy more bitcoin. Then take all your time and figure out what you can sell to buy bitcoin. And if you absolutely love the thing, that you don’t want to sell it, go mortgage your house and buy bitcoin with it. And if you’ve got a business that you love because your family works for the business and it’s in your family for 37 years, and you can’t bear to sell it, mortgage it, finance it, and convert the proceeds into the hardest money on earth, which is bitcoin,” Saylor told the host.

Since then, the Centrifuge team continues to push boundaries and provide tools to help DeFi users. Today,Centrifuge announced the launch of Centrifuge Connectors – a cross-chain solution that melds the Real-World Asset (RWA) market with the fragmented decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. With Centrifuge Connectors, investors and borrowers can access liquidity from multiple DeFi protocols without depending on third-party integrations. For the first time, investors can seamlessly add liquidity to their preferred Centrifuge pool directly from any supported chain – without first bridging their assets to the Centrifuge chain. Connectors is a hybrid solution that combines some of the best features of a bridge and fork simultaneously. It offers simple integrations and low governance overheads, while providing greater composability with pooled and split liquidity. Ava Labs (the primary developers of the Avalanche blockchain), Moonbeam, and Nomad share Centrifuge’s vision of a multichain DeFi ecosystem and are the inaugural partners for the new cross-chain solution. Connectors use Nomad Bridge’s cross-chain functionality as its underlying infrastructure, harnessing its security and efficiency to natively bridge to multiple blockchains. The product will be available publicly later this year, with more protocol integrations to be announced in the coming months. In a statement, Centrifuge Co-Founder and CEOLucas Vogelsang said: “Centrifuge believes in the multi-chain future of DeFi. Today, we’re announcing Centrifuge Connecters, a hybrid cross-chain solution that combines the speed and efficiency of a bridge with the native experience of a protocol fork.” Vogelsang added, “We’re excited to pioneer this novel concept with Avalanche, Moonbeam, and Nomad as our inaugural partners – and are thrilled to bring Centrifuge assets into more DeFi protocols through Connectors in the coming months.” The launch of Connectors is another step forward by Centrifuge towards an open, transparent, and accessible financial world. “In the multi-chain world, there are lots of novel and useful cross-chain applications that require interoperability (one of which is RWAs). That’s why we’re excited for Nomad to help power Connectors and assist Centrifuge in achieving it’s mission to bring on-chain liquidity to RWAs.,” saidDanny Organ, Nomad Marketing Lead. Centrifuge Connectors employ a set of Solidity smart contracts that can be readily deployed on top of any EVM-compatible bridge to transfer KYC-ed and permissioned Centrifuge pool tokens to users across multiple chains. It also allows users to directly withdraw or invest into a pool using the native stablecoin of the target chain. Pool liquidation mechanisms can also be enabled for efficient deployment across different chains. Connectors provide users with a fully-native experience across supported ecosystems – including MakerDAO, Aave, Moonbeam, and Avalanche. By expanding access to liquidity outside of the native protocol, Centrifuge allows DeFi users to onboard its Real-World Assets (RWA) in a simple and efficient way on supported chains. Founded in 2017, Centrifuge is a decentralized asset financing protocol. The platform enables a radically faster, more cost-effective, and fully-transparent model for connecting investors and borrowers with bankless liquidity. Centrifuge is unlocking economic opportunity for all with more equitable access to capital and credit.

2022.6.29,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/29/cardano-ecosystem-builder-adaswap-launches-public-testnet/,"As you may recall back in March, we reported about AdaSwap whenthe Cardano DeFi ecosystem builderlaunched the exclusive NFT marketplace to help artists, buyers, and $ASW token holders get more value from their NFTs.Since then, the AdaSwap team has been busy working behind the scene on their next project. Today, Adaswap announced the official launch of its public testnet, making AdaSwap one of the first to launch on the Milkomeda Network to tap into Ethereum Virtual Machine capabilities. AdaSwap’s team has been building the first decentralized exchange for the Cardano ecosystem over the past few months. The project’s testnet launch marks a crucial milestone for AdaSwap and the broader Cardano ecosystem. Backed by Gal Gadot and Shima Capital,Adaswap’s main goal isto develop tools for creators and users,as well as bring high-yield staking pools and NFT contentthrough our launchpads and marketplaces. Moreover, AdaSwap is one of the first movers to explore the Milkomedia Network. With the help of this layer-2 protocol, builders can deliver Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) capabilities to blockchains that are not EVM-compatible. It extends the functionality of the Cardano ecosystem and allows for building more prominent and complex products and services. Exploring Milkomeda makes sense for Adawap, as the Layer-2 solution represents over $36 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) today. Developers have shown a keen interest in Cardano’s first functional sidechain and bringing more functionality to their communities. AdaSwap CEO Itai Levi comments: “Deploying on Milkomeda has allowed Adaswap to deploy at a rapid pace and bring lightning-fast usability to our DEX for Cardano native assets. We can’t wait for our community to explore these new opportunities and bring a new wave of liquidity to the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. We’re also looking forward to the blockchain interoperability benefits that Milkomeda will offer.” Cardano is the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, yet its DeFi and DEX ecosystem are still in the early development stage. The launch of AdaSwap will change that narrative for the better and illustrate the potential of Cardano and Milkomeda in these industry verticals. AdaSwap is the up-and-coming high-throughput decentralized exchange (DEX) tailor-made for the Cardano ecosystem and native tokens issued on this network. The project holds a significant first-mover advantage to create a micro-ecosystem to help more people build on and use the Cardano blockchain. Founded in 2019,AdaSwap is an ecosystem builder aiming to create the first decentralized exchange on the Cardano network.

Now, Pinterest co-founder and CEO Ben Silbermann just joined the list of executives leaving big tech companies. Social media platform Pinterest announced yesterday that its long-time Chief Executive Officer Ben Silbermann would step down. Silbermann will transition to the newly created role of Executive Chairman.Pinterest said that Google commerce executive Bill Readywill become Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective today, June 29, 2022. The news of the leadership change sent the Pinterest stock 9% higher in extended trading on Tuesday. Pinterest has lost about 50% of its market cap year to date. As we reported early this month,Sheryl Sandberg also stepped down from her role as Chief Operating Officer (COO) at Meta Platforms after over a decade of working at the social network giant.Sandberg became Facebook COO in 2008, becoming the company’s second-highest-ranking official and No. 2 to co-founder Facebook Zuckerberg. With over 400 million monthly active users, Pinterest has built a healthy advertising business that generated strong cash flow and doubled revenue during the pandemic. In addition, Pinterest has been laser-focused on putting Pinners first, continuously improving its roadmap, investing in creators, shopping, and scaling internationally. “Building Pinterest with such a wildly talented, kind, and creative team has been the gift of a lifetime,” said Silbermann. “Today, Pinterest inspires hundreds of millions of people with ideas for every aspect of their lives. We’ve built a growing global business that puts the well-being of our users at the core of everything we do. And we’re just getting started.” Silbermann continued, “In our next chapter, we are focused on helping Pinners buy, try and act on all the great ideas they see. Bill is a great leader for this transition. He is a builder who deeply understands commerce and payments. And he shares our passion for creating a positive corner of the Internet.

2022.6.30,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/30/dappradar-unveils-industry-first-cross-chain-token-staking-let-users-claim-staking-rewards-blockchain-minimum-fees/,"DappRadar, a global app store for decentralized applications, recently released itsJanuary blockchain games report reviewing on-chain metrics and macro events, signaling a positive outlook for games in the space. Now, DappRadar is out with major news that shows what the startup has been working on behind the scene over the past four months. Today, theKaunas, Lithuania-basedDappRadar unveiled the industry-first cross-chain token staking mechanism, allowing users to claim their staking rewards on any blockchainno matter where their RADAR is staked. That’s not all, the new cross-chain token drastically minimizes the fees related to staking. DappRadar’s cross-chain token staking is an open-source innovation that aims to contribute to the whole ecosystem. The idea behind this mechanism is to remove barriers for cost-conscious users to participate in staking by eliminating high fees, thus democratizing financial inclusion. In addition, users will earn the same APR for their staked assets across all blockchains, thereby eliminating the need to bridge assets themselves or pay the typical high Ethereum gas fees. DappRadar also stated that it’s currently not running on Ethereum, Fantom, Polygon or any other chain. However, it does track and cover all kinds of dapps, including DeFi, NFTs, games, and other verticals.  DappRadar tracks and analyzes all kinds of decentralized applications, and therefore, is a big believer in the idea that the future of the blockchain industry will be multichain, cross-chain, and interoperable. To ensure the DappRadar community has the most comprehensive choice possible, cross-chain staking will be enabled for every blockchain RADAR launches on, meaning it won’t be limited to only EVM-compatible chains. The mechanism will also ensure a smooth user experience on all chains. Explaining the newcross-chain staking, CEO and co-founder Skirmantas Januskas said, “What we have built is in the benefit of the users, especially the margin-sensitive users in emerging economies. It also improves the cross-chain user experience massively. The best part is, what we innovated is here and anyone can take it and use it. We care deeply about contribution to the blockchain industry and we believe that we can reach much higher when we build together.” DappRadar’s cross-chain token staking was developed in collaboration with the LayerZero protocol, which enables smart contracts to communicate across different chains. “Interoperability protocol LayerZero has been chosen to do the heavy lifting and allow smart contracts to communicate between different blockchains. Significantly this is not limited to EVM-compatible chains to give the DappRadar community the most comprehensive choice,” DappRadar said in a blog post. DappRadar’s Native Token: RADAR When DappRadar first launched its RADAR token in December 2021, they knew back then it was a must to make it work cross-chain. RADAR is a utility token that was first launched on the Ethereum blockchain and listed on major crypto exchanges such as Crypto.com and Huobi Global. DappRadar’s “Contribute2Earn” approach allows community members to earn RADAR by contributing to the DappRadar ecosystem. 5.000 RADAR holders gain access to DappRadar PRO features, which provide access to exclusive analytics, features, content, and reports. By holding even 1 RADAR, a community member can participate in governance to shape the future of DappRadar. RADAR Cross-Chain Token Staking will be available on any chain RADAR launches on, allowing users to stake their RADAR tokens on one chain and claim their rewards on any other chain, no matter where they were staked. To learn more about the DappRadar token, you can visit the blog post and the guide to learn more about RADAR Cross-Chain Token Staking. Founded in 2018 by CEO Skirmantas Januskas andDragos Dunica,DappRadar platform enables users to track, analyze, and discover decentralized applications. With more than 9,000 dapps, 30+ protocols and an audience of over 1 million monthly users worldwide, DappRadar is already the go-to dapp exploration platform.DappRadar nowtracks over 3,000 dapps on more than 45 blockchains, including Ethereum, EOS, ONT, and TRON, with plans to expand to others."

2022.6.30,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/06/30/blockchain-startup-klever-launches-its-own-klever-blockchain-mainnet/,"Blockchain network Klever takes the next major step in its ecosystem evolution by launching the native layer 1 blockchain, the KleverChain. As a result, the Klever ecosystem will gain its full independence to bring more products and services to its native network. Klever has positioned itself as a top-tier public blockchain infrastructure provider for the internet. The mission is to make crypto simple and ensure everyone can become part of the digital revolution. After a strong launch on the Tron network, the team now ushers in the next era of the Klever ecosystem. That new era revolves around KleverChain, the native blockchain for Klever. Blockchain technology can be difficult for newcomers, but KleverChain wants to make it simple and easy. Its ecosystem serves as a trusted and permissionless blockchain network to help grow and expand the emerging decentralized economy.  Under the hood, KleverChain uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism – more environmentally friendly than Proof-of-Work – and processes up to 3,000 transactions per second. That transaction limit will increase over time due to KleverChain’s scalability and agile structure.  KleverChain will offer pre-built and ready-to-use apps and functionalities native to the blockchain, not merely a smart contracts platform. In a smart contract blockchain platform, developers need to code a smart contract for all their blockchain applications and features, including something as simple as creating a token. This means that as a builder of dapps without smart contract experience, you have to rely on and trust the person or team that has developed the smart contract itself and simply hope that there is nothing vulnerable or malicious hidden in the smart contract. In a statement,Klever Co-Founder and CEO Dio Ianakiara said,“Klever has a completely different approach and instead builds the Klever Blockchain with smart contracts coded into the blockchain itself. It is inspired by what Satoshi Nakamoto did with Bitcoin: code once and the Klever contract or Kapp as we call it will be there forever for anyone to use.” The approach of coding open and public smart contracts directly into the blockchain layer is a groundbreaking approach and enables builders to develop decentralized applications (dapps) like never before. Moreover, KleverChain is an integral cog in the Klever Finance ecosystem, which has seen the development of easy-to-use and secure products for millions around the world.  “I don’t think developers need to understand how a blockchain works – they just have to call a well-documented function in order to use the blockchain,” Ianakiara said. Application development on KleverChain does not require smart contracts, as builders can access prebuilt and ready-to-use apps and functionalities native to the blockchain, making it simpler, faster, and cheaper to deploy dapps. Combined with the KleverOS SDK, the network will cater to the needs of mobile and web developers, regardless of their experience with blockchain and crypto. To date, Klever’s blockchain ecosystem notes over 3 million users who enjoy crypto-to-crypto trading across borders and through seamless transactional processing. Moreover, Klever is active across over 190 countries and supports several dozen languages for optimal localization support.  Rolling out the KleverChain marks a crucial milestone for Klever. The ecosystem aims to support dozens of other top blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Tron, Litecoin, Dash, Syscoin, Internet Computer, and many more.  By lowering the barrier to entry and making it easier to deploy the features you want, Klever invites a much broader community of developers, visionaries, businesses, and users worldwide.  In addition to working with independent developers and traditional industries alike to understand their needs, Klever Finance will develop and deploy the Kapps needed for legacy companies to make use of blockchain technology.  In parallel, Klever will continue to expand KleverChain’s functionalities and features, as they grow the use cases of KleverChain applications. Klever will do this with the backing of Klever’s multidisciplinary blockchain engineers with many years of experience.  “The KleverChain Mainnet launch is certainly the next chapter of the Klever Ecosystem. But more importantly, Klever Blockchain’s use of smart contracts coded native to the blockchain (Kapps) made available for developers worldwide as simple and essential crypto features to tap into at the click of a button, is in actuality taking blockchain building in the entire crypto space to the next level.” – Misha Lederman, Director of Communications of Klever.  The full Klever Blockchain Whitepaper can be viewed here.  You can also explore the decentralized mobile Klever Wallet, which supports over 20 blockchains, and the Klever Exchange, which is available on iOS, Android, and web. Those who are interested in NFTs can check out the Klever Marketplace. Additionally, there is the multi-signature solution dubbed Klever Kustody, and a Klever Hardware Wallet is in development and set to ship to customers this year.

Since then, bitcoin has struggled to move past the $22,000 mark. Fast forward nearly two weeks later, bitcoin price falls yet again below the $20,000. Bitcoin is now trading at $19,121 as of the time of writing, according to data from CryptoMarketCap. Analysts attributed the fall toa number of factors from macroeconomic worries to fear of insolvency of some crypto lending companies. Additionally, fear of inflation and recession and further rate hikes from central banks continue to weigh on the market.  As we also reported yesterday,crypto hedge fundThree Arrows Capital shocked the crypto industrywhen it announced it was unable to meet margin call demands from lenders, causing the leading crypto hedge fund into a crisis that comes as turmoil and credit crunch grip the crypto market.Three Arrows is one of the biggest and most active players in the crypto industry with investments spanning the lending and trading platforms. Then yesterday,Three Arrows Capital was ordered into liquidation by a court in the British Virgin Islands.Bloomberg also reported that the firm is now planning to sell its asset including holdings in crypto startups. The current bitcoin crash has wiped off billions of dollars of value from the cryptocurrency market as crypto investors lost their savings. However, the crash is not stoppingMichael Saylor’s MicroStrategy. Yesterday, the company doubled down its bet with another $10 million bitcoin purchase. Meanwhile,a top crypto quant fund manager thinks bitcoin may fall even further and it could be heading down to $10,000.Leigh Drogen, general partner and CIO at Texas-based digital assets quantitative hedge fund Starkiller Capital, wrote: “We’re now in the liquidation phase, [with] firms blowing up,” like Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, the crypto hedge fund that is having positions liquidated, per a report from The Block, “and on chain liquidations of over levered players.” He adds that if Bitcoin slips below $20,000, “there is going to be some serious forced selling from those really big players,” he suggests, and “that may kind of bring about the eventuality of the bottom.” 4 pm EST update: Bitcoin has now fallen below $19,000. Bitcoin is not alone. Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency also fell by more than 8% according to data from CoinMarketCap."

The ongoing inflation, coupled with fear of recession, has caused tech executives to impose a hiring freeze and other cost-cut measures astech companies announced a slew of job cuts. Some executives attributed the ongoing layoffs to a possible recession, and the need to manage the company’s burn rate and increase efficiency. According to Reuters, Facebook’s Meta has stopped the plans to hire engineers by at least 30% this year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday.Zuckerberg said that Meta has reduced its target for hiring engineers in 2022 to around 6,000-7,000, down from an initial plan to hire about 10,000 new engineers. Zuckerberg also warned Meta’s employees to brace for a deep economic downturn. “If I had to bet, I’d say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” Zuckerberg told workers in a weekly employee Q&A session, audio of which was heard by Reuters. He also added, “Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” adding that “part of my hope by raising expectations and having more aggressive goals, and just kind of turning up the heat a little bit, is thatI think some of you might decide that this place isn’t for you, and that self-selection is OK with me.” Tesla and Meta are just two of the many tech companies that have laid off their employees in recent months. As of June 27, at least 22,000 workers in the U.S. tech sector have been laid off in mass job cuts, according to layoff tracking data fromCrunchBase. More tech companies are also planning to trim their workforces to counter market challenges amid the global economic downturn."
2022.7.1,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/01/google-pay-90-million-settle-antitrust-lawsuit-app-developers-google-play/,"Alphabet Inc.’s Google has agreed to pay $90 million to settle aclass-action lawsuit with app developers overalleged anti-competitive behavior regarding Google’s App Store policies and also for enticing users to make in-app purchases, a court filingshows. The ruling is a major win for US app developers over the money they earned creating apps for Android smartphones in the Google Play store. According to a statement from Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, who represented the plaintiffs, about 48,000 US app developers who earned two million dollars or less in annual revenue through Google Play between 2016 and 2021 will be eligible for a share in the $90 million fund,with a minimum payout of $250. “Under the settlement agreement we’ve built, some class members will likely see payments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, upwards of $200,000 or more,” Berman said. In afilingat the federal court in San Francisco, the lawsuit states that “Google improperly attained and maintained a monopoly in the U.S. market for Android OS distribution services and in-app product transaction services, and used its power to prevent competition that would benefit all Android app developers.” In a blog post, Google also said that, “As part of the settlement, we’re establishing a $90 million fund to support U.S. developers who earned two million dollars or less in annual revenue through Google Play during each year from 2016-2021. A vast majority of U.S. developers who earned revenue through Google Play will be eligible to receive money from this fund, if they choose. If the Court approves the settlement, developers that qualify will be notified and allowed to receive a distribution from the fund.” “Today, nearly 48,000 hardworking app developers are receiving the just payment they deserve for their work product – something Google sought to profit from, hand over fist,” said Steve Berman, managing partner and co-founder of Hagens Berman and attorney representing the Android developers in the settlement. “Following our win against Apple for similar conduct, we think this pair of settlements sends a strong message to Big Tech: the law is watching, and even the most powerful companies in the world are accountable when they stifle competition.” Berman is not a stranger to the tech community and the power of the big tech. In his 41-year legal career, Berman has achieved monumental victories against Big Tech. He also served as co-lead interim class counsel in the lawsuit against Google. He previously championed a $560 million collective settlement against Apple and book publishers regarding e-book price-fixing, a $100 million settlement against Apple on behalf of iOS app developers, and his firm has pending litigation against Facebook, Amazon and many more Big Tech kingpins for issues related to antitrust and consumer rights."

Up until June 21, Musk’s tweets were making headlines near-daily as he shared updates on the deal. But afterten days of absence from the popular social platform, Elon Musk is now on his longest stretch without posting in nearly five years. His absence has also led to speculations that Musk’s been busy working on his $44 million deal and that his next tweet is going to be a major announcement that he now owns Twitter.The Wall Street Journal also reported yesterday that “the billionaire is trying to complete a planned $44 billion deal to buy the social-media platform.” Musk’s absence has also caused some of his 100 million fans to start asking about him.

2022.7.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.7.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."

His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate. Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2022  Another analysis conducted by Israeli cybersecurity company CHEQ back in May found that12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.“Up to 12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.”CHEQ found that11.71% of all website visits originating from Twitter were by bots or fake users. On April 25, Twitter agreed to sell the company to Elon Musk for $44 billion.Under the terms of the agreement, Twitter stockholders will receive$54.20in cash for each share of Twitter common stock that they own upon closing the proposed transaction. The purchase price represents a 38% premium to Twitter’s closing stock price onApril 1, 2022, which was the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in Twitter.Musk needed to use his Tesla stock to raise $21 billion in equity to fund his takeover of the social media giant.

In just a decade, what started as a hobby for many drone enthusiasts has turned into a multi-billion dollar industry. Due to the growing demand for drones from organizations and the government, thetotal drone market size is estimated to be worth $100 billion. Unlike old drones that used remote controllers,technological advances such as artificial intelligence now make it easy to manipulate and maneuver modern-day drones. Anyone withsmartphones can now fly mini-drones with just little to a few hours of training. The use of drones can be found in every industry, especially in transportation and logistics. Today, drones are being used to deliver medical supplies and other life-saving medicines toemergency responders,doctors, and patients in remote parts of the world. One startup that’s leading the future of the drone revolution is a Half Moon Bay, California-based drone startup calledZipline. This logistics startup is currently working with NGOs and pharmaceutical companies to vaccines to people in remote villages in Africa. We first wrote aboutZiplineback in 2019 after the startupdemonstrated its medical supply drones for the US military.Zipline first made a name for itself in Rwanda and Ghana, where the startup delivered blood, vaccines, life-saving medications, andother emergency medical supplies in remote villages using its autonomous electric drones.Today, Zipline has grown exponentially and expanded its autonomous aircraft delivery service to many other countries in Africa and around the world. In August 2019, Zipline light unmanned aircraft made hundreds of supply drops during the Australian live-fire wargames.The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Naval Medical Research Center’s Naval Advanced Medical Development(NMRC-NAMD) also usedZipline’sautonomous drones to make more than 380 deliveries of blood and other medical supplies to troops amid a live-fire exercise with U.S., Australian, and other forces. “The U.S. military is one of the largest providers of life-saving health care and critical aid in conflict, humanitarian and disaster relief scenarios around the world. Zipline is proud to partner with the Defense Department because our goal is to get people the care they need to stay healthy and alive no matter where they are in the world and no matter the circumstances,” says Zipline CEO Keller Rinaudo. Just last November,Zipline partnered with Pfizer and BioNTechfor the first mRNA covid-19 vaccines in Ghana. The startup completed the first long-range drone delivery of both authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines requiring ultra-cold-chain in Ghana. The collaboration allows for the distribution of approximately 50,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Ghana, pioneering a new model for vaccine distribution. To date, Zipline has distributed more than 220,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from multiple manufacturers, the first company to do so through an autonomous aircraft on the national scale. Zipline said it plans to distribute millions more as supply becomes available. Just last month, Zipline announced it has achieved Part 135 air carrier certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). “Being certified as a U.S. airline is a powerful step forward toward scaling safe, sustainable drone delivery operations in the U.S. and around the world,” the company said in a statement. Four months earlier,Zipline also announced in a Twitter post that it had partnered with the Government of Ghana andGavi Vaccine Allianceto enable rapid, equitable, and cost-effective delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Zipline is proud to partner with the Government of Ghana and @gavi to enable rapid, equitable, and cost-effective #lastmiledelivery of COVID-19 vaccines. #covax #instantdelivery #dronesforgoodhttps://t.co/nHR0ceBKPB — Zipline (@zipline) January 20, 2022   Founded in 2014 byKeenan Wyrobek, Keller Rinaudo, and Will Hetzler, the Half Moon Bay, California-basedZipline designs, manufactures, and operates drones to deliver vital medical products to everyone, no matter where they live. To date, Zipline has flown 18,083,320miles, made 254,233commercial deliveries,delivered1,891,400 bottles of medicine, and served over 25 millioncustomers. Zipline has built the world’s fastest and most reliable delivery drone, the world’s largest autonomous logistics network. Since its inception eight years ago, Zipline has raised a total of $483 million in funding over 8 rounds. In June 2021, Zipline,raised $250 in a Series E round at a $2.75B valuation toexpand its logistics networks in Africa and the United States.

2022.7.4,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/04/regulatory-friction-hampering-european-startups-growth-research-suggests/,"As economic uncertainty continues to impact global tech markets, an abundance of regulatory ‘friction’ poses a serious threat to European startup growth, according to new research published today from Stripe, a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. 1 in 3 startups have considered launching their business elsewhere due to the scale of the compliance burden. The research – ‘European Tech Voices: perspectives from Europe’s fastest-growing startups’ – is a quantitative and qualitative study conducted by B2B International among nearly 200 Stripe users, including Kry, Alma, and Ticketswap. The report examines the European startup experience from the perspective of fast-growing internet businesses, and their views on how policy and regulation are acting as an enabler and barriers to growth. “As tech builders across Europe face an increasingly difficult economic environment, it is more important than ever to listen to the voices and needs of the startup community. We wanted to hear directly from businesses using Stripe, as the future generation of European tech leaders, to better understand the realities they’re facing and identify the main obstacles to growth,” said Matt Henderson, international business lead at Stripe. Strong foundations in European tech, increasingly under strain European startups recognize the advantages Europe has compared to other global tech markets: But despite these strong foundations, the ‘friction’ caused by complex regulatory procedures and outdated compliance practices are adding pressure on limited stretched resources. Over half (53%) of respondents say time spent adhering to compliance processes is the greatest threat regulation poses to their businesses. Over three quarters (79%) say the time spent on compliance has increased. The growing disconnect between startups and policymakers Part of the issue is an emerging mismatch between policymaker and startup communities. 83% of respondents say policymaking is geared towards established companies, and only 12% believe that policymakers understand the realities they are facing. Rather than hallmark pieces of regulation, the research shows startups want policymakers to focus on policies geared towards reducing friction and saving increasingly valuable resources. For example, out of the practices set out in the EU’s Startup Nation Standard, the commitment to ‘digital first’ was cited as the top priority for smooth startup creation and growth. The Baltic states were called out by the greatest number of respondents (36%) for having the most innovative approach to policy, with efforts among Baltic countries to digitize government processes seen to be driving this perception. Delivering on startup priorities Based on learnings and insights from this research, Stripe has outlined five areas policymakers should look to prioritize, in order to ensure startups can survive and thrive going forward: Henderson adds: “European startups have proven resilient during disruptive periods before, but that shouldn’t lure us into a false sense of security. When it comes to policymaker priorities, the focus has to now turn to reduce regulatory friction for Europe’s internet businesses, to help them turbocharge growth when market conditions improve.” The full report, “European Tech Voices”, can be downloaded here. Methodology The research consisted of one-hour in-depth interviews carried out in January and February 2022 by B2B International with 10 Stripe users, including Kry, Alma, TicketSwap, Klub, Doctolib, Café, Sunday, and Wollit – representing startups and scaleups across different industries to understand their perspectives and attitudes in detail. This informed the development of a quantitative questionnaire used to validate and measure the key findings. The survey was conducted online between March and April 2022 and was completed by 172 Stripe users from the UK, France, Spain, Ireland, DACH, Italy, the Baltics, Benelux, Scandinavia, Greece, and Eastern Europe. About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies, from the world’s largest groups to the most ambitious startups, use Stripe to accept payments, increase revenue and generate new business opportunities. In Europe, one in two new unicorns is built on Stripe. With dual headquarters in San Francisco and Dublin, the company aims to grow internet GDP.

Multichain supports over 53 blockchains, 2400+ bridges, and thousands of assets, including ETH, USDC, BUSD, BNB, WBTC, and DAI. Today, Multichain announced it has integrated with the RSK blockchain to facilitate the transfer of ETH, USDC, BUSD, and other assets between RSK, Ethereum, and BNB Chain. It marks a significant achievement for Multichain by integrating the first Bitcoin sidechain to enable greater access to DeFi on Bitcoin. To date, Multichain processes hundreds of millions of dollars in daily volume thanks to its growing community spanning thousands of daily users. Moreover, Multichain represents over $3 billion in Total Value Locked, making it one of the top players in the cross-chain field. Adding support for Rootstock signifies a new chapter for Multichain. RSK is the first sidechain on Bitcoin to be integrated. It holds a unique position between Bitcoin enthusiasts and EVM-powered DeFi on the most secure smart contract platform in the world. Multichain’s integration of Rootstock provides core benefits to builders leveraging RSK. For instance, they do not need to spend resources on building bridges to access capital and addressable markets. Additionally, they have a shorter time to market for new platforms built on RSK. Lastly, the ongoing updates and optimizations of the Multichain bridge will benefit RSK builders. Multichain recently introduced a new version of its anyCall interoperability protocol enabling cross-chain messages and name contracts. It will be a powerful tool for the development of cross-chain decentralized applications on Rootstock and other supported networks. Users can start bridging their ETH, USDC, BUSD, BNB, WBTC, and DAI between RSK, Ethereum, and, coming soon, BNB Chain. Multichain will make further chains and tokens available for RSK network bridging over the coming weeks and months. RSK Co-Founder Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar said on the integration, “I’m excited to see Multichain choose to integrate RSK as its first Bitcoin layer 2. RSK is home to the fastest-growing DeFi for Bitcoin ecosystem with protocols that are built to last and provide real solutions to the issues users face in centralized finance. This is a huge step forward in interoperability for RSK that means thousands of new users can access these DeFi services.” Born on July 20th, 2020 as Anyswap,Multichain addresses the clear need for distinct and diverse blockchains to communicate with one another. Multichain promotes interoperability across different networks and actualizes smooth asset and value transfers through its cross-chain architecture. Multichain is leading the cross-chain sector with over 53 (and growing) non-EVM and EVM chains integrated. RSK is the world’s most secure smart contract network. By utilizing merged mining to leverage the security of the Bitcoin Network, and enabling EVM-compatible smart contracts, RSK is facilitating the growth of a new decentralized global economy."
2022.7.5,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/05/coal-back-dead-europes-coal-import-first-half-rose-35-year-earlier/,"For many years, the European Union (EU) has been calling on other nations to reduce their carbon emissions. Now, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has exposedEU energy vulnerability and its reliance on Russian energy as Moscow tightens the supply of natural gas to some of the countries in the bloc. According to Bloomberg, Europe’s coal imports in the first half rose 35% from a year earlier aslow inventories and concerns over energy security caused the EU to turn to the dirty fossil fuels it once despised. CitingKpler, Bloomberg reported that the amount of coal imported into the Antwerp-Rotterdam-Amsterdam (ARA) region, a huge transport hub for energy and commodities, in the first half of this year, surged 35% to 26.9 million tons compared with the same period last year. As Europe scrambles to deal with the fallout from sanctions imposed on Russia,Matthew Boyle, lead analyst for dry bulks, gas and LNG at Kpler Insight, told Bloomberg that coal shipments are soaring in the ARA region. For example, coal inventories have doubled to almost 6.6 million tons from more than a five-year low in the first quarter. Most of the coal shipments coalfrom the US, Colombia, and Australia, This means the coal has to be shipped over a long distance, further adding to the carbon emissions.As Reuters noted back in April, shipping gas over a long distance leads to more carbon emissions from liquefaction, shipping, and regasification. The situation with coal is even worse. Meanwhile, the ARA region is not alone. Last month, we wrote about Germany when it went back to burning coal after spending close to a trillion on renewable energy.According to multiple reports,Germany is now “planning to fire up coal plants as Russia throttles gas supplies.” For decades, the European Union (EU) has been aggressively pursuing a clean energy future as it plans to end its reliance on fossil fuels, but the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has highlighted the shortalls of renewables. For example,theEU currently gets about 40% of all its energy from Russia, including 41.1% of its gas supply even with billions of dollars of investment spent on renewable energy. In April, theEU announced that it expects toremain dependent on energy imports from Russia for at least another five years, according to a report from the TASS news agency. The Commission added thatits reliance on Russian gas won’t end until at least 2027. Now, the EU is facing soaring gas prices as Russia threatened to cut off the gas supplies if payments are not made in Ruble. In addition, transitioning to renewable energy sources also takes time. For now, the EU has to rely on dirty fossil fuels to solve its energy crisis. In the meantime, Germany is preparing for gas rationing while France’s power grid operator is asking consumers to use less electricity. The situation in the UK isn’t any better as protests broke out over the latest electricity price hike that plunged millions of Briton households into what some called fuel to stress. Currently, wind and hydro constitute two-thirds of the total renewable energy output in Europe.Considering that renewable energy sources accounted for 37.5 percent of gross electricity consumption in 2022, many are asking: Whywould Germany have to brace for gas rationing and France ask its citizens to consume less electricity?"

If true, cyber experts say it would be one of the biggest data breaches in history. It all started last week afterChinaDan posted on the hacker forum Breach Forums and offered to sell more than 23 terabytes (TB) of data for 10 bitcoin, equivalent to about $200,000, Reuters reported. In a post,ChinaDan wrote:“In 2022, the Shanghai National Police (SHGA) database was leaked. This database contains many TB of data and information on Billions of Chinese citizen.” He went on to say that the “Databases contain information on 1 Billion Chinese national residents and several billion case records, including name, address, birthplace, national ID number, mobile number, all crime/case details.” The authenticity of the post, which was widely discussed on China’s Weibo and WeChat social media platforms over the weekend, has not beenverified.

That’s a staggering number to comprehend. Unfortunately, traditional video games are, for the most part, limited to the Web2 platforms and have not yet made their way to blockchain. However, the popularity of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has led to the sudden explosion of blockchain games as more and more players look to cash in from play-to-earn games.According to someestimates, there are currently 398 ‘active’ blockchain games, more than doubled the number a year before. But that’s about to change, thanks toJason Fung, the former head of short video giant TikTok’s gaming unit. Today, Jason announced the launch of ablockchain games startup together with his co-founder to enable players to trade NFT items even as tech heavyweights remain wary of the sector. Fung’s new startup is called Meta0. In an interview, The 34-year-old Fung told Reuters that he left TikTok last month after two years with the firm after seeing an opportunity to “offer a solution to the current segregated nature of infrastructure options available to developers looking to build blockchain games.” In a statement,Fung told Reuters in Hong Kong, “Right now, if you look at any developer when they implement NFTs or blockchain in their games, they have to choose a single blockchain, be it Polygon or Solana or Binance Smart Chain. But imagine a more interoperable option,” referring to popular existing blockchains. “So we decided, let’s do it. Let’s co-found this company. Let’s give up my cushy corporate life at TikTok and take a giant risk,” said Fung, who was based in Shenzhen and had reported to TikTok’s chief operating officer Vanessa Pappas. Meta0’sfounding team includes six members in addition to the two co-founders. Fung told Reuters that the startup already closed its first round of funding. The total amount was not disclosed. Neither did Fung disclose the details ofthe other co-founder and the rest of the team. Fung added that the Meta0 was still looking to raise funds through issuing tokens, as well as from venture capitalists and strategic investors. According to investment banking firm Drake Star Partners in April,the blockchain gaming industry had raised a record $1.2 billion in the first quarter before the ongoing crypto market turmoil. In 2021, investors poured a total of $3.6 billion into the blockchain games sector. Talking about the future prospects of blockchain gaming, Fung said:“We’ve built a protocol for game developers, and we take a flexible, blockchain-agnostic approach to their game development.” He also added: “With a protocol that we’re developing, developers can easily build their game-leveraging strengths of different blockchains, and allow the user the flexibility of transferring their NFTs cross-chain.”"
2022.7.5,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/05/theblock-research-showcases-strong-fundamentals-for-bitcoin-dapps/,"Builders flock to networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain to build DeFi-oriented applications. However, the ecosystems developing on top of Bitcoin create a compelling alternative. Now. more than ever, it seems as though the future of DeFi should be built on the Bitcoin network, as it provides crucial benefits to all participants. Bitcoin has been known as the network for the world’s leading cryptocurrency for over a decade. However, it has not been the most appealing option for builders looking to develop complex products and services. Unlike the Ethereums and BNB Chains of the world, Bitcoin did not support smart contract functionality. Nor did it have proper scaling solutions, let alone EVM compatibility. All of that changed thanks to new ecosystems building on top of Bitcoin. For example, the Lightning Network provides tremendous scaling opportunities to route [micro]payments globally at nearly no cost and without lengthy delays. In addition, the Rootstock (RSK) ecosystem provides EVM compatibility, enabling a cross-chain future. Furthermore, Stacks provides the smart contract layer to build DeFi, NFTs, and other concepts on the Bitcoin network.  Thanks to all of these building blocks, the future of Bitcoin looks very different. It remains the most secure blockchain in the world, with growing support from miners securing transactions. Additionally, it is the most-recognized “brand” in all of the cryptocurrencies and the network with true immutability – unlike Ethereum – and no validators – unlike BNB Chain. In addition, it has the biggest untapped potential in decentralized finance today. More specifically, there are ways to “wrap” Bitcoin on other blockchains and engage in DeFi, dApps, etc. Wrapping and unwrapping tokens is a costly and unnecessary endeavor once builders start developing apps on Bitcoin or the three ecosystems mentioned earlier. Those extra protocols and Dapps will bring more miner fees to those who secure the network, ensuring Bitcoin mining remains sustainable regardless of the BTC price. Solutions like Rootstock, Stacks, and the Lightning Network bring tremendous functionality to Bitcoin. Recent research by TheBlock showcases how quickly these ecosystems are growing as of late. More importantly, one would expect the smart contract layer to cause network bloat because it processes a significant amount of data. However, Stacks preserves Bitcoin’s bandwidth and writes into the Bitcoin blockchain through a Proof-of-Transfer protocol without causing network congestion. Additionally, Stacks has attracted over $200 million in TVL, confirming strong interest in building smart contracts on Bitcoin.  Furthermore, Blockstream and Stacks have joined forces with other industry participants to incentivize Dapp building on Bitcoin. A $165 million Bitcoin odyssey fund has been created, paving the way for future products and services. Additionally, Blockchain raised $299 million to keep building, whereas the Stacks ecosystem has secured $220 million. All of that money will be used to unlock the future of decentralized applications on Bitcoin. Further expansion will come from external developers and teams. Block will build a decentralized exchange on Bitcoin, and Jack Dorsey has plans for what he dubbed “web5”, which will run on the Bitcoin network. Additionally, dozens of startups are exploring new opportunities, including Superfando, Arkadiko, Gamma, Sovryn, etc. With these three big ecosystems focusing on extending Bitcoin’s functionality in their own way, there is no reason not to build on Bitcoin. The biggest and most secure blockchain has smart contracts through Stacks, EVM compatibility with Rootstock, and scales through the Lightning Network. Expanding Bitcoin’s Dapp ecosystem will benefit the network, the users, and the miners who can tap into additional earnings. It is a no-brainer for anyone who is serious about decentralization and empowering users."
2022.7.5,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/05/cmo-spotlight-daniel-zweig-future-email-marketing/,"It’s been a while since we’ve had theStartup Spotlight series where we get into the minds of startup founders, CEOs, and business owners and their stories. The idea behind the series is to give you insights into the mind of great leaders and how they grow their companies so you can learn from their success and ultimatelybecome successful entrepreneurs. Additionally, we also interview these business leaders to learn about the brief history of their companies, their mission, their products and services, value proposition, and lessons they learned along the way. Today, we’re excited to have Daniel Zweig,Daniel Zweig, Head of Marketing at WiseStamp,a technology startup company that provides a platform for companies to create email signatures. Thank youDaniel for doing this interview.  Question: You’ve been working in the marketing field since 2011 and worked for major companies like Wix and, now, WiseStamp. Can you introduce yourself and briefly mention a few of your career highlights? Answer: I’m Daniel, I’ve been managing WiseStamp marketing department for two years now, and before I was responsible for the acquisition and emails departments, but I’ve been in the online marketing industry for over 12 years. I started my journey at K Logic, one of Israel’s leading marketing agencies, and got the opportunity to work with some of the biggest names in tech; Microsoft and the Israeli telecom company Bezeq. I’ve got the opportunity to work on some really big and exciting campaigns, including the Windows 10 launch in Israel. During my four years with WiseStamp, I’ve watched the company go from strength to strength as we turned WiseStamp into the leading email signature manager for companies all over the world. From the Head of Acquisition to VP Marketing, I’ve tried to do my best to help WiseStamp grow, and I’m really proud to have been a part of it. Question: Although more people are opening emails during the pandemic, the overall conversion rate for email marketing has fallen since its peak in 2018. So is email marketing going out of fashion? Answer: Definitely not. I don’t believe email marketing is sustained by fashion. For about 20 years email marketing has been the most ROI-positive way businesses can communicate with their clients. We know over 90% of people check their emails daily, and most of us use email for our most important business communications. As long as that’s true, email marketing will only prosper. Email is not like social media or a blog, it’s not a place to meet friends, it’s not a place to be entertained, it’s a work tool. So, we are at our most open to making business decisions when we communicate over email. This unlocks significant financial benefits for businesses, with ROI’s, in some instances, as high as 4400%. More often than you’d think, customers prefer receiving information in their mailbox, as our email has also become our private archive for invoices, documents, etc. And given the right context, people love receiving promotional deals right to their email. In a nutshell, email marketing is still a big deal; I really don’t see it falling out of use anytime soon. The high conversion rate we get from this channel makes me think the contrary. The dip we see now could be a result of two things. A. The increasing competition on the consumers’ attention as more businesses understand the power of email marketing and B. The development of anti-spam processes in Gmail, Outlook, and other platforms that prevents our marketing emails from reaching their target. Because of these new anti-spam technologies, I imagine that in the future the email marketing industry will diverge into two main groups; the ‘white hat’ which will do permission-based marketing with double opt-in methods, and the ‘black hat’ who will double down on spamming techniques to get their unsolicited marketing material through spam barriers and into our inbox’s. Question: There are dozens of email marketing solutions on the market, but we hear much less about Email Signature Marketing tools. WiseStamp has grown really fast offering this solution. So what makes managing your company signatures so attractive for businesses? Answer: In a high competition market, businesses must find ways to increase their brand exposure, distinguish themselves and build trust with their audience. An email signature is a little bit like a snapshot of your company. It’s your company’s ID or business card. When someone reads an email sent by your company they would look at the email signature for company assurance, to make sure you are who you are, check your contact information, the social media links, a way to contact your sales, and just to get a general sense of who you are. Knowing this, you have to assume that your email signature frequently makes or breaks the impression you leave on your email recipients. Whether you know it or not, the simple fact that you have an email signature, already means you are doing email signature marketing. So why not take charge of it? This is where email signature marketing and branding tools like WiseStamp come in handy. An email signature manager will give you control over all your company’s email signatures. This is huge! Once you have that you can brand every email your company sends to establish brand awareness within your audience and increase trust. Beyond email signature branding, email signature marketing tools also permit you to add a button or a banner to help your various departments create relevant call-to-actions, directly in their signature. This can also be used to feature sales campaigns or other promotional initiatives. Question: Individuals and businesses have to compete to stand out from the crowd in today’s marketing economy. Can you recall a few examples where Wisestamp’s email signatures were used unexpectedly to achieve that? Answer: We’ve received an abundance of positive feedback about many of our features that help make the email signature more dynamic and eye-catching. For example, using an animated logo or banner, adding one of our animated hand signoffs, or adding a video to employees’ email signatures captures the reader’s attention. Suddenly, the employees’ signatures aren’t just professional-looking but also get more engagement and prime people for taking action. Question: How do you think the pandemic has affected marketing strategies? Can you predict any new trends emerging in the wake of COVID-19? Answer: Since the start of the pandemic, marketers have had to adapt, rethink, and manage budget cuts; and I do think some of these changes have the potential to stick. As people spend more time at home, with today’s post-pandemic hybrid work model, we’re online shopping now more than ever. Instead of going to public places, we’ll likely see a steady decline in traditional advertising budgets like billboards, and digital marketing will become more in demand. Managing the online relationships between businesses and consumers is more critical than ever before. So, I expect more businesses will pay even more attention to their web presence and digital communications with users. For instance, self-serve, increased online purchasing possibilities, and the digitalization of off-line services where possible. In addition, more and more businesses understand that automating processes that used to be done manually is essential for them to meet the communication needs of their users. Online shopping has always been big, but sales increased massively during Covid. As a result, more businesses realize the importance of improving their online presence and leveraging their analytics to do this. Another field I predict will be huge in the next few years is TV digital marketing and TV CPM campaigns abilities. But that’s another whole story we’ll have to cover in another discussion. Question: You’ve worked extensively with small businesses in the past. Now we live in a world where more and more people choose to become self-employed and start their own small businesses. What advice would you give new entrepreneurs navigating marketing strategy for the first time? Answer: Any good marketing strategy is multifaceted. There are many moving parts to focus on, so building a complete marketing strategy is a long process. I think focusing on each part at a time and understanding that digital marketing is an accumulative process will help new entrepreneurs do things gradually and build their strategies better. For example, boosting your social media content is a massive one. Start by spending $50 a month, seeing what it brings, then experimenting and trying different things. I’d also advise entrepreneurs to keep a close eye on marketing trends. For example, short video content is enormous at the moment; many businesses are using it to promote their brand. And capture every opportunity to leave a good impression! It’s vital. For that, a quality email signature will undoubtedly help, but this also means creating a solid email marketing strategy. This involves knowing how to improve audience engagement, open rates, and conversions by monitoring your campaigns and making any necessary adjustments. Question: What, in your opinion, makes a good quality email signature? Answer: An email signature is like a modern-day business card. With that in mind, I think any sound email signature should have: Question: What, in your opinion, forms a high-quality email marketing campaign? Answer:Of course that establishing sending frequency and goals for your campaign and creating a simple and eye-catching design will help you create an effective email flow. But after testing thousands of emails and campaigns, I can say with confidence that one of the most important factors in an email campaign is timing – meaning, what time during the week and during the day you send your email. This has the most meaningful impact on the open and clicks rate, sometimes even more than a better subject line or more engaging email design or content. Also, a very important tip is you must A/B TEST at every opportunity. Try try try; you never know what you’re going to find out by changing even the smallest things. Question: How important would you say email automation is to the success of email marketing campaigns? Answer: Email automation is essential if you’re hoping to run a successful marketing campaign. Today email marketing systems allow marketers to set rules and triggers to help their audience move through their marketing funnel based on their actions. Not only does it save time, but it also makes it easier to scale campaigns and accordingly increase sales. Mostly, because it facilitates more personalization, which, as I’ve already touched on, massively improves the user experience. Lastly, make sure to utilize social media – use your channels for advertising your products and targeting specific demographics. This makes it easier to reach your audience, giving you a better chance of getting them to sign up for your email list."
2022.7.5,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/05/danish-iot-startup-onomondo-raises-21m-address-current-iot-barriers-offers-interoperable-cross-border-connectivity/,"The supply chain has become a global issue in recent months as China shut down Shanghai due to its zero-covid policy. But that’s just part of the problem. When you’re moving goods across the globe, every border becomes a barrier–an invisible line that presents real challenges to international trade and global collaboration. Over the years, major technological advancements in the area of the Internet of Things (IoT) have reduced these barriers. However,despite advances in hardware and cloud, the connectivity component of the IoT remains a stubborn barrier, with today’s approaches relying on a patchwork of telecom operators and expensive solutions that cannot be tailored. This patchwork means businesses cannot gain sufficient interoperability, visibility, or cost control over their connected assets on a global basis. EnterOnomondo, a Danish tech startup that has redesigned existing connectivity architecture to create a single virtualized IoT network, without reliance on the traditional operator tech stack. Instead, the firm has integrated more than 700 operators across more than 180 countries, as well as layering its own API-based IoT platform on top to build a global IoT network and network management platform. Onomondo offers a pay-as-you-go model which is much more cost effective and can be tailored depending on what is appropriate for the use case.Its current customers include Bosch, Carlsberg, and Maersk. Today,Onomondo announced it has raised$21 million in growth funding led by Verdane, with participation from existing investors: Maersk Growth, People Ventures, and The Danish Growth Fund.Onomondo will use the funding proceeds to accelerate growth in Europe with plans to triple Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in 2022 and 2023. Founded in 2012 byHenrik Aagaard, Michael Bak, and Michael Karlsen, theCopenhagen, Denmark-based Onomondo is a global cellular operator for the Internet of Things, working to connect and simplify enterprise-grade connected services across the globe. Devices connected to Onomondo contain an interoperable SIM card, meaning assets can seamlessly move across national borders without the inherent complexity of roaming. Data is transferred directly across the Onomondo virtual network to one of the firm’s cloud partners (Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud and more), so enterprises can easily understand what is going on between devices and the network, through to the core network, and on to the IoT cloud from a single interface. As a natural extension of the architectural redesign, Onomondo also redesigned its commercial offering to be unlike any offering existing today. As the platform includes a connectivity marketplace, enterprises can set priorities based on cost, coverage and performance, empowering the platform to automatically select the best operator in any given location, at any given time. This feature prevents operator lock-in by offering the freedom to control precisely which networks devices connect to, as well as giving enterprises the flexibility to balance the quality of coverage and cost-optimization, depending on the use case. Michael Karlsen, Co-Founder & CEO, and Henrik Aagaard, Co-Founder & CTO at Onomondo commented: “It’s interesting how the attention in IoT has traditionally centered around Hardware and Cloud. Connectivity was the commodity added in the end. We see a clear shift now towards the market asking for more from their connectivity solution. This trend will dramatically heighten the success rate of IoT and lower both complexity and barriers to entry. All of this will eventually benefit both people, profit, and the planet. Onomondo and our recent momentum is a clear representation of this shift and we have found Verdane to be the perfect partner to help us deliver fully on this vision and accelerate our growth.” This latest funding round has been led by Verdane, a leading growth equity investment firm that specializes in scaling digital consumer, software, and sustainable social businesses. Coupled with participation from existing investors, Onomondo will leverage the new funds to drive growth and meet its planned projection of tripling its ARR in 2022 and 2023. The company also plans to scale its team from 50 to 100 by the end of 2022, helping to expand its customer base, which currently includes the likes of Bosch, Carlsberg, and Maersk. “Drawing from a deep understanding of traditional network infrastructure, Michael, Henrik and the Onomondo team is bringing a fresh, next-generation approach to the challenges the IoT market continues to face today,” Pål Malmros, Partner at Verdane concluded. “We are convinced that Onomondo’s solution has the potential to vastly accelerate global roll-out of IoT, as well as expand the total set of addressable use cases, and we look forward to partnering with the company to significantly accelerate the business’ expansion and growth internationally, drawing on the Verdane team’s experience from over 45 other software investments.” Verdane has a strong record investing in tech-enabled businesses, including software, having been named the most active financial investor in Nordic software growth companies 2016-2020 in 2020 by PwC, and declared a Top 4 most active GP acquirer of Nordic-based companies by deal count 2015-2021 by Pitchbook in 2021. The firm currently holds over 30 software businesses in its portfolio, including companies like Nomentia, Eduhouse, Evondos, inriver, Danelec Marine, meister, Papirfly, Parkopedia, StudyTube, and Voyado."

2022.7.6,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/06/why-you-should-build-your-dapp-on-the-defichain-blockchain-the-ultimate-guide-to-defichain/,"You’ve probably seen it in the headlines or heard about it countless times, decentralized finance (DeFi) is aan emerging financial technology that’s set to revolutionize global finance as we know it. DeFi is a collective term used forblockchain financial applications designed tocut the middleman out of financial services, such as lending, borrowing, trading, and investing but with cryptocurrency. These blockchain applications are calleddecentralized applications, or dApps. Just like traditional applications, DApp provides some function or utility to its users. DApp represents a new way of doing finance without all the red tapes of traditional finance.One of the major differences with traditional finance is that dApps are built on a decentralized network and can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts that run on a blockchain network. DApps have evolved since they were first introduced in May 2017. Back then, building a new dApp was complex, and time-consuming with so many moving parts. Today, the number of dApps has grown exponentially, thanks to new blockchain ecosystems and tools. Now, we’re entering a new era of the next generation of decentralized finance applications, with new functions, products, and services. To build these next generation of dApps, builders and developers need to leveragethe most secure and robust networks and also pay close attention to the most popular cryptocurrency–bitcoin. As such, old dApp tools will no longer cut it. DApp developers also need to build their applications on a decentralized blockchain platform that is fast, intelligent, and transparent about its centralized financial services. And that is where DeFiChain comes in, ablockchain specifically dedicated to decentralized financial applications. DeFiChain is a blockchain platform that was built to leverage the power of DeFi within the Bitcoin network. Supported by a network of nodes or computers to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions, DeFiChain aims to resolve some of the common issues relating to security, decentralization, and scalability. Launched just three years ago, DeFiChain was created to offer all the DeFI benefits including lending, borrowing, and investing. DeFiChain also offers full transparency and no single authority controls the network. For builders and developers creating new dApps, hereare reasons why you should choose DeFi Blockchain as your next platform to build your decentralized apps. With so many cryptocurrencies out there, one thing that sets bitcoin apart is its security and safe and secure environment. The team behind DeFiChain also recognizes this unique strength of bitcoin. In addition todedicating the functionality of a blockchain specifically to decentralized finance, DeFiChain provides high transaction throughput, reduced risk of errors, and intelligent feature development specifically for the fulfillment of Satoshi’s original intent: “To create a reliable alternative form of financial services built on top of Bitcoin.” Althoughmany users may see DeFiChain as a separate standalone and distinguished blockchain network, the DeFiChain team of developers built it with security and Bitcoin in mind. More specifically, by anchoring itself to the Bitcoin blockchain, DeFiChain’s immediate security and immutability are possible. As a result, the DeFiChain saves its most recent Merkle tree to the Bitcoin every few minutes. Over the years, the evolution of Ethereum and smart contracts has allowed for tremendous new functionalities to be built on top of a blockchain, however, this development and capabilities come at a cost. The DeFiChain team is well aware of this. As such, DeFiChain approaches DeFi as a specific and critical segment of the blockchain community and a dedicated blockchain that is optimized specifically for DeFi applications. The DeFiChain approach ensures the most recent DeFiChain records are fully secure and immutable and can be checked against records anchored to Bitcoin. In addition, leveraging Bitcoin’s security keeps DeFiChain safe from attacks, hackers, and vulnerabilities. DeFiChain takes the best of the two worlds: it is anchored to Bitcoin and also retains a native consensus mechanism and function set. These two are necessary, as the Bitcoin network lacks smart contract functionality and other properties. In addition, using Proof-of-Stake enables better scaling, lower energy consumption, fast transactions, and multi-token support, among other benefits outlined in the DeFiChain whitepaper. One of the challenges with most blockchain applications is their carbon footprint. Unlike bitcoin which uses Proof-of-Workwhich requires a lot of energy to validate its transactions,DeFiChain uses Proof-of-Stake which lowers the amount of energy usage. As of November 2021, DeFiChain was officially a 100% carbon-neutral blockchain. Proof-of-stake is a consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain to ensure that only valid entries are entered into a distributed database in a safe and secure fashion. As such, using Proof-of-Stake serves another crucial purpose within the DeFiChain ecosystem. As it is a more efficient network and one that enables better energy efficiency, it paves the way for DeFiChain to become carbon neutral network. In recent years, bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains, have come under intense scrutiny for their environmental impact. Pushing further into renewable energy for mining purposes will help alleviate those concerns. For DeFiChain, the push to become carbon neutral is essential. The network achieved carbon neutrality several months ago and continues to offset CO2 emissions generated by blockchain operations without skipping a beat. Moreover, DeFiChain illustrates how decentralized finance on Bitcoin can be carbon neutral, whereas other popular networks – like Ethereum – continue to affect the environment negatively. As we discussed earlier, one of the most important ingredients of any thriving community is trust and transparency. DeFiChain is a community-owned platform with full transparency and no single authority controls the network.As such, the community plays a larger role in the proper functioning of the ecosystem. A thriving blockchain ecosystem relies on its users and node operators to achieve decentralization.But the core developers will often retain a degree of control to improve the network and make adjustments. DeFiChain is entirely community-owned, making all users responsible for maintaining the network and figuring out ways to make it better and more robust. All DeFiChain community members can contribute to this process through DeFiChain Improvement Proposals (DFIPs). It is another great example of achieving decentralized governance and putting community members in the driving seat. Moreover, it creates a place for conversation and healthy discussion, which can push the DeFiChain ecosystem to new heights. As an ecosystem grows larger, the need for feedback is also paramount. One otherexciting addition to the DeFiChain ecosystem is the native Accelerator. This feature will serve as a solution to boost the adoption of DeFiChain and DeFi on Bitcoin, with the goal of becoming the default decentralized finance blockchain. The Accelerator will aid developers in jump-starting their business in the DeFiChain ecosystem and extend financial support where necessary and applicable. Per the recent monthly report, the DeFiChain Accelerator continues to build momentum and will focus on the US market for now. Additionally, there is growing momentum among companies looking to build on DeFiChain, although there is more work to do. Despite the current crypto market conditions, global interest in DeFi on Bitcoin keeps rising. As the DeFiChain community continues to thrive, itwill be interesting to see what will be built on DeFiChain over the coming months and years."
2022.7.6,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/06/blockchain-startup-boba-network-launches-bobascan-explorer-collaboration-etherscan/,"Back in April, we wrote about Boba Network after theEthereum blockchain startupjoined the coveted unicorn club following a $45M in funding led by Will Smith and Paris Hilton-backed VC firms. Fresh from a Series A funding round, today Boba Network announced the launch of Bobascan Explorer,a Boba-centric version of the popular explorer for EVM blockchains. The launch was done in collaboration with Etherscan. Over the years,Etherscan has cemented itself as the most used block explorer for Ethereum transactions, thanks to a large number of features that help users make sense of the blockchain. Now, with Bobascan, Boba Network users will be able to access the same analysis tools available on Ethereum. These include the “verified contracts” feature that allows teams to load their contract’s source code, which is then compared to the actual bytecode deployed at a particular address. This ensures that users can analyze the code they’re interacting with and be sure that everything is working according to expectations. Bobascan will also feature additional, much-needed features such as Proxy analysis. Proxy contracts are upgradable programs that delegate all transactions to an “implementation” contract. However, without a proper block explorer implementation, users will only see a cryptic interaction with the proxy and not the underlying code. Developers will also be able to use Bobascan APIs to read blockchain data, as they offer a powerful alternative to native tools that directly index node data, which is perfect for less mission-critical uses. Founded in 2017 byAlan Chiu,Boba is a next-generation Ethereum Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup scaling solution that enables users to develop decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain with more features and at lower fees, and also transfer non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across ethereum’s different layers. Ethereum’s “gas” fees, or the price of executing transactions, have risen steeply in recent years as the blockchain became more popular, giving rise to platforms designed to reduce expenses and speed up transactions. Unlike other Ethereum platforms, Boba reduces gas fees, improves transaction throughput, and extends the capabilities of Ethereum. Our Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalent Layer 2 ORU helps Ethereum smart contracts scale while delivering a delightful user experience. Boba Network is an optimistic-based Layer-2 scaling solution with additional development focused on improving UX. Over time, Boba aims to unlock the rollup technology potential to bring more flexible blockchain computation. Currently, Boba is fully compatible with EVM-based tools and is deploying multichain support for both Moonbeam and Fantom. “Adding Etherscan functionality to Boba Network is another important step in our mission to give developers tools to build incredible web3 experiences. With improved search and navigation, and core tooling such as contract verification, API access, and improved proxy contract interaction, Bobascan just took the Boba builder experience to another level.” – Ino Murko, Engineering Manager, Enya.ai. “Working together with Boba Network will be beneficial to users, the two teams, and the rollup ecosystem as a whole,” added Matthew Tan, CEO and Founder of Etherscan. “In the complex environment of smart contracts, having equitable access to understanding the data is of critical importance.” Boba Network is a blockchain Layer-2 scaling solution and Hybrid Compute platform offering lightning fast transactions and fees up to 60x less than Ethereum. Our Hybrid Compute brings the power of Web2 on-chain, with smarter smart contracts that allow developers and creators to leverage off-chain compute and real-world data to offer an enriched experience unlike anything else on the market today. We’re delivering a faster, cheaper, smarter experience for blockchain’s next billion users. Founded in 2015, Etherscan is one of the earliest and longest-running independent projects built around Ethereum and its community with the mission of providing equitable access to blockchain data. Today,Etherscan is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for Ethereum, a decentralized smart contracts platform."

Berenson and Twitter reached a settlement last month. We first covered the story back in December 2021 whenBerenson filed a lawsuit against Twitter after he was permanently banned for correctly stating that covid “vaccine doesn’t stop inflection or transmission” In an email to thousands of his fans,Berenson wrote: “Let’s get the official statement – the reinstatement statement – out of the way first:The parties have come to a mutually acceptable resolution. I have been reinstated. Twitter has acknowledged that my tweets should have not led to my suspension at that time.” Berenson also added: “To recap:Last August, Twitter banned me after I got five strikes under its Covid-19 misinformation policy. Which meant I’d supposedly made “claims of fact” that were “demonstrably false or misleading” and “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm” (that’s the policy, that’s what it takes to get a strike, look it up).Now we come to find those tweets “should not have led to my suspension”?Oopsie.Hey, everybody makes mistakes.” In a pinned post this morning, Berenson also tweeted: “It doesn’t stop infection.Or transmission.Don’t think of it as a vaccine.Think of it – at best – as a therapeutic with a limited window of efficacy and terrible side effect profile that must be dosed IN ADVANCE OF ILLNESS. And we want to mandate it? Insanity.” It doesn’t stop infection.Or transmission. Don’t think of it as a vaccine. Think of it – at best – as a therapeutic with a limited window of efficacy and terrible side effect profile that must be dosed IN ADVANCE OF ILLNESS. And we want to mandate it?Insanity. — Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson) July 6, 2022  We first wrote about Berenson back in June 2020 after his book was censored and banned by retail giant Amazon.A few days later, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and other public figures came to his defense, andAmazon later reversed its decision. But the censorship didn’t end there. About a month later,Twitter suspended Berenson for one weekafter he tweeted the results of the Pfizer clinical test. In a statement, Berenson said: “For this tweet, which is completely accurate and does nothing but quote PFIZER’S OWN CLINICAL TRIAL DATA. Welcome to the Brave New World. I probably have about one strike left after this. And it’s gonna go quick. If you care about free speech, protest to Twitter, not that it will matter. And please, please, please tell everyone to sign up here. I will do as much as I can on here.” His account was reinstated the following day but he wasn’t out of the woods yet. A few days later,Berenson posted a series of tweets spotlighting an Israeli preprint study that showed that natural immunity from a prior Covid-19 infection is 13 times more effective than vaccines against the delta variant. The tweets went viral with aboutthree million impressions and over a quarter-million people interacted with the tweets before Twitter took them down.  Then on August 29, Twitter permanently suspended him after he posted a tweet that vaccines don’t stop infection or transmission. In the tweet, Berenson stated: “It doesn’t stop infection. Or transmission.”  In a statement, Berenson said, “Yes, that was Twitter banning me for writing that ‘It doesn’t stop infection. Or transmission.’” He went on to explain that the New England Journal of Medicine said the same thing he said but wasn’t banned. He also included a screenshot of the article. Hey, check out this “Perspective” piece that ran yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), maybe’s the world’s top medical journal:  In an email to his fans on SubStack, Berenson said, “Can’t wait to see Twitter’s lawyers try to explain this.”Meanwhile, NEJM is not the only organization saying that vaccinesdon’t stop infection or transmission.

About an hour ago we reported that crypto-asset broker Voyager Digital has field for bankruptcy a year after raising $100 million in funding. The announcement makes Voyager the third crypto company to fall on the sworddue to exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which went bust last week after defaulting on loans from a number of firms in the industry — including $650 million from Voyager. The other two were Celsius and BlockFi. We now have the third casulty. This morning, CNBC is reporting that crypto lender Nexo has offered tobuy the embattled rival Vauld as the latter struggles to stay afloat.Nexo said it had signed a term sheet, with Vauld giving it 60 days of exclusive talks to explore an all-equity acquisition of the company. Nexo added it plans to restructure Vauld and pursue expansion in Southeast Asia and India, if successful. The announcement comes just a day afterValud suspended its customers from withdrawing their funds, citing ongoing financial issues.

Fast forward a little over a year later,Voyager Digital has gone kaput. Yesterday,Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionin the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, according to a filing from the company.The filing includes assets of between $1 billion and $10 billion and liabilities in the same range. The bankruptcy news comes just a week after another crypto lending firm went belly up amid the ongoing crypto market carnage. Last week,Crypto exchange FTX bought the embattled crypto lender BlockFi for $25 million in a fire sale, a 99% discount from its $4.8 billion valuation in July 2021. Voyager and BlockFi are two of the crypto companies that suffered heavy losses due to their exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which went bust last week after defaulting on loans from a number of firms in the industry — including $650 million from Voyager. In late June, Voyagersuspended all customer trading, deposits, withdrawals and loyalty rewards,according to a statementreleased by the company.“This was a tremendously difficult decision, but we believe it is the right one given current market conditions,” saidStephen Ehrlich, CEO of lending company Voyager. In a statement, Voyager said it has roughly $1.3 billion of crypto on its platform and holds over $350 million in cash on behalf of customers at New York’s Metropolitan Commercial Bank. What about crypto investors? Voyager said the bankruptcy proceedings would enable it to implement a restructuring process so that it can reimburse its customers’ funds. The company added that customers with U.S. dollar deposits will regain access to their funds once a reconciliation and fraud prevention process with Metropolitan Commercial Bank is complete, Voyager was founded in 2017 by established Wall Street and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and veterans who teamed up to bring a better, more transparent, and cost-efficient alternative for trading crypto-assets to the marketplace.Its founders,Gaspard de Dreuzy, Oscar Salazar, Philip Eytan, Serge Kreiker, and Stephen Ehrlich, also have combined decades’ worth of experience from leading organizations like E*TRADE, Uber, TradeIt, and Lightspeed Financial."
2022.7.6,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/06/minima-achieves-unparalleled-decentralization-120k-blockchain-nodes/,"Minima, the ultra-lean blockchain protocol that’s designed to run on low-powered smartphones and “internet of things” devices, said it has grown to encompass more than 120,000 nodes worldwide. It’s an impressive achievement for the protocol, which was founded back in 2018 on the idea that every user of its network should be able to participate in running and validating blockchain transactions. Minima has created a wet dream for fans of decentralization, building a network that’s not only scalable and inclusive but also secure and resilient to attacks. With such a high level of decentralization, it is one of the most censorship-resistant networks around, as no centralized body will ever be able to take control of its blockchain. With complete decentralization, there is no attack surface nor are there any third-party agendas that might be able to manipulate the system. Rather, Minima is a network based on the idea of equality, with every user playing an equal role in maintaining the system, enabling participation, collaboration, and empowerment of individuals. Minima has achieved this by creating a lightweight blockchain client that can run on almost any kind of device. To do this it uses advanced compression and “pruning” techniques. Each device stores only a part of the blockchain, plus its own transactions, with some clever algorithms that ensure coins can’t be double-spent. Participating in Minima is as simple as downloading an app, which runs in the background on the device with no performance impact. What’s more, Minima’s blockchain is as capable as any of its rivals, with support for token transfers, NFTs, and smart contracts. Minima’s milestone of 120,000 nodes is an impressive achievement but it aims to do much better, with a goal of having one million nodes up and running by the time its mainnet launches in the third quarter of the year. It’s a noble goal because Minima says the more nodes there are, the harder it will be for anyone to take control of its network. “Only when everyone can run the same version of the blockchain, with no hierarchy, can people truly enjoy the benefits of complete decentralization-empowered freedom and prosperity,” said Minima CEO Hugo Feiler."

Musk may soon walk away from the deals if his concerns are not addressed. According to a report from the Washington Post, Musk saidhe currently doesn’t have enough information to determine the level of fake accounts, which may force the billionaire to walk away from the deal altogether. As we reported back in early June,Twitteragreed to comply with Elon Musk’s bot data demands. But Musk claimed Twitter’s spam accounts are not verifiable, even after Twitter gave in to Musk’s demands to provide info on hundreds of millions of daily tweets. Early Thursday,Twitter, perhaps anticipating the Musk news, had a call with some members of the media outlets in which the social media giant said it removed 1 million spam accounts a day. During the meeting, Twitter also maintainedthat fake user accounts only represent less than 5% of its total user base, confirming what the company had said earlier in its quarterly earnings.

Instead of focusing on the big insurance market,Orus decided to pick a different path. It wants to provide tailored insurance services to underserved small businesses. Even with all the technological advancements of the 21st century, the insurance industry is still plagued with paperwork and antiquated processes. In addition,the specialty professional insurance sector is also dominated by big players with little to no innovation.And that’s about to change. Today, specialty professional insurance is to some extent a bit murky. As a small business, you never really know if it’s worth getting one and how much it’s going to cost your business and what to do if something goes wrong, and many other questions. That’s where Orus comes in–to do the heavy lifting so small businesses can focus on growing their businesses and supporting their customers. Launched in May 2021, Orus is aiming to capture the professional insurance market which is estimated to be worth about $70.1 billion. “Our goal isto enable professionals to develop their business with complete peace of mind, without spending too much time on administration,” Orus said on its website. Today,Orus announced it has raised$5.08 million (€5 million) in its first fundraisingto help small businesses with their insurance needs. up the market. The round was backed by VC firms Frst, Partech, Portage Ventures and around twenty business angels such as Pierre-Olivier Desaulle (ex-CEO of Hiscox Europe), Raphaël Vullierme (CEO of Luko), Arthur Waller (CEO of Pennylane), and Christophe Triquet (ex-founder of MeilleureAssurance). Over the years, traditional insurers have neglected small businesses because they’re considered too small and too costly to be able to create tailor-made products, adapted to their needs. As a result, about 24 million European small businesses (99% of all businesses) are still struggling to find simple, flexible, and tailored insurance offers. In France alone, these small businessesrepresent more than 45% of jobs and 40% of added value. The founders of Orus saw the neglect as an opportunity to address these issues and also make a difference by helping small businesses. So In May 2021, Côme Dartiguenave, Tom Le Bras, and Samuel Rossille dediced to launch Orus. In a statement,Orus co-founder and CEO Côme Dartiguenave said: “We believe that insurance is a social good to protect businesses. SMEs are the lifeblood of our economy and must be able to access the most suitable offer for their needs. Our mission is to create simple, efficient and affordable insurance to allow professionals to focus on what matters.” Fast forward a year since its launch, several dozen restaurant owners now trust thePartech-backed startupto insure their businesses 100% online. Orius now enables customers to purchase insurance directly online in less than 5 minutes, without any commitment, and with all the essential guarantees brought together under a single policy. Commenting on the funding, Alison Imbert, Principal at Partech, said: “Orus is tackling the professional insurance market, which is more complex than others due to the multitude of insurance products but also generates more value. Customers are more loyal and willing to pay a fair price for an efficient and transparent service. Orus has assembled an exceptional and complementary team to build a competitive product that is tailored to the many needs of its customers.” “Our technology will allow us to offer products, assistance, and prevention services to many small businesses, with a seamless experience and affordable prices,”Côme Dartiguenave added. Meanwhile, Orius said it plans to develop new products in the coming months in order to rapidly cover most business sectors and become a leader in professional insurance in Europe."

The lack of reliable natural alternatives with respect to quality and cost-efficiency has made the use of natural food colors a huge challenge for the food industry. EnterPhytolon,a Misgav, Israel-based food technology startup that offers a technology designed for the production of natural food colorants using bakers yeast cells as bio-factory. The company specializes in fermentation to create a natural food colorant. We coveredPhytolon two years ago after the startup closed $4.1 million in funding for its fermentation-based technology for the production of plant-based food colors. The investment was backed by Millennium Food-Tech, EIT Food, (Europe’s leading food innovation initiative), Consensus Business Group (CBG), and others. Since its last funding,Phytolon has received the attention of new investors and VC firms. Today,Phytolon announced it has secured $14.5 million in funding led by DSM Venturing, with participation from Cibus Fund, Ginkgo Bioworks (in-kind investment in the form of Foundry services), and The Trendlines Agrifood Fund. Other backers also include some of Phytolon’s current shareholders: The Trendlines Group (the largest shareholder in the company), Arkin Holdings, Millennium Foodtech, Agriline (administered by Consensus Business Group), Stern Tech, and OpenValley/Yossi Ackerman. Phytolon will use the new capital infusion tofurther progress its technology towards commercialization. Phytolon was founded in 2018 based on licensed technology through the Weizmann Institute of Science. The company leverages a proprietary, fermentation-based technology to produce plant-based food colors.Since its inception two years ago, Phytolon has been awarded many accolades: a finalist at MassChallenge Israel 2020, AgriVest 2019, Slingshot 2019, and a runner-up in the Calcalist-Tnuva Foodtech 2019 competition. In a statement,Phytolon Co-founder and CEO Dr.Halim Jubransaid: “The investments of DSM Venturing, Cibus Fund, and Ginkgo Bioworks open the door for broad penetration of our products in the global food industry. We are excited to have new investors who share our vision to create healthy, efficient, and sustainable food systems via biotechnology.” Since current natural food colors are agriculture-dependent and mostly derived from fruit and vegetables, Phytolon’s technology produces betalain pigments by fermentation of baker’s yeast. Phytolon offers a wide range of natural colors from yellow to purple, at competitive coloring performance and cost-in-use, for multiple food categories like alternative meat, dairy, frozen products, baked goods, confectionery, and snacks."
2022.7.7,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/07/bankman-fried-founder-ceo-crypto-exchange-ftx-says-company-billion-support-embattled-crypto-industry/,"FTX,one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has become the savior of the crypto industry as about half a dozen crypto companies became the casualties of the sudden crypto carnage. Last week,FTX bought the beleaguered crypto lender BlockFi for $25 million, a 99% discount from its $4.8 billion valuation in July 2021. BlockFi is not alone.FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto-trading firm, Alameda Research, also gave crypto-asset broker Voyager Digital a $200 million cash and stablecoin revolving credit facility, and a facility of bitcoin before the company filed for bankruptcy this Tuesday,a little over a year after raising $100 million in funding. BlockFi and Voyager are two of the crypto companies that suffered heavy losses due to their exposure to crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which went bust last week after defaulting on loans from a number of firms in the industry. Others include Census Network and Vauld. In May,Bankman-Fried revealed he had personally taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood Markets Inc, capitalizing on the trading app’s weakened share price. There were speculations thatFTX wanted to buy fintech startup and commission-free trading app Robinhood. However, he quickly dispelled the rumor. Bankman-Fried said he and his companyhave a “few billion” on hand to help struggling crypto companies that could further destabilize the embattled crypto industry. He also allayed fear about the ongoing crisis in the crypto market, adding that theworst of the liquidity crunch has likely passed. “We’re starting to get a few more companies reaching out to us,” Bankman-Fried said in an interview. Those firms are generally not in dire situations, though some smaller crypto exchanges may still fail, he said, adding that the industry has moved beyond “other big shoes that have to drop.” Bankman-Fried, 30, who is from California but lives in the Bahamas where FTX is based, has become crypto’s white knight in recent weeks, throwing lifelines to digital asset platforms which have faltered as cryptocurrencies prices have cratered. Bitcoin is down around 70% from its all-time November high of nearly $69,000. As we reported last month,FTX also gave BlockFi a $250 million revolving credit facility and on Friday announced a deal giving FTX the right to purchase it based on certain performance triggers.Bankman-Fried said thegoal of the bailouts was to “protect customer assets and stop contagion from ricocheting through the system.” “Having trust with consumers that things will work as advertised is incredibly important and if broken is incredibly hard to get back,” he said.“It does get increasingly expensive with each one of these,” Bankman-Fried said, adding that the firm still had enough cash on hand to do a $2 billion deal if necessary. “If all that mattered was one single event, we could get above a couple billion,” he said, stressing that isn’t his preference. On one or two occasions, Bankman-Fried, who made billions arbitraging cryptocurrency prices in Asia beginning in 2017, said he has used his own cash to backstop failing crypto companies when it didn’t make sense for FTX to do so. “FTX has shareholders and we have a duty to do reasonable things by them and I certainly feel more comfortable incinerating my own money,” he said. FTX was founded in 2019 by 29-year-old MIT graduate Sam Bankman-Fried andhis co-founder Gary Wang. The Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTXoffers derivatives products like futures and options as well as spot trading. Once an unknown startup, FTX has become a key player in the crypto space, rivaling the likes of Coinbase and Binance. Bankman-Fried, who currently resides in Hong Kong, is now worth at least $25 billionmaking him the richest person in crypto, according to Forbes.Sam graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013 at the age of 21. He was skilled in math and loved to solve problems and give back to society. With $2 billion in total funding since its inception three years ago, FTX has built up a war chest at a time when digital currency prices have sunk considerably. However, Bankman-Fried doesn’t think we’re entering a “long-term crypto winter.” In an interview with CNBC,Bankman-Fried said,“I think we’re not entering a long-term crypto winter.There have been changes in expectations of interest rates, and that’s been moving crypto markets. But it’s been moving markets more generally as well.” In 2020, Bankman-Fried made headlines after he donated a whopping $5.2 million to Joe Biden’s campaign, making him the second-biggest donor. Today,Sam is a celebrity in crypto circles.FTX specializes in derivatives and trading on leverage, the use of borrowed funds to amplify trades.

As part of that commitment, SSV DAO isdistributing grants to development teams to help decentralize Ethereum’s consensus layer in preparation for its transition to POS (‘the merge’). The SSV DAO, which holds over $10M in assets after partnering with prominent industry leaders such as Coinbase, DCG, and Okex, is now doubling down on building the staking infrastructure needed for other decentralized staking applications. They encourage developers to apply for grants and participate in bug bounties and incentivized testnets. Emerging projects in collaboration with the likes of Swell, Rated Network, and RockX are already innovating the network. The DAO is allocating over $3 million to open and pre-defined grants aimed toward developers to build applications, staking pools, and other tools needed by the network. An additional $3 million is earmarked for bug bounties, while a whopping $4 million is available for incentivized programs for early adopters and testers. The DAO will allocate these assets in USDC, ETH, and SSV tokens. Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is crucial in Ethereum’s roadmap towards a fully functional and scalable Ethereum 2.0, and ssv.network has positioned itself as Ethereum’s security layer, or Layer 0. Ethereum’s coming transition to Proof-of-Stake and the enormous popularity of Eth staking require a secure and decentralized infrastructure. Since March, companies, and builders in the space like RockX, Swell, Forbole, and Ankr have submitted and received roughly $1M in approved grant requests. The objective now is to scale the program and invite more companies and developers to build on top of the SSV protocol. According to Protocol Lead Alon Muroch, “The Ethereum community has identified DVT as a crucial component in ensuring that the protocol remains decentralized and secure. We encourage development teams to join the Grant Program and unlock distributed staking on Ethereum for the next billion users.” ssv.network provides a stable infrastructure for developers to build liquid staking protocols, delegation services, and staking pools, and it solves the fundamental issues of centralization, scalability, and security that have existed since Ethereum’s inception. Exchanges, DAOs, staking providers, and even highly technical at-home validators transitioning to PoS Eth staking can benefit. The recent market downturn is an excellent opportunity for teams working on key blockchain infrastructure pieces to double down on their mission and execute aggressively. ssv.network will launch on Ethereum’s mainnet in 2022, and now is the perfect time for us to ramp up our efforts by building a flourishing developer ecosystem using the DAO’s resources."
2022.7.7,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/07/solflare-simplify-accounts-solana-defi-nft-users-one-app-ftx-integration/,"Solflare, the Solana-native wallet Solflare, today released a key integration with cryptocurrency exchange FTX.com and FTX.us to simply portfolio management for Solana DeFi and NFT users. The newFTX integration letsusers manage Solana CeFi and DeFi accounts in one app. Users can now connect their FTX.com and FTX US accounts to Solflare, allowing them to manage their funds in the exchange directly from the Solflare web extension and later on via the mobile wallet. The integration aims to connect the world of Web2 and Web3 into one seamless interface, utilizing the rich FTX ecosystem to supplement Solflare’s Solana dApp experience. Users can withdraw and deposit assets to their FTX accounts seamlessly. Depositing on FTX becomes a simple transfer transaction from Solflare and automates a previously manual process. For any token that is supported by the applicable FTX exchange, Solflare simply fetches the user’s deposit address and sends the desired amount of funds to it. The reverse transaction is just as simple, as Solflare allows withdrawing assets from the exchange with one click. An even more useful integration is FTX Convert, which is a Solflare native function that allows users to easily swap tokens on the user’s FTX balance with other tokens, directly within the wallet. The integration can be used to supplement Raydium/Serum liquidity with the deep books of FTX via a seamless three-click process from the Solflare app. Solflare also supports FTX NFTs with full withdrawal, deposit and visualization functionality. The integration seamlessly connects the two worlds and can result in important benefits for the Solana DeFi ecosystem. Connecting FTX to the user’s Solflare account “verifies” that wallet as a unique human being, relying on the KYC system for the appropriate exchange. This can make it very simple for Solana projects to work with Solflare and do things like efficiently target airdrops and other incentive mechanisms for its DeFi users. “FTX is probably one of the most popular centralized exchanges for DeFi users, especially on Solana,” said Filip Dragoslavic, co-founder of Solflare. “Integrating the two connects both worlds and turns it all into one seamless experience. You can command your FTX account without ever leaving Solflare, and confirming that your wallet address is indeed one unique human registered on FTX might enable many, new web3 opportunities.” Solflare is a community-created wallet built specifically for Solana. Solflare supports sending and receiving native SOL tokens as well as sending and receiving SPL Tokens (Solana’s ERC-20 equivalent). Solflare also supports staking of SOL tokens, advanced NFT interactions, DeFi protocol usage, and many more advanced features like dApp notifications. The Solflare Mobile wallet is the first Solana-native mobile wallet with complete support for advanced DeFi, NFT, and staking interactions, as well as Ledger support."

NSO Groupis a cybersecurity tech startup most Americans probably never heard of. But NSO Group is not new to hacking into the devices of high-profile individuals. In 2018, the startupwas accused of placing spyware on the smartphone of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, though the Israeli firm denied the accusations. ButApple is now fighting back with a new strategy that placessecurity over convenience, while maintaining iPhone users’ experience. This week, Apple announced it’s rolling outa new “Lockdown Mode” option that will allow millions of its users to disable some of the iPhone features that have proven vulnerable to government spyware and hackers. The new feature will be included in theupcoming iPhone and Mac software and is expected to protect users against mercenary spyware unleashed by state-sponsored hackers. In a statement,Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of Security Engineering and Architecture, said:“Apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market. Lockdown Mode is a groundbreaking capability that reflects our unwavering commitment to protecting users from even the rarest, most sophisticated attacks.” Krstić continued: “While the vast majority of users will never be the victims of highly targeted cyberattacks, we will work tirelessly to protect the small number of users who are. That includes continuing to design defenses specifically for these users, as well as supporting researchers and organizations around the world doing critically important work in exposing mercenary companies that create these digital attacks.” In addition to the new feature, Apple also announced a$10 million grant to bolster research to expose “highly targeted cyberattacks.” The iPhone giant added that the two initiatives will help protect users who may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. According to Apple, the “Lockdown Mode offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Turning on Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware.”  Israel cybersecurity startup NSO Group made headlines back in 2016 after its impossible-to-detect software, Pegasus, was used to hack Apple iPhone 6 running iOS version 9.3.4. In June 2019,NSO reportedly used its spyware to spy on Apple, Google and Facebook cloud data; but the company denied the allegation.Now, the startup is under fire and being sued by social media giant Facebook over its alleged hacking of WhatsApp users earlier this year. Founded about 12 years ago, theTel Aviv, Israel-based NSO Group developstechnology that helps government agencies prevent and investigate terrorism and crime to save thousands of lives around the globe."
2022.7.8,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/08/revuto-launches-lifetime-subscription-netflix-spotify-nfts/,"Just a few weeks afterRevutoannounced itsnon-fungible token (NFT) marketplace in partnership with Cardahub, the Croatian subscription management startup today announced it is launching NFTs for lifetime subscriptions to Netflix and Spotify. As part of the launch, Revuto will sell NFTs that will allow the users to enjoy lifelong subscriptions to their favorite streaming services at stable prices and with the possibility of making a profit. Dubbed Revulution NFT, the new digitallifetime subscription will“revulutionize” how people subscribe to services while allowing them to subscribe to any service in the world for any period of time and send or sell (monetize) unused subscription periods to others. According to the information shared with Tech Startups, Revulution NFT collection is set to launch onJuly 11 and will be made available on Revuto’s website, where atotal of 10,000 interested users will be able to purchase a limited edition NFT. In a statement, Revuto co-founder and CEOVedran Vukman said:“Based on the feedback we received from our 350,000 active and verified users, we have decided to give the community exactly what they have asked for – a solution that guarantees a stable subscription fee, that they can share with their friends or family members in a simple and straightforward way. Moreover, in case they are not using the service, the users can simply get their money back or even profit from selling the NFTs. We wish to enable everyone to efficiently manage their subscriptions and, eventually, to make the digital subscription market fairer and more equitable.” After completing the purchase, Revuto will, in cooperation with Railsr (former Railsbank) top tier banking provider powering, among others, Crypto.com, provide the user with a digital debit card to pay for their Netflix or Spotify subscriptions. Furthermore, the Revulution NFT enables trading at the crypto exchanges, thus opening a completely new, secondary digital subscription market. Once the user sells their NFT, Revuto will deactivate their digital debit card and provide the new user with a new virtual card to pay for their Netflix or Spotify subscriptions. “Our Revulution NFT for Netflix or Spotify is just the start, and also an introduction to the subscription NFTs that people will be able to use to pay for any subscription in the world, for however long they want. Also, by using this particular innovation, the users will get discounts when selecting their subscriptions, coupled with the possibility of either gifting or selling them to other users. With such a unique approach, Revuto is introducing something completely new to the world of subscriptions, something that will enable the creation of an entirely new market of prepaid unused subscriptions. I am immensely proud of the team behind this project, and we are all looking forward to everything that is coming in the future. We are confident the market and existing user base will once again react positively to what we have done,” added Josipa Majić, cofounder of Revuto. The limited edition of Revulution NFTs will be available on Revuto’s website at the price of $349, and the sale will kick off at 12 pm CET on July 11. Users will be able to pay for the Revuto NFT with credit or debit cards or using crypto. We covered Revuto back in Januaryafter it featured a concurrent listing of its REVU token On Gate.io & KuCoin Exchanges.Revutoisthe first dApp built on Cardano and a one-stop subscription management and payments solution. Using the Revuto dApp, users can approve, block, and snooze their subscription payments for any service from a unified dashboard within seconds."

The announcement comes just six months after theSoftBank-backed startup raised$260 million in funding at a valuation of $4.8 billion. In an interview with Reuters, Creditas CEOSergio Furio said the startup is acquiring the Brazilian banking license of Andbank,the oldest commercial bank that provides a wide range of banking services to private and corporate clients in Andorra andhas $30 billion under management The deal, which is valued at $100 million, still has to be approved by Brazil’s central bank and antitrust watchdog CADE.Before the latest fundraising, Creditas previously funded itself only through the capital markets. In a statement,Furio told Reuters,“Getting retail deposits as a new alternative for funding will improve our margins.” As part of the acquisition agreement, Andbank will continue operating in Brazil as a broker-dealer and asset manager while Creditas will distribute products from its credit portfolio to Andbank investors. In addition, Andbank will also become a minority shareholder in Creditas. As we reported back in January, Andbank also participated in a $50 million extension of the funding round Series F, in which Creditas raised $260 million at a $4.8 billion valuation in January. In the same interview, Andbank CEO Carlos Aso said, “selling the banking license will reduce its capital needs, allowing growth in private banking and wealth management.” Founded in 2012 by Sergio Furio, a Spanish former consultant, theSao Paulo, Brazil-basedCreditas operates a digital platform providing secured loans and low-interest rates.

2022.7.9,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.7.9,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.7.9,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher.

2022.7.10,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.7.10,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment.

Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness.

Thegrowing demand for drones from organizations and the government has pushed theglobal drone market to an estimated$100 billion industry. From package delivery to infrastructure inspection, mapping, and transportation, the commercial use of drones is expected to revolutionize countless applications. However,large-scale drone operations, especially in urban areas, depend on getting access to shared airspace and providing autonomous, safe operations anytime and anywhere. In addition, operatinga commercial drone, for example, a retailer delivery drone requires multiple people to keep a line of sight from take-off to landing. This is unscalable and time-consuming.That’s where Wonder Robotics comes in. Wonder Robotics is a Tel Aviv, Israel-based robotics tech startup thatspecializes in the autonomous flight and landing of commercial drones.Recognizing thatdrones’ complex and diversified vision requirements cannot be satisfied by 2D or 3D vision capture alone, Wonder Robotics has developed a computer vision technology that dramatically improves perspective, classification, shading, texture, and motion cues. Wonder Robotics’vision technology is modeled after and inspired by a human vision-based replica, which uniquely transcends prior art by combining short-range 3D depth perception with a long-range 2D vision. To furtherscale up its operation,Wonder Robotics announced today it has closed$4 million in seed funding led by Elron Ventures, with participation from Besadno Investment Group.Wonder Robotics will also use the funding proceeds todevelop anew solution that allows drones to land safely and autonomously while developing technology for additional applications and enabling commercial use of drones at scale. Founded by CEO Idan Shimon, CTO Amnon Demri, and CBO Or Epstein,Wonder Robotics is a provider of intelligent and robust AI layers for autonomous and safe flights for both commercial and military drones using advanced vision-based capabilities.  Safe autonomous operation is this market’s enabler and at the heart of the rapidly developing drone regulation, and is being strongly promoted by the biggest industry players. Currently, the technology for operating drones beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is lacking, which hinders the ability to provide safe, autonomous drone flights, making the commercialization of drones expensive and unscalable. As a response, Wonder Robotics developed their unique “WonderLand” for precise autonomous landings, that can be installed on any drone. Clearing landing zones in real-time, enables emergency autonomous contingency landings, in unprepared, uncharted, and unattended sites. Wonder Robotics’ smart safety layer includes vertical awareness and robust precision landing, permitting drone safety beyond the operator/mission manager’s visual line of sight. In urban environments, this can prevent collisions with people and natural and infrastructural impediments such as trees, cables, buildings, and other dynamic environmental factors. In a statement, Wonder Robotics co-founder and CEO Idan Shimon said, “We are thrilled to take part in the drone revolution, by partnering with major industry players leveraging on our technology to launch their commercial multi-drone operations.”Shimon added: “Since raising the seed round, we have partnered with Spright, Air Methods’ new drone division, helping it realize its mission to improve access to urgently needed medical supplies for healthcare providers.” “Wonder Robotics’ founding team are true industry experts and have the knowledge and technical expertise needed to enable a market waiting to take off, and establish WonderLand as an industry standard,” said Lauren Duke, Vice President of Business Development at Elron Ventures. “Our investment in Wonder Robotics is perfectly aligned to our strategy of investing in domains where we can provide added value, by leveraging on our strategic partnership with Rafael and its validation platform for deep-tech ventures,” added Kobi Katz, Partner, and CTO at Elron Ventures and former VP and CIO at Rafael.

However, the best US fighter jets still rely on SATCOM avionics, an airbornevoice and data service that allows an aircraft to communicate via satellite. The GPSis a constellation of orbiting satellites that provides navigation data to civilian and military all around the globe. In 2018, the United States Air Force turned off theGlobal Positioning System (GPS) satellites to rehearse a war without it them. The result is “the largest Red Flag ever with the largest number of participants, highlighting the balance of training efficiency with mission effectiveness,”Col. Michael Mathes said.Fast forward four years later, the Air Force’s worst fear has been realized. According to an investigation reported by Space News,recent Google Earth images revealed the construction of what appears to be a sophisticated laser system at a Russian space facility designed to blind enemy satellites.The construction is taking place at the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Krona space facility near Zelenchukskaya in Russia’s far southwest,a place well known in the astronomical community and thehome of the massive RATAN-600 radio telescope. The existence of the new complex was first reported by theopen-source investigationand published in The Space Review. Among others, the report analyzed public satellite imagery, solicitation documents from Russian industrial contractors, and other Russian financial documents.  In a statement, The Space Review authorBart Hendrickx wrote: “There is strong evidence that a space surveillance complex in Russia’s northern Caucasus is being outfitted with a new laser system called Kalina that will target optical systems of foreign imaging satellites flying over Russian territory. Initiated in 2011, the project has suffered numerous delays, but recent Google Earth imagery shows that construction is now well underway. Kalina will complement a mobile laser dazzler known as Peresvet that has been operational since late 2019.” According to Hendrickx,Kalina complements a mobile laser dazzler known as Peresvet that has been operational since late 2019. The Kalina is part of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Krona (“tree crown”) space surveillance complex, which consists of a radar system (designated 40Zh6) and a lidar (designated 30Zh6), which are several kilometers apart. “The lidar (literally referred to in Russian as a “laser-optical locator” or LOL) is situated on top of a two-kilometer-high mountain called Chapal (its exact coordinates being 43°43’2″N, 41°13’41″E). Krona was conceived back in the mid-1970s (among other things to provide targeting data for Soviet anti-satellite systems), but didn’t become operational until early this century. The radar system is mainly intended to furnish LOL with accurate trajectory data to point its telescopes at targets of interest,”Hendrickx explained. The laser-optical locatorcomprises a 1.3-meter narrow-angle telescope with adaptive optics for high-resolution imaging of satellites in low orbits and a 0.4-meter wide-angle telescope for the detection of satellites in high orbits.  Below is a video of Kalina works."
2022.7.11,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/11/google-startups-announces-50-recipients-inaugural-latino-founders-fund/,"Back in June 2021, we wrote aboutGoogle for Startups after itannounced the launch of a second $5 million Black Founders Fund. Unlike the traditional venture capital funding, the founders received non-dilutive cash awards and did not give up any ownership in their company in exchange for funding. Now, the tech giant is doubling down its effort to support another underserved minority group. Today,Google for Startups announced 50 recipients of its $5M inaugural Google for Startups Latino Founders Fund.In an event this morning at the Unidos US conference in San Antonio, Texas, Google said the fund will provide promising US Latino-led startups non-equity cash awards to help fuel their businesses. The fund was partof Google’s $15 million commitment to economic equity for Latinos in the U.S announced last year. Currently,Latino-led startups as an aggregate have never received more than 2% of venture capital funding, despite comprising 20% of the population. As part of the funding, the tech giant said50 Latino founders across the country will each receive $100K in cash to help grow their business. In addition, they will also receive hands-on support from Google employees across the company, $100K in Google Cloud credits, and access to therapy to support founders emotionally and professionally. The goal of the fund is to help Latino entrepreneurs have equitable access to funding, training, and the support they need to succeed in today’s economy. The hope is that this funding and support can catalyze the growth of Latino-led startups, foster innovative solutions to tough problems, and ultimately generate wealth for Latino communities. The Google for Startups Latino Founders Fund is a part of a broader commitment to expand the Latino startup community in the US. Earlier this year, Google for Startups announced new support for organizations already nurturing community-building among Latino-led startups, such as: o Miami’s eMerge Americas (FL):Connects founders across North and Latin America through our partnership with eMerge Americas. o Inicio Ventures (CA): Recently wrapped its first Latinx Leaders Summit with Inicio Ventures, and will host a series of pitch competitions for aspiring entrepreneurs later this year. o Visible Hands (MA): Teams up with Visible Hands to launch VHLX, a new program to support Latino entrepreneurs at the earliest stages of their process; those founders received $10,000 in cash stipends from Google to help kickstart their ideas. In a blog post, Daniel Navarro ofGoogle for Startups wrote: “We know having a robust network of support is critical to Latino founders’ success. That’s why we committed $1 million to supporting organizations that are dedicated to growing the Latino startup community.” Tanya Menendez and Pamela Martinez, cofounders of Snowball Wealth According to Google,Latino-led businesses are the fastest-growing segment of U.S. small businesses, but as an aggregate, they only receive 2% of total U.S. venture capital funding, despite comprising 20% of the U.S. population. “This disparity is why we committed $7 million last year to help Latino founders grow their businesses and support the organizations already nurturing communities of Latino-led startups. We allocated $5 million of that funding to our inaugural Google for Startups Latino Founders Fund, and today at the UnidosUS Annual Conference in San Antonio, we revealed the 50 Latino founders who will each receive $100,000 in cash awards. They’ll also receive hands-on support and mentorship from Googlers across the company, $100,000 in Google Cloud credits, and access to therapy sessions to use as needed for any support they may need emotionally and professionally,” Navarro wrote"

The situation is so bad thatone in three European startups are now considering launching their business elsewhere due to the scale of the compliance burden. But the regulatory burden is probably now the least of their worries asEuropean countries continue to experience a prolonged period of economic and energy crises as the war between Russia and Ukraine rages on. For the first time in two decades, the Euro, the common currency of the eurozone, is now at parity with the US dollar as Europe suffers one of the worst economic crises in a generation. The fall is also forcing currency traders to prepare for a world where one euro is worth less than a dollar. As of the time of writing, one Euro is now trading at $1.01.But the fall could even get worse.  Some analysts are saying Euro’s fall is far from over, there’s a possibility it could fall even further.George Saravelos, Global Head of FX Research at Deutsche suggested that “safe-haven” moves towards the U.S. dollar could become “even more extreme” as the U.S. enters a technical recession, thereby putting more downward pressure on the EURUSD trade.Saravelos said: “We conclude that a move down to 0.95-0.97 in EUR/USD would match the all-time extremes seen in exchange rates and USD risk premium since the end of Bretton Woods.” Other analysts attributed thedecline to a number of macro events including fears of a recession and rising uncertainty about energy supply to the bloc caused by sanctions on Russia. So, what does this mean for technology startups?The exchange rate between the two currencies may further cause instability for European startups looking to raise new funds. The rate fluctuation and volatility could also hamper their effort to plan their future operations."

As investors shrugged off the news of a recession, the NFT boom that started early last year continues without any sign of slowing down. From relatively meager sales under $100 million in 2020, NFT transactions skyrocketed to hit $25 billion in 2021 as VC firms poured millions into promising tech startup companies. One of those startups isByzantion, a Fayetteville, Arkansas-based platform that is providing infrastructure for NFT traders and developers working with NFT data. Today,Byzantion announced it has closed nearly $1 millionto continue building a unified cross-chain NFT experience through its data infrastructure and marketplace.The pre-seed round was led by Hivemind, a thesis-driven crypto fund with a multi-strategy approach to backing web3 founders. Other backers include KCRise Fund, Backend Capital, and CryptoSlam, a leading NFT data and analytics platform backed by Animoca Brands, Mark Cuban, and Sound Ventures. Founded by Joshua Owen and Daniel Fritsche,Byzantion is an NFT platform for traders and developers.Byzantion claims to be the #1 Marketplace on Stacks where users can buy, sell, auction, and discover Bitcoin-Secured NFTs. The platform currently has over 600,000 Stacks NFTs on sale now, according to the information on its website. In addition, Byzantion provides a number of tools on its user interface that create a unified and complete trading platform for high-volume collectors. The platform also provides APIs and community tooling for NFT projects and developers giving builders a structured source of truth directly from the chain built specifically for NFTs, enabling them to go to market much more quickly. In a statement,Byzantion co-founder Joshua Owen said,“The rise of NFTs over the past year displayed not only a cultural phenomenon but also gave glimpses into the promising future use cases of this protocol and the technology surrounding it.” Owen also added:“However, both collectors and developers in the space lack a truly unified cross-chain experience with NFTs. With the capital from this round, we are excited to go out and build an infrastructure and marketplace layer for NFTs that can onboard the next wave of entrants into the space in a more seamless way.” “We believe users will increasingly interact cross-chain and that chains will be abstracted away with user interfaces, allowing seamless transactions between all digital assets with all digital currencies. To accomplish this, not only does a marketplace need to be built for users but the underlying NFT data and infrastructure needs to be unified. Our cross-chain approach will allow us to serve both NFT traders and developers working with NFT data,” said Daniel Fritsche, co-founder of Byzantion. “Byzantion tackles two promising fields in web3 at once: NFT infrastructure and the programmability of Bitcoin via STX,” said Jake Greenstein, Partner and Head of Infrastructure at Hivemind Capital. “We have been impressed by both the market traction and product progress made by the Byzantion team within a short period of time. We have confidence in the team’s ability to execute and bring Byzantion to the next level in the upcoming months.” Preceding this round and the rollout of its cross-chain expansion, Byzantion built the leading NFT infrastructure and trading platform on Stacks, a smart contract layer for Bitcoin. Not only is Byzantion a marketplace geared toward highly analytical traders but also an infrastructure platform serving NFT projects and developers in the space. Recently, Byzantion began its cross-chain approach and expanded to the NEAR protocol with NFT developer tooling and trading tools to follow."

As we reported late last month,at least 22,000 workers in the U.S. tech sector have been laid off in mass job cuts as of June 27. The impact of the current economic downturn is not limited to big companies, technology startups were also forced to let go of some of their staff as they struggle to raise new funds to support their operations and keep business afloat. Now, there’s a piece of good news coming out of England. Today, London and Brussels-based venture capital firmPario Ventures announced it is creating a $53.5 million (£45 million) fundto help support early-stage and scale-up tech startup companies in what looks like a challenging period coming up for the world economy. Pario Ventures was founded in 2010 by CEO David Murray-Hundley and Kevin Doyle.In a partnership that dates back to the pre-dotcom era, the duo has witnessed the economic ebb and flow that most startups face. In a statement,Murray-Hundley said,“The current changes to the financial markets will have an impact on companies that had planned funding to break even. Dotcom and GFC in 2008 show that funding becomes increasingly harder to get and capital more expensive. We are already seeing companies with 3x liquidation preferences negotiations with investors as a way of not publicly saying they have had to down round or flat round.” Pario Ventures also said it plans to launch a product called “unplugged” that will provide an accelerator-like program for companies that are facing challenges in the financial downturn. Kevin Doyle Co-Founder of Pario ventures “ We are particularly interested in supporting those companies that have broken even or are close to breaking even in this calendar year. That has a firm plan and a strong team. There are also a lot of companies in Europe that have bootstrapped and are close to doing first revenues, that sits in a unique position. Not only can we offer the financial side, but we can also support our experienced team based here in the UK and the US, who have decades of experience going through downturns and the startup ecosystem.” “ I recognize that it’s not always just about funding, that actually some companies might not fit most investment criteria and just need help or a program for support. Matt Stone at Pario Ventures has built a product that we hope to launch very shortly,” said David Murray-Hundley. To date,Pario Ventures has over 80 investments across the world. Its team is built up of seasoned entrepreneurs who have done billion-dollar IPOs on NASDAQ, and NYSE as well as involvement with Google, Total, Ariba, and Rivian. The firm holds investments in Oil and Gas, Automotive Mobility, Fintech, Green Tech, Space Tech, and others."

On Friday, Twitter’s chairman, Bret Taylor, also vowed that the social giant is pursuing legal action against Tesla CEO Elon Musk over the botched $44 billion takeover deal. In a post, Taylor wrote: “The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk…” The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery. — Bret Taylor (@btaylor) July 8, 2022  Musk responded to the lawsuit early this morning with a laughing meme below. The meme has a series of four photos of the Telsa founder laughing with captions that read: “They said I couldn’t buy Twitter; Then they wouldn’t disclose bot info; Now they want to force me to buy Twitter in court; Now they have to disclose bot info in court.” pic.twitter.com/JcLMee61wj — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 11, 2022  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, Musk said Twitter breached the deal because theSan Francisco-based company failedto provide him with enough information to back up its claim that spam or fake accounts constitute less than 5% of its active users. “Twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions of that Agreement, appears to have made false and misleading representations upon which Mr. Musk relied when entering into the Merger Agreement,” the filing reads. However, the social giant said it stands by this estimate but also said it’s possible the number of these accounts is higher. Musk’s main claim against Twitter is that the San Francisco-based company breached its deal because it will not share with him enough information to back up its claim that spam or fake accounts constitute less than 5% of its active users. Twitter has stood by this estimate but also said it’s possible the number of these accounts is higher. Meanwhile, legal experts said that Twitter has a strong legal case against Musk, but could decide to renegotiate the deal or settlement instead of a long legal fight. “We believe that Elon Musk’s intentions to terminate the merger are more based on the recent market sell-off than… Twitter’s ‘failure’ to comply with his requests,” Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note."

Other backers include4Founders Capital, Angels, Juan Roig’s investment firm part of Marina de Empresas, and Zone2Boost.The announcement comes a little over a year after the startup closed a €400,000 funding round led by 4Founders Capital, Itnig, and Angels. The ongoing post-pandemic e-commerce surge has led to the need for small and medium-sized brands, wholesalers, retailers, and chain shopsto digitize their processes or sell online with their own websites or on other marketplaces. Considering that only 20% of retail sales are online and that in the next few decades they will move to a 50/50 split, this is a much-needed technology for SMEs.The new round will help StockAgile to continue to expand its customer base by entering new retail verticals and geographical markets. The new fund will enable the five-year-old startup to position itself as a leader in the retail industry. Stockagile will also use part of the funding proceeds to enhance its platform’s offering and customer sales, as well as launch a new sales and marketing strategy. Stockagile was founded in 2017 by two brothers, Miquel and Joan Subirats. Engineers by profession, the duo quickly identified the lack of digitalization within SMEs in the retail sector. With the aim to support retailers in their end-to-end supply chain, the brothers launched Stockagile, a Software as a Service (SaaS) that connects the bricks and mortar and online operations by synchronizing catalogs, stock availability, and orders in real-time. Stockagile customers include small and medium businesses that sell physical products: brands, wholesalers, businesses, retail chains, e-commerce stores, or digital brands that need to digitalise their processes or need to centralize their online, in-store, and marketplace sales. In a statement,Miquel Subirats, co-founder and CEO of Stockagile, said: “The future of retail lies in agile ways of working, optimization, and automation. SMEs need to sell as much as possible with limited resources in order to survive; they can only achieve this through digitalization. Stockagile digitalizes processes and connects the different sales channels using the latest technology to help retailers earn more. We aim to reach a point where many of the retail processes are automated – from deciding price points to placing orders with suppliers.” Jordi Viñas, Barcelona-based Nauta Capital Partner, adds: “According to market research, it is expected that by 2040 in-store and online sales volumes will be similar, nowadays the split is closer to 20/80 respectively. Companies, such as Stockagile, that connect the offline and online worlds within the retail industry have experienced a boom following the pandemic and we believe this trend will continue, making them a vital part of retail’s future.” Marc Castilblanco, Principal at 4Founders Capital, highlights “the rapid growth rate that retail technology that helps digitalize and improve inventory management has had. After a year as investors, we pushed another round of funding given the high potential of the project and because we believe that Miquel and Joan can make Stockagile the go-to-solution in inventory management for the retail industry.” In 2021, Stockagile was selected to be part of Lanzadera, Juan Roig’s start-up incubator also part of Marina de Empresas. Shortly thereafter, Angels decided to participate in its first funding round and has once again invested in the company showcasing its confidence in the cloud-based platform. Pepe Peris, Managing Director at Angels, adds: “During our time as partners, Angels has had the opportunity to see first-hand Miquel’s leadership, attracting first-class talent and investors like Nauta Capital. This has led to a growth in their customer base; customers have benefited from the value add and efficiencies that Stockagile offers. We continue to support them on this journey knowing that the latest round will enable their offering to reach new heights.”"

According to the letter, which was first reported by Bloomberg, thelayoffs will affect about 1,500 employees whom the company said they will be informed throughout Tuesday. Gopuff now joins a series of tech companies that announced layoffs in recent months. In addition to the layoffs, the unicorn startup also said that it is also closing 76 warehouses, about 12% of its networks.“These shifts are not only accelerating our timeline to profitability, they are taking us back to our roots of keeping profitability at the core of every decision,” the letter reads. “As part of our efforts to remove overhead and drive operational efficiencies, we have made the incredibly challenging decision of reducing our global workforce by 10%,” the letter said. “While difficult, this restructures us to align more closely around business priorities while accelerating our path to profitability.” Founded in 2013 by two college studentsRafael Ilishayev and Yakir Gola while at Drexel University, the Pennsylvania-based GoPuffprovides quick-delivery services in 1,200 cities worldwide that count Selena Gomez among its investors. Gopuff alsoowns, operates, and stocks its own micro-fulfillment centers with full-time employees, whereas other companies connect customers, drivers, and retailers on a platform.Since its inception nine years ago,Gopuff has raised more than $3.5 billion and it was last valued at $15 billion in 2021. GoPuff delivers daily essentials and groceries in minutes across over 500 U.S. cities. The startup currently operates more than 250 micro-fulfillment centers servicing over 650 U.S. cities, in addition to the recently acquired BevMo! locations.According to Gopuff, 30% of Americans are within one mile and a half of a Gopuff fulfillment center. According to research firm YipitData, Gopuff currently has more than 70% share of the U.S. instant-commerce category. With millions of dollars in the war chest, Gopuff is now leading the crowded field against the likes of Instacart, Doordash, and Amazon Fresh. We also covered Gopuff back in January when the SoftBank-backed delivery tech startupexpanded into the private label businesswith the launch of itsown line of private label products. Gopuff kickedoff with bottled water under the “Basically” brand, followed by other household items like cleaning products, batteries, paper products, and food storage."

Three people familiar with the ongoing talks told Reuters that Freshippo is working with an adviser and a select list of potential financial investors that will be invited to join the funding round. The startup decided to cut its valuation expectations after China’s zero COVID-19 policy, especially covid restrictionsin Shanghai, badly impacted its operations. The sources, who declined to be identified as the information was confidential, also Reuters that the funding discussions are still in the final stages and the financial terms could change, two of the people cautioned, and a separate fourth source with knowledge of the matter.

The vast majority of its stores are located in first- and second-tier cities in China. Two sources also toldReuters that investors are also skeptical about whether the money-losing Freshippo can continue to grow its operations and turn a profit anytime soon, especially given the company’s bleak outlook as China’s economy continues its zero covid policy. The fourth source also said Freshippohad a healthy cash flow and was under no immediate pressure to raise fresh funds but added that the companywould welcome good investors to help it grow. Meanwhile, Freshippo is one of the many startups facing down round valuations.

2022.7.12,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/12/crypto-hedge-fund-went-10-billion-zero-just-3-months-founders-went-missing/,"BlockFi, Celsius Network, and Voyager Digital are just a few of the companieswith exposure to now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Now, Three Arrows is about to drag down othercompanies and crypto investorswith it. As recently as March of this year, 3AC managed about $10 billion in assets, making it one of the largest crypto hedge funds in the world. Two weeks ago, the troubled Three Arrows Capital was ordered into liquidation by a court in the British Virgin Islands. The firm was also told to sell all its assets and holdings in crypto startups. The liquidation makes Three Arrows one of the biggest casualties of the latest so-called “crypto winter.” As we reported last month, Three Arrows Capital surprised many in the crypto industryafter the firm announced it was unable to meet margin call demands from lenders, causing the leading crypto hedge fund into a crisis that comes as turmoil and credit crunch grip the crypto market.Three Arrows is one of the biggest and most active players in the crypto industry with investments spanning the lending and trading platforms. Another casualty of Three Arrows is crypto exchange startup Blockchain.com, which reportedly faces a $270 million hit on loans to 3AC. On the other hand, digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after Three Arrows couldn’t pay back about $670 million it had borrowed. The carnage didn’t stop there. U.S.-based crypto lenders Genesis and crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and crypto exchange FTX are also hit with losses. “Credit is being destroyed and withdrawn, underwriting standards are being tightened, solvency is being tested, so everyone is withdrawing liquidity from crypto lenders,” said Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, which focuses on blockchain investments. Meanwhile,lawyers representing Three Arrows’ creditors say the firm’s founders Zhu Su and Kyle Davies have gone missing and theirphysical whereabouts are “currently unknown.”In a filing last week, the lawyers allegedthat Three Arrows founders have not yet begun to cooperate with the liquidation process “in any meaningful manner.” According to Teneo’s Russell Crumpler, the attorney tasked with helping to facilitate the bankruptcy process, they werelast in contact with the two founders on a Zoom call last week. During the call,Zhu Su and Kyle Davies did not communicate with liquidators and kept their video and microphones turned off. As a result, Teneo deemed that the two had not provided “meaningful cooperation” throughout the liquidation process. Meanwhile, Three Arrows’ margin call has already rippled through the entire crypto market. One of the affected crypto companies is crypto lender BlockFi, which recently announcedthat it has liquidated its position in Three Arrows. Just like falling dominos, the fall of Three Arrows Capital can be traced to the collapse of stablecoin terraUSD (UST), and its sister token luna. 3AC told the Wall Street Journal it had invested $200 million in luna. But other industry observers said that Three Arrows’ exposure could be far greater. Some reports suggested that the firm’s exposure was around $560 million. Teneo also said in a sworn statement that there is a “real risk” that 3AC’s assets would disappear, “absent immediate authority to pursue discovery.” “That risk is heightened because a substantial portion of the Debtor’s assets are comprised of cash and digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens, that are readily transferrable,” Crumpler said in his statement. Founded in 2012 by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies,Three Arrows Capital is a hedge fund manager that provides risk-adjusted returns. The firm is headquartered in Singapore."

A combination of new technological advancements like artificial intelligence,quantum computing, and robotics, is delivering thatwere once thought impossible. Last September, XPeng Robotics, a robotics arm of the Chinese EV maker XPeng, became the first company to bring unicorns to reality with itsAI-powered robotic unicorn called the Little White Dragon. Thefour-legged robotic ‘pet’ is aimed at children and it’s equipped with state-of-the-art motion control, navigation, and AI-powered “emotional interaction” capabilities. XPeng Robotics said the new unicorn robot will one day help the company to developflying cars and self-driving vehicles. The announcement of the new robot also caught the attention of tech investors looking for the next big thing.Fast forward about a year later,XPeng Robotics now aims to bring smart robots to households in the next two years. Today,XPeng Robotics announced it has raised $100 million in Series A funding,the largest single-tranche fundraising for the bionic robot sector in China in the past two years.The round wasled by VC heavyweights and high-profile venture capital firm IDG Capital, with XPeng also participating. XPeng Robotics said in a press release that it would use the new capital infusion to strengthen its research and development investment in robotic hardware and software, recruit talent, accelerate product development and boost technology and product competitiveness. “Development of the robotics sector is propelled by breakneck progress in science and technology. XPENG Robotics is committed to establishing a holistic ecosystem for intelligent robots. The completion of our Series A fundraising reflects the capital market’s expectations and is a vote of confidence in the prospects for this sector. It also represents the full recognition of our strength in R&D as well as our capability for future commercialization,” said Mr. Xu Zhigen, CEO of XPENG Robotics. The Series A financing enables XPENG Robotics to further strengthen its full-stack R&D investment in robotic hardware and software, top-tier talent acquisition, and accelerating product development and iteration, to boost its technology and product competitiveness.

The announcement comes almost three months afterKlarna laid off 10% of its workforce as the economic downturn hits buy now, pay later space. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said that the“vast majority” of Klarna employees won’t be affected by the measures. However some “will be informed that we cannot offer you a role in the new organization.” The round was backed byexisting investors Sequoia and Silver Lake, with additional investment from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company in the round.Klarna said it will use the funding proceeds to continue its US expansion. Siemiatkowski tried to downplay the significance of the company’s valuation decline. He insisted the deal was a “testament to the strength of Klarna’s business.” “During the steepest drop in global stock markets in over fifty years, investors recognized our strong position and continued progress in revolutionizing the retail banking industry,” Siemiatkowski said in a statement Monday. Klarna was founded in 2005 in Stockholm, Sweden with the aim of making it easier for people to shop online. In the last 12 years, technology has evolved, excited, and transformed the world around us, yet its mission remains as relevant as ever, to make paying as simple, safe, and above all, smooth as possible. Klarna’s app has more than 12 million monthly active users worldwide, with 55,000 daily downloads, significantly outpacing its nearest competitor with almost 4x as many downloads over the last year.Klarna, aunicorn startup, is one of the world’s largest providers of “buy now, pay later” services, which offer shoppers interest-free financing over a period of installments.The company said it now has almost 30 million U.S. users in total. Early this year,Klarna also launched a new credit card in the UKto take on banks and credit card firms. Unlike regular credit cards,Klarna said the card will allow for payment on purchases to be delayed for up to 30 days, with no interest charged on the balance or fees levied for late paymentwhen used at high street shops. The new credit card is offered to customers in additionto Klarna’s buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) products for UK customers. The “Buy now, pay later” giant also confirmed it had built up a waitlist of 400,000 consumers in the UK, which it claimed showed “strong demand for a new approach to credit,” following a successful launch in Germany and Sweden. Over time, Klarna said itplans to add more of its payment options, including splitting purchases into three monthly payments."
2022.7.13,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/13/integrated-graphene-to-invest-9-5m-to-enable-disruptive-manufacturing-using-the-worlds-first-market-ready-graphene/,"Graphene is the thinnest material known to man. At just one atom thick, graphene is incredibly strong, about 200 times stronger than steel. Graphene has the potential to change the world, witha lot of promise in almost any industry. Its applications can be found in anti-corrosion coatings and paints, efficient and precise sensors, faster and efficient electronics, flexible displays, efficient solar panels, faster DNA sequencing, drug delivery, and more. On the other hand, graphene foam is a more diverse form of graphene, a solid, open-cell foam made of single-layer sheets of graphene. Graphenefoamis strong and conductive and has a large and electrochemically active surface area and a porous structure which makes it a candidate substrate for the electrode of lithium-ion batteries. In addition, a 3D graphene foamis useful for many applications including sensors, purification, and other absorption materials. One company that is pushing the boundaries in the 3D graphene form space isIntegrated Graphene, a Scotland-based tech startup that isproducing the world’s highest quality pure 3D Graphene Foam called Gii using arevolutionary design for the manufacturing process. Today, Integrated Graphene announced plans to invest up to $9.5 million (£8 million) to scale upits revolutionary 3D Graphene foam, Gii®, manufacturing process to meet surging global demand from the human diagnostics and energy markets. Founded in 2016, Integrated Graphene has developed the world’s only commercially viable graphene manufacturing process that is currently scaled to high volumes. This novel process eliminates the scale-up challenges associated with CVD graphene and graphene powder. As well as direct manufacturing, Integrated Graphene is designing manufacturing processes for blue-chip companies to effectively bolt-on to existing lines, and it also has a team dedicated to supporting organisations to adapt graphene technologies for their products. The company’s investment plan will focus on scaling-up the manufacturing of its market-ready graphene enhanced electrodes and super capacitors which are currently being piloted by global blue-chips in human diagnostics point of care testing and smart label asset tracking applications. These printable electronic products include the Gii-Sens®, which offers a better and more-effective sensor material for the human diagnostics market and Gii-Cap® which targets 10% of $500 billion battery market, with the potential to remove 60 million batteries from being thrown away every year. Since coming out of “stealth mode” in 2020, Integrated Graphene has quickly established its reputation in the market, winning several commercial contracts and dramatically increasing its intellectual property portfolio. As part of its growth plans, the company intends to double its existing footprint in Stirling and treble its headcount to 100 over the next three years, hiring a significant number of market leading development and commercial experts in the UK, Europe and North America. The company will also increase capital expenditure in its next generation pilot line to allow rapid market expansion of Gii-Sens and Gii-Cap. For Gii-Sens, that includes wearables, animal diagnostics, companion diagnostics, environmental diagnostics. With Gii-Cap, expansion markets include Drones, e-mobility, space, satellites, and wearables. The investment comes on the back of a significantly oversubscribed Series A + funding round for an undisclosed sum led by existing investors, Par Equity and Archangels. Following graphene’s discovery in 2004, it has been hailed as a wonder material for its potential across a number of industries and applications, from quantum computing to healthcare. Most products under development continue to use a powder version of graphene, which is notoriously difficult to scale and, in most cases, performance is shy of expectations hence commercial adoption being slow. Integrated Graphene has developed a unique breakthrough process to produce a pure 3D Graphene Foam (Gii®) onto a range of substances at ambient room temperature. The company believes that its revolutionary Gii®manufacturing process addresses the key requirements of the graphene industry of producing high quality, cost effective and production scale graphene, which has not been achieved by any company to date. The addressable market for graphene enabled products is potentially more than $25 billion based on reasonable levels of penetration across all markets, and volume demand for graphene across key application markets is thought to have the potential to reach $1 trillion by 2030[1]. Claus Marquordt, co-founder and CEO, Integrated Graphene said: “This investment marks a real tipping point for Integrated Graphene and the manufacturing of our unique 3D Graphene foam in its first two market-ready products. We are actively involved in projects with several global blue-chip companies to deliver high volumes of electrodes and super capacitors that address critical needs in accelerating point of care human diagnostics for a wide range of killer diseases and in enabling low-cost flexible and sustainable power systems for the booming IoT, Smart Label and Wearable tech markets. By investing now, we will be ready, this year, to produce millions of units per annum from a new facility in Stirling and to transfer the technology at scale to global partners in the future.” Aidan MacMillan, Senior Investment Manager at Par Equity, said: “Integrated Graphene has developed a game changing, frontier solution with the potential to drive enormous impact across a range of large-scale industries. As existing investors in the business, Par Equity, and a selection of our advisers, have worked closely with Claus and the team to build the business. We’re delighted to continue our support in this round, to catalyse the team’s ambition and unlock the company’s growth potential.” Niki Mckenzie, Joint Managing Director at Archangels, added: “Since we first invested in Integrated Graphene two years ago, the company has moved rapidly from start-up to scale-up and now has its sights focused on meeting increased global demand from multiple sectors. We are looking forward to continuing our relationship with the team, as they embark on this next critical phase of growth.”"

The announcement causedthe company to lose $50 billion in just one day. During the earnings call in April, Netflix reported a loss of 200,000 subscribers during the first quarter causing the stock to plunge by more than 25% during the market trading session. Subscriber loss is just one of many problems Netflix is facing. Once the model for other streaming companies, Netflix now faces stiff competition from rivals including Amazon, Disney, Discovery, HBO, Hulu, Apple TV+, and other networks now offering subscription-based “Plus” services. As part of its effortto stem the tide of viewers who are opting to unsubscribe from its service, Netflix announced back in April that it wouldintroduce a new lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan for consumers, in addition to its existing ads-free basic, standard, and premium plans. In keeping with that plan, Netflix announced today it has selected Microsoft as its global advertising technology and sales partner. In a joint announcement by the two companies on Wednesday, Netflix said it has partnered with Microsoft to offer an ad-supported service. In a statement,Netflix COO Greg Peters said: “Microsoft has the proven ability to support all our needs as we together build a new ad supported offering. More importantly, Microsoft offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members” Mikhail Parakhin, President of Web Experiences, Microsoft also added: “We’re thrilled to be named Netflix’s technology and sales partner to help power their first ad-supported subscription offering.At launch, consumers will have more options to access Netflix’s award-winning content. Marketers looking to Microsoft for their advertising needs will have access to the Netflix audience and premium connected TV inventory. All ads served on Netflix will be exclusively available through the Microsoft platform. Today’s announcement also endorses Microsoft’s approach to privacy, which is built on protecting customers’ information.” Desperate Time Calls For Desperate Measures For some years now, Netflix Co-CEO Reed Hastings has been opposed to adding commercials or other promotions to the streaming platform. However, during the company’s prerecorded earnings conference call, Hastings appears to change his tune. He now says that it “makes a lot of sense” to offer customers a cheaper option. Meanwhile, Netflix has over 70 percent of its value from a record-high back in early January. Netflix has lost all its pandemic gain. Its stock is now trading at $176.56."

Immediately after the announcement, Heardle’s website redirects users to a new Spotify page. However, Spotify said that the acquisition will not affectexisting Heardle players and it will continue to remain free for players. “The look and feel of the game will stay the same, and it’ll remain free to play for everyone. And effective today, players can listen to the full song on Spotify at the end of the game,” Spotify said in a statement. Founded a year ago, Heardle is a simple but endlessly challenging game. Players are tasked with guessing a song based on its opening notes. They get six guesses, with each hint giving a few more seconds of music to inform their next answer. Ultimately, they get a chance to discover the song in its entirety, whether or not they guessed it correctly.  “We are always looking for innovative and playful ways to enhance music discovery and help artists reach new fans,” commented Jeremy Erlich, Global Head of Music, Spotify. “Heardle has proven to be a really fun way to connect millions of fans with songs they know and love and with new songs . . . and a way to compete with their friends as to who has the best musical knowledge. Since its debut, the game has quickly built a loyal following, and it aligns with our plans to deepen interactivity across the Spotify ecosystem.” Meanwhile, Spotify said Heardle will be available to millions of its customers starting with users in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. “And soon, hundreds of millions more people around the world will have the opportunity to play and enjoy the game in their native language,” Spotify said. Just last month,Spotify said it expects to reach $100 billion in annual revenue in 10 years, nearly 10-fold from its current revenue of $11.4 billion.Since its inception about two decades ago, the music streaming behemoth has seen explosive growth in revenue and a customer base of over 400 million monthly active users, including over 160 million premium subscribers."

You have the right to an attorney.” It now appears that a team of Twitter lawyers may be using the same in a lawsuit again Tesla CEO Elon Musk over the failed $44 billion buyout deal. Last Friday,Elon Musk said he was backing out of the deal to buy Twitter for $4 billion over fake accounts and spam bots. In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Elon Musk said he’s seeking to end the $44 billion deal, citing a lack of sufficient information on fake accounts and spam bots. Immediately after the announcement, Twitter filed a lawsuit against Musk for failure to consummate the $44 billion deal. Twitter’s chairman, Bret Taylor, also vowed that the social giant is pursuing legal action against Tesla CEO Elon Musk over the botched $44 billion takeover deal. In a post, Taylor wrote: “The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk…” Then on Monday morning, Musk responded to the lawsuit early with a laughing meme below. The meme has a series of four photos of the Telsa founder laughing with captions that read: “They said I couldn’t buy Twitter; Then they wouldn’t disclose bot info; Now they want to force me to buy Twitter in court; Now they have to disclose bot info in court.” But now, the tweet, along with other tweets of Chuck Norris playing chess, may cost Elon Musk $44 billion. pic.twitter.com/JcLMee61wj — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 11, 2022  According to a court filing, Twitter attorneys accused Musk of making light of the deal.

The numbers are not looking good. In fact, it’s getting worse.According to the report, US inflation jumps by 0.5 percent from May to hit 9.1% in June, the largest 12-month increase since November 1981. As CNBC noted, the consumer price index (CPI) increased 9.1% from a year ago in June, above the 8.8% Dow Jones estimate. The current inflation number also does not take into the cost of food,gasoline, groceries, rent, and dental care. The bad news did not end there.Workers’ hourly wages fell 1% during the month and are down 3.6% from a year ago when adjusted for inflation. Inflation rose 9.1% in June, even more than expected, as price pressures intensify https://t.co/aQ1PskuTba — CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) July 13, 2022  The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shared: “The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 1.3 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis after rising 1.0 percent in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 9.1 percent before seasonal adjustment. The increase was broad-based, with the indexes for gasoline, shelter, and food being the largest contributors. The energy index rose 7.5 percent over the month and contributed nearly half of the all items increase, with the gasoline index rising 11.2 percent and the other major component indexes also rising. The food index rose 1.0 percent in June, as did the food at home index.” The ripple effect of inflation is everywhere including in the tech sector.So far, at least 50 tech companies have either laid off their employees or plan to do so in the near future.

As theripple effect of the war spread around the world, the impact of the war is even more felt in technology companies. A month after the war began, we shared the story about how the war affected one EU tech startup and how tech startups are coping with the aftermath of the war. Although the war has slowed down funding activities in Europe, the good news is that the war has fueled the determination and ingenuity of Ukrainian startups as they move their operations to other European countries to continue their operations. One of these startups isPreply, a Ukrainian-founded tech startup that provides an online language learning marketplace. Despite the war in Ukraine, Preply founders Kirill Bigai, Dmytro Voloshyn, and Serge Lukyanov have succeeded in building a truly global business, expanding the team to over 400 employees of 58 different nationalities across 30 countries worldwide. Today,Preply announced it has raised $50 million in Series C fundingled by Silicon Valley-based Owl Ventures, the largest Education Technology investor in the world. Existing investors Diligent Capital, Hoxton Ventures, Educapital, Evli Growth Partners, Przemyslaw Gacek, co-founder of Grupa Pracuj also participated, as well as new investors such as Swisscom Ventures, and Orbit Capital.The latest funding bringsPreply’s total funding to over $100 million since its inception. The Preply marketplace pairs hundreds of thousands of learners with more than 32,000 tutors teaching over 50 languages. Over the past year, Preply has tripled the size of its B2B language learning business which now counts Bytedance (Tiktok), Mercedes, and McKinsey, among others. On the consumer side, the number of people using the Preply app has grown 4x over the last two years, and in many geographies overall users have almost doubled year on year. The number of students being taught on the platform now exceeds the number of students taught in Ivy League universities as the platform plans to conquer the growing online language learning market, set to reach $47 billion by 2025. Kirill Bigai, Co-founder and CEO of Preply, said, “I am indescribably proud of what the Preply team has achieved. We have become the world’s leading brand in live language classes and the platform of choice for so many tutors who have decided to teach online. With the additional funding, we plan to continue growing our footprint in the US and Europe by doubling down on AI-based matching and delivering on our promise to connect the largest live language learning community in the world.” Founded in 2012 by the Ukrainian team of Kirill Bigai, Serge Lukyanov, and Dmytro Voloshyn,Preply now has over 400 employees of 58 different nationalities. Preply is a US company with employees based in 30 countries across Europe, the US, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Preply also connects more than 32,000 tutors teaching 50 languages to hundreds of thousands of learners in 180 countries worldwide. With student-tutor matches being suggested through a machine-learning algorithm, recommended tutors create customized lesson plans to suit the learner’s budget, schedule, and current knowledge. Ross Darwin, Principal at Owl Ventures added, “We’re thrilled to partner with Preply on their next phase of growth. We’re particularly excited by the continued momentum of the consumer business as well as its new language learning offering for companies, increasingly reliant on international workforces.” Though Preply’s main offices are in the U.S. & Europe, the founders hail from Kyiv. Over the last few months, the company’s global workforce has launched a number of meaningful initiatives to support Ukraine. This includes a ‘Messages to Ukraine’ campaign, translating over 8000 global messages of support into Ukrainian, as well as a free language assistance program for 1000 Ukrainians crossing borders and grappling with a new language. The UK is Preply’s biggest market in Europe and the country of birth of an important share of English language tutors, which is the most studied subject on Preply. The company also said that 23% of its UK learners are studying English, followed by Spanish (18%), French (10%), Arabic, and Italian. According to research,English is among the top languages studied in the U.K. due to relocators, expats, and foreign students living in-country.The top 3 reasons British learners are using the platform are to improve their conversation skills (41%), for professional reasons (19%), and for their children (11%) Within Preply’s global community of tutors, the U.K. is the second most represented country of birth. While many tutors were born in the U.K., 46% of those are now earning their Preply living teaching from a different country, with Spain, Thailand, Italy, France, and South Africa being popular places of residence.160 countries are currently studying with a British tutor on Preply.One English language tutor from the U.K. taught 602 different students on Preply in 2021."

Founded in 2019, Airlift started out as a mass transit startup but had to halt its operations in March due to Covid-19. In 2020, the startup decided to diversify into last-mile delivery with the launch of a 30-minute grocery delivery platform calledAirlift Express. Through the platform, Airlift delivers essentials to households in 30 minutes across Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, and other areas, according to the company’s statement onLinkedIn."

Companies want their content to be easily distributed over different communication channels: websites, web and mobile applications, and connected objects. Traditional content management systems (CMS) that were introduced 20 years ago have a monolithic legacy architecture that is difficult to maintain, often slow, and vulnerable to hackers while most modern CMS lack flexibility and the ability to be customized. This is the problemheadless CMS solves by making content management easy, fast, and secure for everyone.It’s called “headless” because the front end is not part of the CMS. Now, Austria-based tech startup Storyblok wants to take headless technology mainstream and increase its adoption with the launching of a new fund. Today,Storyblok announced the launch of a €1.5M Partner Fund to take the headless technology mainstream.As part of the fund, hundreds of Storyblok’s partners will each receive a €5K co-marketing budget to showcase the best content experiences they have created on headless tech for their clients. This new fund will also enable Storyblok to support the growth and success of its agency partners and develop co-marketing activities that evangelize a best-of-breed, headless architecture as the foundation to allow agencies to create and scale better content experiences for their clients. In addition to the Partner Fund, Storyblok Certified Partners receive benefits such as free development spaces with Storyblok’s CMS, revenue share, the ability to build custom apps, a dedicated success team, and much more. The money will be distributed to partners through multiple initiatives, including a €5K budget that every Storyblok Certified Partner can use to highlight its collaboration with Storyblok in any way they want: events, guerilla marketing, content development, ad campaigns, etc. From now until September 10th, Storyblok is running a contest for Certified Partners to submit their most creative co-marketing ideas for the chance to double their dedicated budget to €10K. “Partners played an important role in the growth of Storyblok during the past couple of years,” said Barry D’Arcy, VP of Partners at Storyblok. “We appreciate the steps they took to help us get where we are today, and so we as a partner team and Storyblok as a whole would like to pay those good deeds forward to all of our partners, both old and new. The Partner Fund is one example of how we want to support our partners’ growth and boost their businesses with Storyblok. We all have stories to tell—let’s do it together.” “We’ve seen so many great marketing initiatives around Storyblok that allowed our partners to grow,” said Thomas Peham, VP of Marketing at Storyblok. “With the €1.5M Partner Fund, we not only want to help our partners with a dedicated marketing budget but also team up with them to tell more stories at scale while shaping the future of digital storytelling together.” Founded in 2017Alexander Feiglstorfer and Dominik Angerer, Storyblok is used by more than80,000 developers and marketers to deliver content experiences on any front end including websites, eCommerce, mobile apps, AR/VR, or voice content."

But the US is not alone. Europe is also experiencing carbon emissions from millions of vehicles on its roads. To address this problem,thousands of European riders are now ditching carsfor e-bikes and scootersas we enter the summer months. Today,Dott,an Amsterdam-based scooter startup, announced it has seen a rapid rise in the use of its e-scooters and e-bikes across Europe as its peak summer season starts. Total rides increased by 73% in Q2 2022 compared to the first quarter, up by 192% year on year. The growing rides were fuelled by sharp growth in new riders, with Dott more than doubling (116%) the number of new riders to its service between April-June compared to the first three months of the year. The new users are taking advantage of efficient travel which allows them to unlock the benefits of their city. The most popular reasons given by new riders for trying the service are to save time (58%), being fun to ride (53%), and being easy to use and readily available (52%).1 With over 50,000 vehicles in total across major European cities, Dott’s new e-bikes, first launched at the end of 2021, are gaining popularity alongside its e-scooters. Since the start of the year, rides on Dott’s e-bikes have increased by 180%.2 Henri Moissinac, Co-Founder and CEO, Dott, said: “The summer season provides a great opportunity for more people to try our shared e-scooter and e-bike services for the first time. Our riders are quick to realize that our vehicles can transform their travel experience, using our service for efficient, fun, and reliable travel on a more regular basis.” Throughout 2022, Dott has expanded into more new markets. The cities of Stockholm and Tel Aviv have both seen significant growth in use since their launch. And most recently, exclusive tender wins for both e-scooters and e-bikes in Grenoble will provide residents and visitors with sustainable travel across the city. The environment and social impact are at the heart of every business decision at Dott. The micro-mobility company is working to reuse, upcycle or recycle 100% of used vehicles and parts, and aims to exceed a five-year life-span for its vehicles. Dott is targeting a 100% electric logistics fleet and renewable energy in all its cities. The service is designed to be as accessible as possible, and Dott works closely with local communities, aiming for equal coverage across the areas it serves and partnering with local organizations to help improve the cities in which it operates. In 2018, the year it was founded, Dottraised €20 million ($23 million) from media firm Naspers, European venture capital firm EQT Ventures, and a number of other backers, including Axel Springer. In 2019, Dott ran a pilot program with 100 scooters in the French capital’s startup hub Station F. We covered Dott last year afterthe company launched its brand new e-bikes, with the first vehicles now available on the streets of Paris. By the end of the year, Dott says 3,000 e-bikes will be in operation in the city and several thousand across Europe, providing a new way to get around and making it easier for more people to choose through one single app the type of environmentally friendly travel that’s best for them."

His week started out with a lawsuit from Twitter asking the billionaire to consummate the $44 billion merger agreement. Then yesterday, longtime Tesla Autopilot Executive Andrej Karpathy announced on Twitter he was leaving the company. Karpathy’s announcement came just two weeks afterTesla laid off hundreds of autopilot employees and closed its San Mateo, California office.Before the layoff, the autopilot teams at the San Mateo office were tasked with assessing customer vehicle data related to the Autopilot driver-assistance features and performing so-called data labeling. In a post,Karpathy saidthat he’s no longer working for the electric vehicle maker.“It’s been a great pleasure to help Tesla towards its goals over the last 5 years and a difficult decision to part ways,” Karpathy wrote on Twitter.

Fast forward five months later,Millicent announced today it has successfully performed the world’s first test of a Full-Reserve Digital Currency (FRDC) aimed at the retail market.The test was designed as a technology demonstration for Innovate UK, a branch of UK Research and Innovation, the national funding agency investing in advanced scientific and technological research that has co-funded Millicent’s project. Performed within a sandboxed environment, the demonstration simulated fiat on-ramping via Faster Payments from one of the UK’s largest consumer banks, as well as the on-chain conversion and minting of FRDC tokens pegged to the British Pound Sterling, and a variety of payment and settlement scenarios. Designed for consumer safety and confidence, Millicent’s FRDC is privately-issued digital currencies pegged to a traditional fiat currency and 100% collateralized by liquid ‘cash’ deposits, in a ringfenced account safeguarded by a regulated third party, directly at the central bank.  The success of the demonstration is a key milestone in Millicent’s mission to build a financial infrastructure that combines the benefits of distributed ledgers and smart contracts with legacy economic infrastructure. Millicent is a firm believer in the potential of blockchain to create a more accessible and equitable financial system for all. “[Millicent] addresses the major shortcomings of the payments industry, both traditional and crypto.” said assessors from Innovate UK, adding “Delivering a digital wallet and payment application accessible via iOS/Android apps, with an API for integration with existing web/mobile platforms within this project is courageous and ambitious.” Millicent’s first-ever test of a retail FRDC demonstrated various use cases, including micropayments such as a £0.15 to access a paywalled newspaper article, the use of a QR code to tip a busker £1, as well as higher-value peer-to-peer payments. This test showcased the low fees and near-instant settlement of Millicent’s FRDC network, as well as its flexibility, with the demonstrations of payments via mobile app, custodial wallet, and non-custodial wallet. Although Millicent’s test could be viewed as meeting the definition for the world’s first retail test of a synthetic Central Bank Digital Currency (sCBDC), the company prefers the term Full-Reserve Digital Currency to differentiate its offering from central bank-issued digital currencies, as well as other types of ‘stablecoins’ that have proven to be anything but stable—despite nomenclature convincing the public otherwise. Stablecoins have, in recent months, come under close scrutiny due to their sometimes risky designs and a lack of transparency, resulting in slow mainstream adoption and significant losses to consumers. At the same time, some members of the public remain wary of CBDCs due to concerns around potential overreach and the erosion of privacy. FRDC is designed to address these concerns as the UK quickly moves to embrace regulated digital payments. As privately issued digital currency, it offers a level of disintermediation between the public sector and end users, while its assets are backed by 100% full (not fractional) liquid reserves. While other players are working to develop wholesale sCBDCs for settlements between financial institutions, Millicent’s FRDCs are focused on delivering the savings and benefits of digital currencies to everyday people and small to medium-sized businesses in a safe and user-friendly manner. “We are extremely proud to have presented this world-first solution to Innovate UK—especially during such a turbulent time for the crypto markets. Recent troubles with popular cryptocurrency platforms highlight the importance of projects like Millicent, that focus on safety, stability, and real-world benefits,” said Millicent’s CEO, Stella Dyer. Moreover, Millicent’s network is based on a public-permissioned infrastructure with democratic community governance, ensuring that everyday users can take a seat at the table of macroeconomics. In every sense, it’s a system that’s designed for the mass adoption of everyday digital finance. Financial inclusion is a key motivator for Millicent co-founder and CEO Stella Dyer. She arrived in the U.K. as a child war refugee and went from living in public housing to Harvard Business School before gaining experience at banks including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, where she managed the Global High-tech Investment Banking Division. A keen philanthropist, Ms. Dyer is working to create an accessible and equitable financial system that benefits everybody in an effort to unlock latent prosperity across the world. Co-funded by the UK Government’s innovation agency, Millicent is a hybrid blockchain tech startup that’s building the infrastructure for the future of global finance.The company is led by Harvard Business School alum and founder of Millicent, Stella Dyer, who said the company is on track to provide digital financial services to over 1.7 billion people across the globe. The company will combine the perks of the legacy financial system with blockchain technology to transform and revolutionize finance, especially for the unbanked and underbanked people. Money is evolving, and Millicent is building the financial foundation for the future: a universal digital finance network for all realities, both on and offline. Built with next-generation technology, Millicent combines the benefits of distributed ledgers and smart contracts with legacy economic infrastructure. Millicent’s fast, secure, and environmentally-friendly network makes sending, spending and saving money instant, borderless, and accessible to all."

Robinhoodalsorestricted thousands of retail investors from trading Dogecoin. Thenotorious fintech startup has since lost over 75% of its value since going public in July 2021. Sensing an opportunity, one UK fintech startup ishoping to become Europe’s answer to Robinhood but without all the negatives. EnterLightyear, a London-based fintech startup that promises retail investors commission-free trading on European and US stocks. This week, the startup officially extends its global footprint and expands its presence across Europe. The expansion will land Lightyear in 19 new markets, including 19 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. To support the expansion, Lightyear announced it has raised $25 million in a Series A round of funding led by Lightspeed, a U.S. venture capital firm, with participation from other high-profile backers including additional backing from British billionaire and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. Founded in 2021 by Estonian entrepreneurs Martin Sokk and Mihkel Aamer,Lightyear touts a “simple and approachable way to invest your money globally without unnecessary barriers and fees” as itsunique selling proposition.

But, our goal remains the same: to give all of Europe access to the world’s markets without hidden fees and to make investing easy for everyone. We’re so excited to welcome Nicole and Lightspeed, alongside the Virgin Group, onto our strong bench of investors that share this vision with us and have such deep experience in growing successful businesses from the very start of their journey.” The one-year-old fintech startup currently offers commission-free trading in over 3,000 global stocks and multi-currency accounts. The two co-founders previously worked at Wise, the U.K.-listed money transfer firmbefore founding Lightyear. Commenting on the funding,Sir Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group, said: “For too long, financial markets have been overly complex with high barriers to entry and confusing jargon. Martin, Mihkel and the Lightyear team are lifting the lid on the world of investing – making it more transparent whilst empowering people through education – to choose the products which are right for them.”"
2022.7.15,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/15/clean-energy-tech-startup-monolith-raises-300m-funding-cut-dependency-fossil-fuels-using-clean-hydrogen/,"The impacts of climate change are global in scope, unprecedented in scale, and can no longer be denied. According to multiple studies,the burning of fossil fuels accounts for about75% of global greenhouse gas emissions,which is the largest driver of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels is the primary cause of climate change, producing large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) when burned andaltering the Earth’s ecosystems and causing human and environmental health.Surprisingly,over 80% of global energy still comes from fossil fuels despite trillion dollars of investments in renewable energy. Now, one tech startup is on a mission to reverse the trend and decarbonized the planet with its clean hydrogen technology. Monolith is a Nebraska-basedclean energy startup using a carbon-free technologyto convert natural gas into two components by creating nearly zero local emissions and significantly reduced life-cycle emissions overall.Through its methane pyrolysis technology, Monolith is able to prevent an estimated 2.3 tons of CO2 from being released for every ton of carbon black produced compared to traditional manufacturing processes.Monolith technology now produces hydrogen to power electricity, heat, and cars as well as carbon black for tire products. By splitting methane, “you’ve just created hydrogen without creating any CO2,” Monolith co-founder and CEO Rob Hanson said, explaining that solidifying the carbon keeps it from entering the atmosphere.“If you do it just right you get the carbon out in a form called carbon black.” The success ofMonolith has spread far and wide and also attracted interest from investors and the US government. Late last year,Monolith received a $1.04 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to allow the10-year-old company to expand its clean hydrogen and carbon black production facilities in Hallam, Nebraska, U.S.A. Today,Monolith announced it has raisedmore than $300 million in new investment ledby TPG Rise Climate, the dedicated climate investing strategy of TPG’s global impact investing platform TPG Rise, with Decarbonization Partners, a partnership between BlackRock and Temasek, as co-lead. “Global decarbonization by 2050 will require bold steps and transformational partnerships, which we believe we’ve found in working with TPG Rise Climate and Decarbonization Partners,” said Rob Hanson, co-founder and CEO, of Monolith. “We’re eager to continue Monolith’s growth trajectory to support a high energy, low emissions future.” Monolith Rob Hanson, co-founder and CEO, was born and raised in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. (Source: LinkedIn) Monolith cleanly produces essential materials including hydrogen and carbon black by utilizing an innovative and proprietary breakthrough in commercial-scale methane pyrolysis, and was the first U.S. manufacturer to produce clean hydrogen using methane pyrolysis at scale. This innovation attracted worldwide attention, prompting companies like SK to sign a memorandum of understanding last October with Monolith to produce clean hydrogen and carbon black in South Korea. It also generated a collaboration agreement and letter of intent with The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company late in 2021. Monolith said it will use the new cash infusion tofurther technological development that will offer next-generation product capabilities and other corporate-level expansion. It will also enable Monolith’s continued development of a deep backlog of clean hydrogen, ammonia, and carbon projects with industry-leading partners. “Our investment in Monolith reflects TPG Rise Climate’s pursuit of companies developing clean molecules and materials, providing sustainable, cost-competitive alternatives to carbon and hydrogen-based products,” said Jonathan Garfinkel, Partner at TPG and senior member of its climate investing team. “Following a decade of research and development, Monolith has developed expansive intellectual property, deployed the methane pyrolysis process in innovative ways, and established itself as a unique solution for an industry that is otherwise incredibly emissions intensive. We look forward to partnering with Monolith to further develop and scale its technology.” “Producing sustainable hydrogen and carbon black is crucial to decarbonizing the energy and materials industry. We are pleased to support Monolith’s growth and continued expansion,” said Dr. Meghan Sharp, Global Head of Decarbonization Partners. “Monolith has established itself as a technology leader in methane pyrolysis, providing sustainable and low-cost hydrogen and carbon black from natural gas. We see significant opportunity for the company to continue scaling its technology, enabling the decarbonization of a broad range of important end markets.” The company has attracted the interest of numerous high-profile clean energy investors and recently received conditional approval for a more than $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy Loan Programs Office to expand its production facilities in Nebraska. The DOE loan has not yet closed and is subject to satisfaction of final conditions. Founded in 2012 and currently operates its first commercial-scale production facility in Hallam, Nebraska,Monolith is a next‐generation clean hydrogen and materials company that uses 100% carbon-free energy as part of a proprietary process to convert conventional and renewable natural gas to hydrogen and carbon black in an environmentally advantaged manner."

In December 2021,TikTok dethroned Google to become the most visited website in the world, ending Google’s 23 years of dominance. It was recently reported that 8 new users join TikTok every second, with an average of 650,000 new users joining on a daily basis. Now, Higher Visibility, an SEO firm that offers a full range of interactive marketing services, is now out with a new report about thefuture of TikTok growth. In the report, Higher Visibilityused predicted statistics and compared TikTok growth to population data for countries and continents worldwide to give a total predicted year-on-year growth figure to provide some extra context of just how significant the reach and influence of the app are now, and what could become of it in the future. TikTok data was based on a recent prediction of 8 new users per second. Country data is sourced from ourworldindata.com with annual deaths subtracted from births to give total growth. As of 2018, TikTok had already amassed a total of 271,188,301 users – surpassing the total populations of Spain, Italy, France, and the entirety of the UK combined in its first full year. As of 2019, TikTok users had almost doubled to 507,552,660. Meanwhile, the world’s population increased at a slower rate with a growth of just over 1% on the previous year. It was reported that TikTok celebrated a milestone of 1,000,000,000 users in 2021. As of this year, the platform had more users than the total population of Japan, the Philippines, Egypt, Vietnam, Turkey, Canada, Germany, Thailand, Spain, Italy, France, and the UK combined (977,106,058) after just 4 years in circulation.  Looking to the future, as of 2025 TikTok’s growth is predicted to reach 2,597,664,000 daily users. In comparison to the valuated 339,893,949 population of the United States as of 2025, the total number of users on the social media platform is set to surpass 41x the population of the UK (or 4x the population of Europe) in just three years’ time. The worldwide population in 2035 is approximated at 9,208,674,347. Shockingly, in the same year, total TikTok users could reach 5,334,816,000. With the population of Asia predicted to reach 5,279,827,286; TikTok’s growth could surpass the population of the most densely populated continent in the world. To really see how TikTok’s growth has the potential to progress in years to come, Higher Visibility took the study even further into the future and analyzed it every year from 2017 – 2050. The platform is predicted to reach an incredible 9,067,296,000 total users by 2050. To put this into context, that is equivalent to just over 90% of the entire world’s predicted population. Methodology: TikTok data was based on a recent prediction of 8 new users per second. Country data is sourced from ourworldindata.com with annual deaths subtracted from births to give total growth.

With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver.

Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol. Founded in 2020 byDavid Joao Vieira Carvaho, and Monica Oravcova,Naoris Protocol is the Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh for the hyper-connected world.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.7.16,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol. Founded in 2020 byDavid Joao Vieira Carvaho, and Monica Oravcova,Naoris Protocol is the Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh for the hyper-connected world.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.7.17,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

We were looking for a partner with a similar ethos that could execute at the scale and speed we needed. We found that in Humanity Health.”"
2022.7.18,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/18/snapchat-finally-rolls-web-version-popular-photo-messaging-app-decade-launch/,"Snapchat is finally coming to the web after more than ten years since the company debuted the mobile app.Snap, the parent of the popular photo and messaging app, said Monday that it’s rolling out “Snapchat for Web” toallow users to chat, snap, and video call from their computers. Snap saidthat the feature will be exclusive to Snapchat+ subscribers beginning July 18 and will start with subscribers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The company did not say when the global rollout will occur. “Every day 332 million people open Snapchat on their phones, and with our camera, can start conversations with their real friends. Today, we’re introducing Snapchat for Web, a new way for our community to stay connected through our camera when they’re at their computers,” Snap said in a post on its website. According to the company,the web version will be a more stripped-down version of the mobile app, primarily focusing on the app’s messaging feature as opposed to its Stories feature. Snapchat for Web will include features like chat reactions and chat reply, along with Lenses, which the company plans to roll out very soon. Just like the core Snap app, messages in the web version will disappear after 24 hours, and any Snaps users watch from their desktop computers will be deleted right after viewing.  In a major pivot to boost its revenue, which mostly depended on advertising, last month Snap launched Snapchat+, a paid version of the Snapchat app, in the United States priced at $3.99 a month, and in a few other markets. Tech companies, especially social media platforms, are under pressure as companies cut back on ad budgets in response to rising costs and weakening consumer spending. Two months ago, Snap said it would miss revenue and profit targets for the second quarter and would have to slow hiring and lower spending. Snap also claimed that more than 100 million Snapchatters use its voice and video calling each month on average. “We’re excited to offer a new way for our community to keep conversations going on their computers, where they’re already working, learning, and browsing,” the company said. Below is the video of the Snapchat for Web announcement."

2022.7.18,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/18/cotis-hard-fork-testnet-multidag-2-0-scheduled-august-2/,"Back in March, we wrote about COTI after the organization announced a plan to define a new token standard for stablecoins issued on MultiDAG 2.0 that will be the equivalent of the ERC20 token standard on Ethereum. With MultiDAG 2.0 launch, COTI will create a new token standard to rival ERC20.The expansion will also see the COTI ecosystem grow from just a single digital asset – $COTI – into one that encompasses multiple coins, including enterprise tokens, governance tokens, merchant tokens, and more. Since our last story, theCOTI team has been working behind the scene to make aradical change and upgrade to itsprotocol that will transition COTI from a single currency infrastructure to a multi-token layer. The change (also known as hard fork) is the biggest leap in COTI’s history andwill require all nodes and users to upgrade to the latest version of the COTI’s protocol. Fast forward four months later, we now have more details aboutwhat the COTI team has been up to.In a Medium post, the COTI team said it is gearing up for its biggest upgrade that will make COTI become a multi-token layer. According to the post,COTI said thehard fork testnet will take place on August 2, and the mainnet launch will be a month later. For many years, COTI’s vision is to become Enterprise Layer 1 butMultiDAG 2.0 was the missing piece in the puzzle that completes COTI’s vision to make its solution unique from others and fit the enterprises’ needs. Now, COTI is defining a new token standard issued on the Trustchain, similar to the ERC20 token on Ethereum, but on a single DAG. MultiDAG 1.0 MultiDAG 1.0 COTI’s elaborate plans to dominate the global merchant payment space were revealed in its 2022 Roadmap. The MultiDAG 2.0 Layer will enable one of the most exciting features of COTI’s Layer-1 payments infrastructure – the ability for businesses and merchants to issue branded stablecoins pegged to the value of real-world fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. By doing so, businesses will be able to avoid the volatility that comes from dealing with traditional cryptocurrencies. MultiDAG 2.0 MultiDAG 2.0 The MultiDAG 2.0 Layer is based on “directed acyclic graph technology”, which stores transaction data in a kind of tree graph as opposed to a regular blockchain, where data is processed in a linear fashion. This unique design makes it possible for up to 100,000 transactions a second to be processed simultaneously, making DAG infrastructure-based payments far more scalable and efficient than traditional blockchains. Transactions are cheaper too, with COTI claiming zero fees for all payments processed. In a statement,Shahaf Bar-Geffen, COTI’s CEO said: “CMD, the New Token Standard for COTI, represents the MultiDAG 2.0 launch and is the most significant milestone for COTI. By Supporting issuance of tokens on top of our protocol, we are accomplishing our vision in becoming enterprise layer 1. Years of hard work have culminated in this game-changing event and I can’t wait to see more enterprises using COTI’s technology”. COTI also explained that MultiDAG 2.0 will enable its existingCOTI Pay offeringto work with native COTI assets such as Djed, Shen and the various enterprise tokens it launches in both retail and merchant transactions. The COTI Treasury was launched in February but despite being less than two months old it has been a big success. The Treasury acts as a pool that collects all of the rewards from the expansive COTI ecosystem. To date, COTI said more than 330 million $COTI have so far been deposited in the Treasury. Anyone who stakes their $COTI tokens in the Treasury pool is entitled to a share of these rewards and will also receive a number of governance tokens, based on what they have staked, via an airdrop later in the year."

In an announcement on Monday, the reserve bank of the Netherlands (DNB) said it fined Binance $3.35 million (3.3 million euros) for offering services in the Netherlands without registration in the country and violation of Dutch money-laundering laws. According to a report from Reuters, the DNB said that “Binance had been in violation of Dutch money-laundering laws and had enjoyed a competitiveadvantage against companies that do have a DNB registration during the period it was in non-compliance. The violation took place between at least May 2020 and Dec. 1, 2021. The DNB formally revealed Monday that the regulator enforced the administrative fine against Binance in April 2022, following a public warning issued against Binance in August 2021. In another statement, the DNBsaid that Binance had indicated in June it would appeal the charges. According to the regulator, Binance had a “very large number of customers in the Netherlands,” while its day-to-day trading volumes totaled up to “$13.7 billion.” A Binancespokesperson said in an emailed reaction the fine marked a “pivot in our ongoing collaboration” with the DNB. The spokesperson added that Binance has since set up a local company branch, Binance Nederland BV. However, the DNB said it has not yet approved Binance’s registration but it had reduced the fine it had originally intended by 5% because the company has “been relatively transparent about its operations throughout the process.” The spokesperson added,“With this now behind us, we can continue pursuing a more traditional operating model in the Netherlands.” The DNB said it has not yet approved Binance’s registration but it had lessened the fine it had originally intended by 5% because the company has “been relatively transparent about its operations throughout the process”.

The latest round brings the total raised by TAE Technologies to$1.2 billion, making the startup a member of the highly-coveted unicorn club. Unlike conventional nuclear power that uses nuclear fission which involves the splitting of a large unstable nucleus into smaller elements and generates long-lived radioactive waste, TAE Technologies is taking an unconventional approach to generatingcarbon-free energy using nuclear fusion, a process that releases large amounts of energy with no greenhouse gas emissions and limited long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear fusion occurs when nuclei of lightweight elements (typically hydrogen) collide with enough force to fuse and form a heavier element – a process that releases substantial amounts of energy with no greenhouse gas emissions and limited long-lived radioactive waste. Founded in 1998 with the goal of buildinga “commercial fusion power source that is compact, cost-effective, capable of sustaining the planet for centuries, and safe in every way,” the company said on its website. TAE said it aims tobuild commercial-scale fusion reactors and deliver energy to the grid in the early 2030s. “The caliber and interest of our investors validates our significant technical progress and supports our goal to begin commercialization of fusion by the end of this decade,” said Michl Binderbauer, CEO of TAE Technologies. “Global energy demand is growing exponentially, and we have a moral obligation to do our utmost to develop a baseload power solution that is safe, carbon-free, and economically viable.” In a statement announcing Tuesday’s funding round, Jim Gable, president of Chevron Technology Ventures, the energy company’s corporate venture capital arm, said:“TAE — and fusion technology as a whole — has the potential to be a scalable source of no-carbon energy generation and a key enabler of grid stability as renewables become a greater portion of the energy mix.” TAE Technologies is one of the many clean energy Chevron has invested in the last two years. In August 2020, we wrote about Chevron after the energy giantinvested inSeattle, Washington-based nuclear fusion startupZap Energy. Chevron joins Italy’s ENI and Norwegian state oil company Equinor which have also backed nuclear fusion startups to reduce their carbon footprint. The company didnot disclose the amount of the investment. Meanwhile,Google has been partnering with TAE since 2014.

Today, afounding member of Elon Musk’s Neuralink has left the company, according to a report from Reuters, citing two people familiar with the matter.The news is the latest in a string of high-profile departures at the brain implant startup Musk co-founded six years ago. The sources told Reuters that Paul Merolla, whoworked on the Neuralink chip design program and helped launch the company, is no longer with the Silicon Valley-based startup. The sources did not elaborate on whyMerolla decided to leave the company.Merolla, Musk, and Neuralink representatives also did not respond to requests for comment. The two sources also told Reuters that Merolla was one of the original eight people, along with Musk, who helped start Neuralink years ago. With his exit, only one Neuralink founding member, implant engineer Dongjin “DJ” Seo, now remains with the company in addition to Musk. We wrote about Neuralink last year ago after the company shared a video of a monkey playing a video game with his mind using a brain chip. During the demonstration,Muskshared a video ofPager, a nine-year-old Macaque, playing a MindPong video game telepathically using a brain chip.In a series of tweets, Musk explained that the first Neuralinkproduct will enable someone with paralysis to use a smartphone with their mind faster than someone using thumbs. Musk added thatlater versions of Neuralink will be able to “shunt signals from Neuralinks in the brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again.” A year ago,Neuralink raised $205 million in a Series C funding round led by Dubai-based venture capital firm Vy Capital, with participation from Alphabet Inc’s Google Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Craft Ventures, and Founders Fund. The company said the funding would be used to implant wireless chips into the human brain and cure diseases Co-founded by Musk in 2016, the San Francisco-based Neuralink is working towards improving the brain-machine implant process until the procedure becomes as seamless as Lasik. The company also claimed that its Neuralink device can make anyone superhuman by connecting their brains to a computer."
2022.7.19,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/19/coinbase-backed-portal-announces-equity-offering-republic/,"Portal, a Coinbase-backed crypto startup and cross-chain Layer-2 DEX network being built on Bitcoin, today announced its Reg D equity offering through Republic, a multi-asset investment platform that allows anyone to invest foras little as $10 in vetted, startups and private companies.The public sale began on Monday, July 18th. With this offering, wider masses can now own a piece of an exciting project building a full-fledged DeFi ecosystem as layers on the Bitcoin blockchain. The announcement comes just three months afterPortaljoined forces with Mintlayer, a Bitcoin sidechain protocol that aims to bring decentralized financial markets to the masses. The new partnership will bring Portal’s uncensorable cross-chain DEX functionality to Mintlayer, giving new impetus to Bitcoin-based decentralized finance (DeFi). Portal is extending the capabilities of Bitcoin to lay a more robust foundation for self-sovereign finance. The team truly believes that the participants make the project, and want to ensure that those who support delivery of a truly decentralized financial network, including collaborators, users, and Republic investors alike, enjoy the growth of the company as much as the founders do. By making ownership of Portal available to the public, it is extending the accessibility of its operations (and profits) to the wider masses. According to Republic, their vetting process only approves 3% of startups to fundraise on the platform. The equity offering will allow the general public to invest in an ambitious project building DeFi on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Founded in 2018 by CEOEric Martindale, Chandra Duggirala, George Burke, Manoj Duggirala, and Travis Skweres, the San Francisco-based PortalPortal enables crypto investors to trade crypto anywhere without putting coins at risk, all from within a controllable wallet. Portal CEO Eric Martindale said, “The signal remains strong in the storm — Bitcoin remains the most likely candidate upon which the future of financial infrastructure will be built. As Bitcoin’s metrics continue to achieve all-time highs, Portal is eager to bring on this new round of investors in pursuit of advancing Bitcoin-based infrastructure and the continued decentralization of traditional financial services.” The Reg D equity offering via Republic’s platform comes as Portal prepares to launch its testnet in the coming weeks. It is building a full-fledged, censorship-resistant DeFi ecosystem on top of the Bitcoin network. Though Bitcoin is often seen just as digital money, Portal is leveraging the Bitcoin network as the rails for building many layers of censorship-resistant financial applications on top of it. Every geopolitical event over the last year has reinforced the need for a censorship-resistant global financial system. The peer-to-peer atomic swaps underpinning Portal provide true decentralization, enabling users to trade native Layer-1 assets across different blockchains without delays, blocked funds, or exploits. Portal’s Layer 2 and Layer 3 technology not only expands the cross-chain functionality of Bitcoin, but also simplifies building censorship-resistant communications, media and one-click execution of cross-chain swaps on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. It facilitates the private, off-chain execution of “smart contracts” for asset issuance, swaps, staking, liquidity, derivatives, and more, all peer-to-peer, without third-party custody or control. Participation Details Investors from around the world, including the residents and citizens of the United States, will be able to participate in the sale. They’ll have the option to fund their purchases via fiat or in BTC, USDT, USDC or ETH. The number of investors is limited to about 1,900. Portal expects the Reg D offering to sell out very fast. Portal is DeFi built on Bitcoin. It makes trade unstoppable with anonymous, zero-knowledge swaps via the first true cross-chain DEX that’s trust-minimized. It eliminates the need for minting wrapped coins (ie wBTC, wETH) or risky staking with intermediaries. With Portal, DeFi becomes a service that anyone can provide, maintaining anonymity within open, transparent markets with a security model as robust as Bitcoin mining.To date, Portal had earlier raised $8.5 million from Coinbase and other big-name investors. Portal’s Layer 2 and Layer 3 technology enables building censorship-resistant communications, media and one-click cross-chain swaps, all on Bitcoin."

These approval decisions were made by algorithms. Unfortunately, this is not new. It has been going on for decades.Another report by an online real estate platform Zillow found that Black applicants were denied a mortgage at an 84% higher rate than White applicants in 2020, up 10% from 2019.Now one tech startup is aiming to change that. Enter FairPlay,a fintech startup that uses AI fairness techniques to reduce algorithmic bias for people of color, women, and other historically disadvantaged groups. FairPlay is theworld’s first provider of“Fairness-as-a-Service” solutionsto reduce bias in lending. To further scale its solution and grow its team, FairPlay announced today it has raised $10 million in Series A funding led by Nyca Partners, with participation from Cross River Digital Ventures, Third Prime, Fin Capital, TTV, Nevcaut Ventures, Financial Venture Studio, and Jonathan Weiner. FairPlay will also use the funding proceeds to grow its engineering and data science teams and expand its products into the insurance, marketing, and fraud industries. In conjunction with the funding, FairPlay also announced that Manny Alvarez, the former Commissioner of the California Department of Financial Protection and David Silberman, the former Acting Deputy Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have joined the company as advisors along with fintech executive Kim Gerhardt. Founded in 2020 by co-founder and CEO Kareem Saleh, the Los Angeles-basedFairPlay was launched in response to calls for greater action against systemic bias andto combat the threats algorithmic systems pose to the safety of consumers and society, by building a fairness infrastructure to de-bias digital decisions in real-time. Over the years, algorithms are increasingly being used to make high-stakes decisions about people’s lives in lending, insurance, employment, predictive policing, and other areas. FairPlay’s rigorous and easy-to-use algorithmic fairness solutions empower lenders to identify and mitigate bias in their credit models, increasing profitability and financial inclusion. “Fairness-as-a-Service is growing fast,” says Kareem Saleh, Founder and CEO of FairPlay. “Lenders use FairPlay because they believe, as we do, that fairness is good for people, profits, and progress. We are excited to use this new funding to further invest in our products, grow our team and bring Fairness-as-a-Service to new markets.” Commenting on the funding,Tom Brown, Partner and General Counsel at Nyca Partners, said, “FairPlay is the first company on a mission to raise the bar in algorithmic fairness in lending and has a strong team to lead the way. Their innovative solutions and the growth they’ve seen in less than two years make them a perfect fit for Nyca Partners.” FairPlay offers two APIs. The first API provides Fairness Analysis, analyzing a lending model’s inputs, outputs and outcomes to identify if disparities exist and for which historically disadvantaged groups. The second API, Second Look, leverages Fairness Aware AI technologies to re-underwrite declined loan applications for borrowers from protected groups. The technology assesses whether applicants declined by the primary algorithm resemble ‘good’ borrowers in ways that weren’t previously considered. The result is that more applicants from underserved groups are responsibly approved for loans, reducing bias and increasing lenders’ profitability. FairPlay’s customers include Figure Technologies, Happy Money, and Octane. “At Octane, we use technology and artificial intelligence to make lifestyle purchases fast, easy, and accessible,” said Ray Duggins, Chief Risk Officer at Octane. “Our partnership with FairPlay helps us to ensure our decisioning models are fair as we connect people with their passions and fuel our customers’ lifestyles.” “Consumers from all walks of life are demanding fairness from their governments, their employers, and the brands they patronize,” said Saleh. “Our Fairness-as-a-Service solution is for companies who want the economic, regulatory, and reputational benefits of being fair.”"

2022.7.20,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/20/human-protocol-unveils-new-decentralized-routing-protocol-coordinate-distributed-job-markets/,"The HUMAN Protocol team has been busy over the past few months.The decentralizedinfrastructure project made a splash late last year when it launched its HUMAN App with over 200,000 users. Then in May,HUMAN Protocol awarded a grant to VeritaTrust to power on-chain reviews tofurther enable more developers to build on its protocol. Today,Human Protocol unveiled a new blockchain coordination layer to handle routing functionality among third-party vendors to power data contribution on the network. The feature,known as the Routing Protocol, sits atop the existing Human to enable the discovery of network generators, fee agreements, consensus job standards, proof of balance, and governance support for seamless consensus-based network upgrades. Human Protocol started outvia an on-chain bot blocker called hCaptcha, whichrewards individual workers for the key ML work they were completing by solving these CAPTCHAs. Today, the hCaptcha hasevolved to become a broader solution for tokenizing contribution. HUMAN Protocol explains that the Routing Protocolfeatures are core elements of its mission to create a more human world that’s decentralized yet connected, with every viewpoint and background accounted for and represented, and where all value produced is rewarded. The HUMAN Protocol facilitates direct, globally-mapped connections that bring workers closer to the rewards of their work, organizations to workforces, and machines to understanding. The open-source infrastructure startup also said that the Routing Protocol is expected to accelerate the adoption of HUMAN Protocol by making it simpler for anyone to operate a network entity such as an Exchange Oracle. As an execution layer, it focuses on coordination between actors participating directly in the completion of work. It enables network actors to extend the functionality of their service while remaining compatible with standardized APIs, for example by offering a new job type, and to transparently setting their own fee for services. The Routing Protocol resolves these limitations through its ability to coordinate third-party tool vendors such as oracles, job exchanges, and L1 integrations for job listings and workpool operators. Third parties can subscribe to the Routing Protocol to participate. Development of the Routing Protocol is a community-led effort spearheaded by developers and designers from across the HUMAN Protocol ecosystem. It’s an ambitious project that remains a work in progress, with numerous components currently being prototyped by the community. As an open-source project, the HUMAN Protocol invites everyone to participate in public repos and contribute their ideas towards its ongoing development. Clear and open communication is also encouraged to minimize duplicative effort. The overall design of the Routing Protocol is expected to evolve over time as the individual components are built and refined. Once the basic groundwork has been established and certain milestones are achieved, a blueprint of the technology will be published via a forthcoming whitepaper. Founded by co-founder and CTOAlex Newman,HUMAN Protocol is a broadly applicable solution to the management of distributed workforces. It started by bringing hCaptcha – the bot blocker – on-chain, to reward individual workers for the key ML work they were completing by solving these CAPTCHAs. This, however, has become a more broad solution to the tokenization of any contribution; and, therefore, the ability to orchestrate the management of that work, the evaluation of it, and the reward of micropayments to many individuals. In this sense, reviews are just another form of work, or value contribution, that can be rewarded via blockchains. HUMAN anticipated the applicability of such a project in their blog release about the potential of projects, like VeritaTrust, made possible by blockchain technology."

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency surged past $24,000, a level not seen since mid-June. Bitcoin is now trading at $24,177 before falling a little back to $24,022 as of the time of writing. Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency benefitting from the booming market. Ether, the second most popular cryptocurrency, also climbed above $1,600 amid optimism over a highly anticipated upgrade to its network known as the “Merge.”  However, we will be remiss if we don’t put the latest rally in perspective.Bitcoin is still down by about 50% since the start of this year. In a statement,Antoni Trenchev, CEO of crypto lender Nexo offers some rays of hope saying“This isn’t necessarily the end of the crypto bear market, but a relief rally for Bitcoin is long overdue.” “Bitcoin is beginning to find its feet after a shaky month, and the next week will be telling,” Trenchev added. That’s not all. Some crypto analysts even made morehawkish projections that bitcoin will be trading at $1 million by 2030. FX Empire Bob Mason noted that by carrying out a cursory extrapolation of bitcoin price movements since 2017, the analysts said that bitcoin is projected to hit a run rate of $191,000 by January 2030. “BTC Monthly Chart 2030 Price ExtrapolationWhen considering the price impact of bitcoin halving on a four-yearly basis, a step mechanism needs to be included in the extrapolation to reflect the impact of each event on BTC. Between now and 2030, two halving events will occur, one in May 2024 and the second in May 2028. Looking at the historical halving events, First Halving – November 28, 2012 – BTC surged from $12 to a November 28, 2013, high of $1,050 (+8,650%). Second Halving – July 9, 2016 – BTC surged from $664 to a July 9, 2017, high of $2,556 (+285%). Third Halving – May 11, 2020 – BTC surged from $8,721 to a May 11, 2021, high of $55,831 (+540%). Based on the above, bitcoin has surged by an average of 3,158% in the one year after each halving event. By removing the 2012 anomaly, the average increase is 412.5%. Using the extrapolation from January 2017 to an extrapolated May 2024 projected price of $108,000 and incorporating a 1-year price increase of 413% between May 2024 and May 2025, BTC could hit $446,000. Incorporating the estimated 413% increase between May 2028 and May 2029, BTC would be on target to hit $2.08 million by May 2029, giving BTC a January 2030 value of $2.11 million.” Mason stated that the predictions are based on the assumptions that “bitcoin mining support remains firm, the crypto market regulatory framework supports innovation and the evolution of cryptos as an alternative asset class, bitcoin Whales numbers hold steady while increasing bitcoin holdings, crypto asset adoption continues to grow at current rates, and there is no catastrophic crypto market event.”"

Now, one web3 tech startup is supporting purpose-driven organizations & creators with the first social token grant fund to fuel the next generation of impact-focused micro-economies. Today,Socialstack announced the launch ofa $350,000 grant fund for organizations and creators to launch social tokens that advance social and environmental action. This kicks off our ‘Summer Of Action.’ Applications for up to $50,000 grants are now live with an August 31st submission deadline. As the first grant fund ever established for social tokens, the fund will provide purpose-driven organizations and creators with monetary and in-kind support. Social tokens are cryptocurrencies issued by a brand, community, or creator where the value of the token is derived from the underlying social capital of the community and the utility that the issuer creates for the token.  “We are thrilled to partner with Celo to establish a grant fund to bring purpose-driven organizations and creators into Web3 through social tokens,” said Andrew Berkowitz, CEO of Socialstack. “We aim to advance the immense potential of Web3 by providing funding and infrastructure to ambitious projects looking to enter Web3 with purpose.” In conjunction with the launch, Socialstack also announced the globally renowned Gen Z movement leader Chelsea Miller as its Activist-In-Residence. Miller is the Co-Founder of Freedom March NYC, one of the largest U.S. youth-led civil rights organizations, created after the murder of George Floyd. She has been on the frontlines of civic engagement, reproductive rights, and more. Recently named the Muhammad Ali Foundation’s 2021 Humanitarian of the Year, Miller is one of the leading voices in youth activism with a very engaged following on social media. She has addressed thousands in speaking engagements including the 2020 March on Washington and Michele Obama’s Culture of Democracy Summit and worked with brands including Nike and Puma. “Web3 has the potential to build power through communities in new and innovative ways.” said Miller, “Socialstack is an example of what happens when we lead with impact in the digital space – lives are changed and the world can be better from it.” Socialstack aims to fund a diverse representation of builders with two initial grant recipients: Silicon Harlem and Picture Motion. Silicon Harlem was founded ten years ago to onboard Harlem and other urban markets into technology and innovation, recently opening a marquee innovation center with support from several of the world’s most influential corporations. The grant will initially support an activation during Harlem Week, and the two organizations have already come together on a longer-term vision rooted in community resiliency. Picture Motion is an award-winning impact agency for entertainment that develops and implements campaigns to maximize the power of film to ignite progressive change. The agency has led campaigns for Questlove’s 2022 Oscar-Winning documentary Summer of Soul showcasing never-before-seen footage of Black joy and culture at the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival, and riveting documentaries Beyond The Flood and 13th. The grant will initially support a first-of-its-kind activation intersecting film, impact, and Web3 around various impact areas. “Digital literacy and access to broadband have been at the forefront of Silicon Harlem’s commitment to upper Manhattan for over a decade.” said Clayton Banks, Cofounder and CEO of Silicon Harlem, “We’re excited to partner with Socialstack to bring upper Manhattan’s rich culture into Web3, and create incentives for local residents to earn crypto and goods through positive community action.” In addition to financial support, recipients will receive pro-bono services from the Socialstack team leveraging their expertise via informational events, office hours, and bespoke services from the company’s Web3 Studio. Tokens on Socialstack incentivize positive action that includes mental health, climate action, civic engagement, and more, alongside helping communities advance their commerce and community goals. Their strategic vision is to hone in on the power of communities using tokens to orchestrate community actions in a bespoke digital economy, where all of its stakeholders receive upside, including a very important stakeholder – the planet. Socialstack has also launched communities including Starboard, the leading sustainability-driven water sports brand, into Web3. Starboard’s community has already removed over 500,000 pounds of ocean plastic while earning token incentives which can be redeemed for planting trees, merchandise, and more. Other notable communities include the first social token for a nonprofit (Project Zero), Africa’s top NFT creator (Osinachi), and international DJ BLOND:ISH’s sustainability initiative (Bye Bye Plastic Foundation), to which Socialstack deployed its first-ever grant to. The company launched the first social token experience at Christie’s in the fall. Contributing a portion of profits or token allocation to a charity is a simple copy-and-paste concept from the old paradigm. Many efficiencies are introduced by Web3 to activate advocates, social media followers, and new community members. Creating systems to advance solutions for the challenges nonprofits aim to solve through a decentralized network of task completion can truly bring forward outcomes."
2022.7.20,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/20/fintech-startup-bluejay-finance-raises-2-9m-build-decentralized-multi-currency-stablecoin-protocol-asian-market/,"While Southeast Asia’s economy has come a long way over the last decade, more than six out of ten Southeast Asians still remain underbanked or unbanked today. In addition,more than 1 billion people within the region still have no access to traditional financial services and no bank account. Now, one fintech startup is on a mission to change that by improving financial inclusion with Asia-focused stablecoins and leveling the playing forbusinesses and individuals to do business within Southeast Asia countries. EnterBluejay Finance,the first Asia-focused capital-efficient protocol for multi-currency stablecoins.By having stablecoins of different currencies around the world on the blockchain, Bluejay Finance lowers the barrier for businesses and individuals in these countries to transact and minimizes currency exchange risk, making payments and access to capital easier and more efficient. Today,Bluejay Finance announced it has raised $2.9 million to build out its capital-efficient decentralized stablecoin protocol for issuing stablecoins pegged to real-world currencies, which solves the problem of dollar-fixation within the industry, giving DeFi users alternative options denominated in such currencies as the Singapore Dollar and Philippine Peso. Funding for this round came from Zee Prime Capital, C2 Ventures, Stake Capital Group, RNR Capital, Daedalus Angels, Moonlanding Ventures, Oval Ventures, and more, with operator-angels including DeFi projects like Ribbon Finance, Flux, Voltz, and Alpha Venture Dao. Founded in 2021 by CEO Sherry Jiang andRaymond Yeh,Bluejay Finance aims to build an avenue for investors to have more stablecoin solutions centered around currencies other than USD in the DeFi space. Bluejay aims to mirror the foreign exchange market in the fiat world onto the blockchain, in order to accelerate financial inclusion and access to DeFi for all users and businesses. Unlike the current global stablecoins like USDT, Bluejay believes that “local stablecoins are key building blocks for the next wave of crypto users and payment ecosystems.” Bluejay will use the funding proceeds for team development and stablecoin deployment, focusing on Asian stablecoins, such as the Singapore Dollar and the Philippine Peso, and will distribute them through partners like DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges, centralized exchanges, and fintech companies. In doing so, this will allow investors to have a more inclusive, locally-familiar medium of exchange that limits foreign exchange risk and exchange fees. Highlighting financial inclusion in Asia With 60 percent of Southeast Asians being underbanked or unbanked, and 70 percent of Southeast Asian workforce lacking in bank accounts, there’s a clear need to prioritize financial inclusion. Often, there’s been a lack of formal credit history hindering access to capital for MSMEs, and a general lack of urgency and awareness around possessing a personal savings account. Fortunately, there have been recent opportunities for Asia, thanks to the region’s strong mobile penetration driving a variety of financial services and payment gateways for both individuals and businesses. Improving financial inclusion with Asia-focused stablecoins Stablecoins can play a meaningful role in the future of financial services in Asia. However, most stablecoin solutions are centered around USD and are not suitable for real-world usage where transactions are denominated in local currencies; this means that users do not have a choice of having exposure to currencies other than USD in the DeFi space, which exposes users to extra costs, forcing them to use the unfamiliar currency. By having stablecoins of different currencies around the world on the blockchain, Bluejay Finance lowers the barrier for businesses and individuals in these countries to transact and minimizes currency exchange risk, making payments and access to capital easier and more efficient. “DeFi summer was the first wave of innovation, driven by yield farming. Despite the current state of the markets right now, we are incredibly bullish that the next cycle will be driven by sustainable, real use cases that solve a true need. Therefore, Bluejay remains focused on building products and partnerships that will enable these sustainable use cases of stablecoins and bring in the next billion users into DeFi,” says Sherry Jiang, founder of Bluejay Finance. Julien Bouteloup, founder of Stake Capital Group, comments, “Over the course of the past few years, stablecoins have proven to be a fundamental primitive within DeFi. However, most stablecoins have revolved around the US dollar. For crypto to branch into use cases like real-world payments and money markets, it needs to have stablecoins that people in local economies can seamlessly transact with, such as the Euro and Singapore Dollar. Bluejay is positioned to address this need, which will only continue to grow as DeFi matures.” Recently, Bluejay Finance announced its partnership with Silta Finance, a protocol focused on sustainable real-world assets and plans to announce more partnerships in the coming weeks on both its Twitter and Discord communities."
2022.7.20,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/20/decentralized-platform-earthfund-dr-lucy-tweed-team-launch-dao-dedicated-fighting-climate-change/,"Back in June, we wrote about EarthFund after the decentralized platform launched a“DAO-as-a-Service” system to allow anyone to set up funding DAOs for causes they care about andsimplify funding for world-changing causes. WithEarthFund DAO, anyone can join communities dedicated to causes you’re passionate about, crowdfund your world-changing treasury, and vote for which projects get the money they need to make an impact, the startup says on its website. Fast forward a month later,EarthFund has inked another partnership to fight the ongoing climate change plaguing our planet. Today,EarthFund announced the launch of the Carbon Removal cause in collaboration withDr. Lucy Tweed. The cause, which was founded byDr. Lucy Tweed, will focus on finding and funding community-led carbon removal projects to help fight climate change and remove carbon from the atmosphere. The objective of the Carbon Removal Cause is to ensure real, meaningful action on climate change by funding nature-based initiatives on the ground that help remove carbon and support local communities. While green technology and industrial approaches to carbon change are long-term solutions, they’re years away from being ready to scale. Nature-based solutions are available to us now and can support natural systems and enhance their uptake of CO2 by protecting and restoring carbon-rich ecosystems (forests, peatlands, salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds). Unfortunately, nature-based carbon removal is quickly becoming less about climate change and more about good PR. Large corporate players rush in, drive land grabs and restrict local communities’ access to critical resources all the while promoting tree-planting projects that are poorly suited to the local ecology and disregard local people. The Carbon Removal DAO — led by Dr. Lucy Tweed, who received her Ph.D. from Columbia University for research into carbon removal and is starting a new role as an associate climate researcher at Cambridge University — is set up to “support communities around the world to reclaim sovereignty of their land by funding nature-based carbon removal projects that put local livelihoods and environmental justice front and center.” In the Carbon Removal DAO, a global community can come together to find projects, accept crypto donations, and vote on which carbon-removing projects around the world get the funding they need to make a difference. Dr. Lucy Tweed comments on the Carbon Removal Cause: “Individual action is crucially important. Recycling, flying less, voting for progressive candidates, eating less meat… are all great. But to accelerate climate action we need to come together to create scalable models for broader systemic change. This is no secret. The problem is that there hasn’t been a tool for collective, meaningful, and coordinated global action until now. The Carbon Removal cause is an accessible and inclusive community where people can come together as a collective to support sustainable community-led carbon removal projects and bring about real change.” EarthFund CEO Adam Boalt adds: “We’re all incredibly excited for Dr Tweed to be launching her cause on our platform. Not only is she going to be conducting research into carbon storage at Cambridge University, but through her cause on the EarthFund platform, she’s also going to be growing a global community that gets rewarded for being the driving force behind finding and funding carbon removal projects around the world. This is what we built EarthFund for — to give ordinary people the tools they need to bring about real change on a global scale. We can’t wait to see what the Carbon Removal DAO achieves.” The Carbon Removal DAO will focus on funding various approaches to fighting climate change, including protecting carbon-rich ecosystems, restoring ecosystems, regenerative agriculture, and piloting new approaches to carbon removal. And every project will community-first, making sure that climate action doesn’t come at the cost of local livelihoods. On July 27, EarthFund will drop the CarbonCommons tokens to its community members. The token will not be listed on a decentralized exchange or other trading platform, but can be swapped for 1Earth on the EarthFund platform. Once a user has the CarbonCommons token, they’ll be able to vote on projects and proposals, get rewarded in USDT for their involvement, and join Dr. Lucy Tweed and other climate activists, scientists, and advocates in an exclusive Discord channel. EarthFund is the first-of-its-kind crypto-native crowdfunding platform for projects and ideas that can make the world a better place. EarthFund’s native token — “1Earth” — can be bought directly from earthfund.io or traded on KuCoin, Uniswap and Gate.io and lets token holders get rewarded for participating in self-governed, cause-focused communities by voting on which projects to support and fund. By holding 1Earth and joining EarthFund communities, everybody will be able to have a meaningful voice in the shape of tomorrow."

On Monday, the FBI warned financialinstitutions and investors about fraudulent cryptocurrency applications that have scammed 244 victims out of about $42.7 million since October 2021. “The FBI has identified 244 victims and estimates theapproximate loss associated with this activity to be $42.7 million. The FBI encourages financialinstitutions and their customers who suspect they have been defrauded through fakecryptocurrency investment apps to contact the FBI via the Internet Crime Complaint Center ortheir local FBI field office,”the warning, published on Monday, said. The FBI also said that it“has observed cybercriminals contacting US investors, fraudulently claiming to offer legitimate cryptocurrency investment services, and convincing investors to download fraudulent mobile apps, which the cybercriminals have used with increasing success over time to defraud the investors of their cryptocurrency.” The agency also identified an appoperated by cybercriminals calledYiBit, an app that claimed to be “a decentralized artificial intelligence digital asset trading platform based on the FinChain protocol that provides users with quality services.” The FBI said that between 4 October 2021 and 13 May 2022, YiBit defrauded at least four victims of $5.5 million. The operator of YiBit appconvinced the victims to download the YiBit app and depositcryptocurrency into wallets associated with the victims’ YiBit accounts. Following thesedeposits, 17 victims received an email stating they had to pay taxes on their investmentsbefore withdrawing funds; all 4 victims could not withdraw funds through the app. The FBI said another app, called Supayos, or Supay, asked for deposits and then froze one user’s funds after telling him the minimum balance requirement was $900,000. Between 1 November and 26 November 2021, cybercriminals operating under thecompany name Supayos, AKA Supay2, defrauded two victims by instructing them todownload the Supay app and make multiple cryptocurrency deposits into walletsassociated with their Supay accounts. “In November 2021, the cybercriminals told onevictim, he was enrolled in a program requiring a minimum balance of $900,000 withouthis consent; upon trying to cancel the subscription, the victim was instructed to deposit the requested funds or have all assets frozen,” the FBI said. To avoid becoming the next victim of crypto fraud, the FBI recommends that financial institutions “proactively warn customers about this activity and provide steps customers can take toreport it and also inform customers as to whether the financial institution offers cryptocurrencyinvestment services or other related services.”"

It has also caused consumers to shift to climate-friendly, plant-based meats instead of the traditional ones made from animals. With the world’s population forecast to hit 10 billion people by 2050, a more sustainable way to keep up with growing meat demand is needed. Recognizing that people’s eating habits will only change if they are provided with convenient, delicious, and cost-equivalent alternatives,Meati Foods (formerly Emergy Foods), has created alternative whole-food proteins made from the mushroom root,an edible type of mycelium, the thread-like vegetative part of a fungus. Today, Meati announced it has raised $150 million in a Series C investment round that will help to expand the production and accessibility of the company’s popular products as they aim to become the U.S. market share leader in plant-based meat by 2025. The round was led by Revolution Growth, with participation from existing and new investors, including Grosvenor Food & AgTech, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), Wellington Management, and Cultivate Next, Chipotle Mexican Grill’s new venture fund which includes Meati Foods in its first cohort of investments. “The continued growth and momentum that Meati is experiencing underscore how differentiated and scalable our products and vision are,” said Meati Foods CEO and co-founder,Tyler Huggins. “Revolution Growth and our new and existing investors bring not just the financial firepower and ethos alignment, but deep and diversified expertise that will be instrumental in building a brand and organization that will truly change how people eat in a way that’s better for our bodies and better for our planet.”  Meati™ has distanced itself from an ever-crowded category through its standard-setting composition of at least 95 percent mushroom root, earning its whole-food distinction and unmatched nutrition. The delicious, whole-cut meats naturally deliver as much as 17 grams of complete protein (33 percent of the daily recommended value according to theFDA) and 12 grams of dietary fiber (42 percent of the daily recommended value), along with micronutrients such as 45 percent and 90 percent of the recommended daily intakes of zinc and vitamin B12 (riboflavin). The funds will support the completion of the company’s more than 100,000-square-footMega RanchinThornton, Colo., a facility that will begin to ship product in late 2022, ultimately producing tens of millions of pounds of product annually. Additionally, the company will continue its rapid growth, including a national omnichannel footprint by the end of 2023, diversification of its product portfolio, as well as breaking ground on the company’s first “Giga Ranch“, designed to be the production facility that will be replicated domestically and globally, with a single ranch capable of producing hundreds of millions of pounds annually. “Meati Foods’ innovative products mirror Chipotle’s Food with Integrity standards and bring an exciting, new alternative protein to market,” saidCurt Garner, Chief Technology Officer at Chipotle. “Through Chipotle’s Cultivate Next venture fund we are investing in companies that align with our mission to Cultivate a Better World and Meati is doing just that with their clean processes and plant-based proteins.” Meati is also working to change the way we eat by democratizing access to delicious, nutrient-rich, complete protein in a way that protects and preserves our planet’s water, land, and air. Eat Meati is the debut product line from Meati Foods featuring whole-food cutlets and steaks made from mushroom roots via modernized ancient, natural processes in a toxicity-free environment with no heavy metals, pesticides, or antibiotics. Eat Meati made its retail debut in July 2022 after multiple months of record sellouts on its direct-to-doorstep online shop, with plans for a national omnichannel footprint by late 2023.

2022.7.21,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/21/great-attrition-40-global-workers-considering-quitting-jobs-theyre-going/,"Forget about the Great Resignation. There’s a more worrisome trend brewing among global workers as a vicious cycle of low wages, job dissatisfaction, flexibility, and work-life balance is leading millions to quit their jobs in droves. In the summer of 2021,a record 4.3 million Americans voluntarily quit their jobsin what some are calling the beginning of the“Great Resignation.”It was one of thehighest “quit rates” ever recorded since the government started keeping track two decades ago. Unfortunately,the situation did not get any better as the year came to a close as a record of over 20 million people quit their jobs in the second half of 2021,according to the government’s jobs report released in the first week of 2022. TheGreat Resignation is a term firstcoined by Texas A&M University professor Anthony Klotz and has become another buzzword on social media. Klotz argues that “when there’s uncertainty, people tend to stay put, so there are pent-up resignations that didn’t happen over the past year.” But now, there is a new phenomenon that employers and policy-makers should be worried about. It is called “The Great Attrition.”According to new research, more than 4 million people across the globe have left their jobs each month so far this year. Unfortunately, this record-breaking trend isn’t going to stop anytime soon. According toa new report by consulting giant McKinsey and Co., about 40% of global workers are considering quitting their current jobs in the next 3-to-6 months. The report, which was published last week, surveyed 13,382 people across the globe, including 6,294 Americans, between February and April. During the period, McKinsey and Co. also spoke with more than 2,800 people in six countries, Australia, Canada, India, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and theUnited States, who left their full-time jobs within the last two years to find out where they are going. In a statement,Bonnie Dowling, one of the authors of the report, says that elevated quit rates are not just a passing trend but a fundamental shift in workers’ mentality. “This isn’t just a passing trend or a pandemic-related change to the labor market. There’s been a fundamental shift in workers’ mentality, and their willingness to prioritize other things in their life beyond whatever job they hold. … We’re never going back to how things were in 2019,”Dowling said. The report didn’t end there. The report also found that workers not only quitting their jobs but they are also switching jobs and industries, moving from traditional to nontraditional roles, retiring early, or starting their own businesses. “They are taking a time-out to tend to their personal lives or embarking on sabbaticals. The Great Attrition has become the Great Renegotiation,” the report. The authors alsoprovide insights into where the workers are going. The report found that abouthalf of people leaving their jobs are switching industries. About 48% of people who quit have pursued new opportunities in different industries, the report found. While competition to find talent remains fierce, the report noted that for certain categories of workers, the barriers to switching employers have dropped dramatically. For example, in the United States alone, “there were 11.3 million open jobs at the end of May—up substantially from 9.3 million open jobs in April 2021.1 Even as employers scramble to fill these positions, the voluntary quit rate is 25 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels.2 At the current and projected pace of hiring, quitting, and job creation, openings likely won’t return to normal levels for some time.” “A lot of people realized just how volatile, or unsafe, their industry was during the pandemic, especially those working on the frontlines.More employers have opened up their aperture in order to meet the yawning talent gap that they’re facing,” Dowling adds. “They’re prioritizing skills over educational background or previous job experience, which is creating more opportunities across sectors for job-seekers.” Some industries are losing talent faster than others: More than 60% of workers who quit jobs in the consumer/retail and finance/insurance fields either switched industries or quit the workforce entirely, compared to 54% of workers in health care and education who made such a switch. While there is a fundamental shift in what global workers want, the report found that employers continue to rely on traditional levers to attract and retain people. “What we are seeing is a fundamental mismatch between companies’ demand for talent and the number of workers willing to supply it. Employers continue to rely on traditional levers to attract and retain people, including compensation, titles, and advancement opportunities.” The report further notes that ongoing rapid quitting could continue through 2022 unless employers make ‘meaningful’ changes. “For a long time, you didn’t leave a job unless you had another one lined up — that’s what everyone was taught and what people did,” she says. “But that has changed so dramatically over the last 18 months. … Now, people’s attitude is, ‘I’m confident that when I want to work, there will be something for me,’” the report notes. Instead of getting stuck in the past and continuing with the traditional hiring approach which no longer works, Dowling says that companies need to look at the shifting economic landscape in the U.S. as an opportunity to reshape how we work and build a better model. “It’s everything from embedding flexibility in our credo to re-assessing how we value our employees and provide them with the resources they need to do their job … all employers have the capacity to make these meaningful changes,” she adds. “But we have to start taking action, as opposed to sitting back and hoping that things are going to return to a ‘pre-pandemic norm’ — because all signs point to the fact that they won’t.” You can read the full report here."
2022.7.21,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/21/bitcoin-thought-leader-dan-held-joins-trust-machines-unlock-bitcoins-trillion-dollar-economy/,"Bitcoin-focused startup Trust Machines welcomes thought leader Dan Held among its ranks to enhance the development of applications for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Held is a renowned and respected name in the industry, primarily due to his ongoing educational support for the Bitcoin ecosystem. The team behind Trust Machines has made a name for itself by focusing on building real-world applications for the Bitcoin blockchain. Whereas most developers focus on offshoot networks like Ethereum or Solana for decentralized app building, none of these blockchains has the same security as Bitcoin. Moreover, Bitcoin represents not only the most secure network but also the most capital and liquidity that remains untapped by decentralized applications. Trust Machines has been chipping away at bringing such apps to Bitcoin. It is the largest app-oriented ecosystem for Bitcoin and aims to push the growth boundaries continually. Adding thought leader Dan Held – who has over 750,000 social media followers – as an advisor to the project will bring more attention to this app ecosystem. Moreover, it will increase visibility among developers and users, highlighting the potential of what Bitcoin is truly capable of. Trust Machines CEO Muneeb Ali adds:“Dan has an amazing ability to simplify complex concepts and reach large audiences. We’re seeing a revival of Bitcoin builders culture and Dan’s work with us on growth marketing can help accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin layers and unlock productive capital through Bitcoin apps.” Trust Machines leverages the success of Stacks, a programming layer for Bitcoin. When Stacks introduced its mainnet, the Bitcoin ecosystem gained programmability. With the technology in place, Trust Machines aims to make Stacks faster and easier to develop on. Additionally, several applications are in development to make Bitcoin productive, including a trustless lending solution. Q2 2022 Has been rather bullish for the Trust Machines team. Several key hires were made, including former President & COO at Coinbase Asiff Hirji, former Head of Exchange at Binance.US Rena Shah, and former Head of Comms at Lolli Aubrey Strobel. The star-studded team behind Trust machines continues to make its mark on the industry, and the addition of Dan Held is another significant step forward. Trust Machines Growth Marketing Advisor Dan Held comments:“I’m thrilled to announce my role at Trust Machines as an advisor. I believe Trust Machines and its team is uniquely positioned to bring DeFi applications to the Bitcoin protocol, inevitably unlocking trillions in value.” The primary objective for Dan is to build and scale the Trust Machines marketing department. Additionally, he will focus on developing strategies for native products and serve as an advisor to CEO Muneeb Ali. The key hires are one part of the equation, but Trust Machines also secured $150 million from investors earlier in 2022. Notable contributors include Breyer Capital, Digital Currency Group, GoldenTree, Union Square Ventures, and GoldenTree. The funding will enable Trust Machines to explore new decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities for Bitcoin."
2022.7.21,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/21/time-get-klever-one-crypto-platform/,"There’s no denying the fact that the crypto market has been on the receiving end of a lot of financial devastation recently, as is highlighted by the fact that the total capitalization of this space has dropped from $3 trillion to approximately $1 trillion over the past half a year or so. However, it would be wrong to say that the aforementioned volatility has been relegated solely to the digital asset industry as other traditional markets — such as stocks, commodities, etc — have been gripped by massive bearish pressure over the same time window. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, in particular, is a niche that has continued to witness a lot of growth recently. To this point, since Q1 2021, the total value locked (TVL) within this space has risen from a handsome $18B to its current levels of approx. $83B, suggesting that despite the sluggish macroeconomic landscape, more and more individuals are continuing to make their way into the DeFi market. Statistically speaking, research studies suggest that within the next 5 years (i.e. by 2028) this market will reach a cumulative valuation of $507.92B at a steady CAGR of 43.8%. This is because experts see DeFi-enabled tech as having the power to eliminate the need for middlemen/financial intermediaries such as banks, brokerage firms, etc. Furthermore, thanks to the advent of smart contracts, i.e. automated pieces of code that execute when certain predefined conditions are met, it is possible for DeFi systems to maximize consumer transparency, and execute complex transactions (such as interest payments), and other highly seamless, trustless manner. With the digital finance landscape continuing to evolve at a breakneck pace, more and more investors are beginning to turn to DeFi platforms that provide them with a comprehensive suite of products capable of meeting all of their crypto needs under one roof. In this regard, Klever is best viewed as an all-inclusive gateway to the global decentralized economy that comes replete with a wide range of products and services including a crypto wallet, currency swap, web browser, exchange, staking, payment channels, etc. To start with, Klever’s native operating system (OS) affords developers the ability to run smart contracts as well as secure their personal wallets within their apps, cloud services, servers, hardware, smartphones, pen drives, mobile devices, and even wearables. On the other hand, the Klever App hosts numerous services that allow users to buy/sell digital assets, process crypto-to-fiat (and vice versa) transactions, play blockchain-enabled games, and utilize decentralized finance solutions with full anonymity and privacy. Klever Swap, as the name suggests, is a platform that allows users to exchange various cryptocurrencies for one another in a quick, convenient fashion. It keeps a close tab on the live price action of various top-tier exchanges, subsequently creating a price index that helps facilitate the many swaps in question. Lastly, Klever Exchange is a trading ecosystem that can be used by beginners as well as advanced traders with ease. It makes use of a technology called gRPC, a robust open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework used to build scalable and fast APIs. As a result of this, it is able to not only deliver a high degree of security and intuitive user experience but is also able to support 1M+ transactions per second. A key aspect of Klever worth highlighting is the recent launch of its mainnet — ala KleverChain — which coincided right on time with the platform’s original roadmap. In its most basic sense, KleverChain is designed to be a trusted and permissionless blockchain network capable of helping the emerging decentralized economy grow further. To elaborate, the mainnet offers utility in the form of a proof-of-stake public blockchain, which by its very design is scalable and comes with pre-built, ready-to-use apps. Technically speaking, KleverChain’s unique operational framework allows it to handle up to 3,000 transactions per second in an open, permissionless network while also offering amazing anonymity, trustlessness, and cross-border security. Therefore, as we move towards a future driven by digital finance and decentralized technologies, it stands to reason that a growing forum of investors will continue to gravitate towards platforms like Klever, especially since they are designed to meet all of their DeFi needs in the easiest, most streamlined manner possible."

But nothing concrete really came out of their partnership. It turned out Baidu had a plan of its own.After spending years developing autonomous driving technology,Baidu reportedly held talks with Chinese carmakers in 2020 about making its own electric vehicles. Then in October 2020, Baidu launched trial operations of its self-driving Apollo Robotaxi in Beijing, China. Fast forward a year later,Baidu unveiled itsnew electric robotaxi that can drive without a steering wheel.The new electric vehicle, dubbed the Apollo RT6, comes with a detachable steering wheel and costs 250,000 yuan (about $37,313) to produce, which is 48% less than the production cost of its predecessor car.Baidu said it aims to produce 100,000 Apollo RT6 vehicles over an unspecified period of time. Baidu kicked off its robotaxi business, called Apollo Go, in November 2021, after getting approval from Chinese regulators to charge fees in Beijing.However, a human staff member must still sit in the car. In April, municipal authorities loosened restrictions on whether the staff member had to sit in the driver’s seat, paving the way to fully eliminating the cost of a taxi driver. It remains unclear when the Chinese government would allow robotaxis to charge fares for rides without any human staff in the vehicles. “This massive cost reduction will enable us to deploy tens of thousands of [autonomous driving vehicles] across China,” Robin Li, co-founder and CEO of Baidu, said in a statement. “We are moving towards a future where taking a robotaxi will be half the cost of taking a taxi today.” Founded in 2000 by Eric Xu and Robin Li,Baidu is the largest Chinese language Internet search providerand search engine that enables individuals to obtain information and find what they need.Baidu offers functional online search, Tieba community search, industry-based vertical search, mp3 search, portal channels, and instant messaging services.

Today,Northvolt announced it is partnering withFinnish-Swedish cellulose and paper companyStora Enso and Northvolt partner to develop sustainable wood-based batteriesthat incorporate components produced using lignin-based hard carbon produced with renewable wood sourced from forests in the Nordic region. As part of the joint venture agreement, the two companieswork together on the production of a battery containing an anode made from something called lignin-based hard carbon. An anode is a crucial part of a battery, alongside the cathode and electrolyte. “The aim is to develop the world’s first industrialized battery featuring anode sourced entirely from European raw materials, lowering both the carbon footprint and the cost,” the companies said in a statement. “The joint battery development with Northvolt marks a step on our journey to serve the fast-growing battery market with renewable anode materials made from trees. Our lignin-based hard carbon, Lignode® by Stora Enso, will secure the strategic European supply of anode raw material, serving the sustainable battery needs for applications from mobility to stationary energy storage,” says Johanna Hagelberg, Executive Vice President for Biomaterials at Stora Enso. Stora Enso was formed in 1998 through the merger of the Finnish company Enso Oyj and the Swedish company Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags Aktiebolag (STORA). Both companies bring key components, competence, and expertise to the battery partnership. Stora Enso will provide its lignin-based anode material Lignode, originating from sustainably managed forests, while Northvolt will drive cell design, production process development, and scale-up of the technology. “With this partnership, we are exploring a new source of sustainable raw material and expanding the European battery value chain, while also developing less expensive battery chemistry. It is an exciting demonstration of how our pursuit of a sustainable battery industry goes hand-in-hand with creating a positive impact both on society and cost,” says Emma Nehrenheim, Chief Environmental Officer at Northvolt. Lignin is a plant-derived polymer found in the cell walls of dry-land plants. Trees are composed of 20–30% of lignin, which acts as a natural and strong binder. It is one of the biggest renewable sources of carbon anywhere. Stora Enso’s pilot plant for bio-based carbon materials is located at the Group’s Sunila production site in Finland, where lignin has been industrially produced since 2015. The annual lignin production capacity is 50,000 tonnes, making Stora Enso the largest kraft lignin producer in the world. The Group is also evaluating its first industrial production of Lignode at the Sunila site through a feasibility study. Founded in 2016 by CEO Peter Carlsson andPaolo Cerruti with themission to enable the European transition to a decarbonized future,Northvolt develops sustainable lithium-ion batteries, and recycling to support clean energy. Northvolt industrial partners and customers include ABB, BMW Groupe, Scania, Siemens, Vattenfall, Vestas, and backer, the Volkswagen Group. In addition, theStockholm, Sweden-based tech startup alsoprovides electrification and renewable energy storage designed for lithium-ion battery plants to produce batteries for electric vehicles. Since its inception six years ago, Northvolt has made swift progress on its mission to deliver the world’s greenest lithium-ion battery with a minimal CO2 footprint on the highest ambitions for recycling."

The Google Ventures-backed crypto startup announced it is laying off 25% of its workforce, citing the economic downturn and harsh market conditions. The layoff will affect 150 people within the company. In conjunction with the layoff, Blockchain also announced it shutting down its Argentinian office and canceling the plans to expand in multiple countries. The company informed its staff Thursday that most of the layoffs, about 44%, affect Blockchain.com staff in Argentina while 26% are based in the US and 16% in the United Kingdom. Blockchain.com now becomes the fourth company that got caught up in the fallout of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s collapse, which filed for bankruptcy last week and its foundermissing. Other startups with financial exposure to Three Arrows include Voyager Digital, BlockFi, and crypto lending startup Celsius, which also filed for bankruptcy. Before declaring bankruptcy,Blockchain.com had lent Three Arrows Capital $270 million in crypto. Now the company is expecting to lose that money. As we reported last month,Three Arrows Capital shocked the crypto industrywhen it announced it was unable to meet margin call demands from lenders, causing the leading crypto hedge fund into a crisis that comes as turmoil and credit crunch grip the crypto market.Three Arrows is one of the biggest and most active players in the crypto industry with investments spanning the lending and trading platforms. Meanwhile, the ongoing bloodbath in the cryptocurrency markets continues with no sign of slowing down as investors run for cover due to fear of recession and potential rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. We covered the London-basedBlockchain.com last year after it raised $300 millionin series C funding that put the company at a $5.2 billion post-money valuation. The company raised additional funding earlier this year that increased its valuation to $14 billion. Its investors include Baillie Gifford, American hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, and British tycoon Richard Branson.

2022.7.23,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.7.23,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.7.23,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate. Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.

With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.7.24,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol. Founded in 2020 byDavid Joao Vieira Carvaho, and Monica Oravcova,Naoris Protocol is the Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh for the hyper-connected world.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."

Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

The news of the ban quickly spread across the NFT space causing theNFT Worlds to crash tomore than 70 percent and putting the $75 million NFT project in disarray. Mojang was acquired by Microsoft through Xbox Game Studios (then known as Microsoft Studios).Microsoft has become more aggressive with gaming over the past several years. The tech giant bought the “Minecraft” maker Mojang for $2.5 billionin November 2014. According to Newzoo and other sources, Minecraft is currently ranked as the#1 game in the world. Announcing its upcoming usage guidelines following Minecraft 1.19 update, Mojang said in a blog post that it’s banning NFTs in Minecraft and similar blockchain integration from the game. The announcement has left the Minecraft community divided and caused one of the biggest Minecraft third-party developers to lose its value. TheMinecraft maker explains the reason for the ban, saying: “NFTs are not inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the have-nots.”Mojang also added: “NFTs and other blockchain products work by creating scarcity and exclusion.” It also pointed out that the usage of Minecraft for NFT promotes profiteering which, as per the developers, “is inconsistent with the long-term joy and success of our players.” The Minecraft maker also took to social media to share the upcoming guidelines. In a Twitter post, Minecraft quoted its earlier post: “To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications, nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilized by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset.” Minecraft said that no one will be allowed to buy, sell or trade NFTs that use Minecraft elements once the new usage guidelines come into effect. These also include worlds, skins, personalization items, mods, and more Minecraft-exclusive items. In addition, users will no longer be able to create or buy NFTs featuring Minecraft, nor can any third-party APIs integrate any blockchain technology with the game’s client. TL;DR:""To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our Minecraft client and server applications nor may they be utilized to create NFTs associated with any in-game content…"" — Minecraft (@Minecraft) July 20, 2022  The news is a blow and nail in the coffin of Web3 companies that have already integrated their APIs with Minecraft with the hope of cashing in through the selling of in-game NFTs. Meanwhile, NFT Worldshit back at Mojang saying,“Make no mistake, this is a web2 vs web3 battle.” The NFT startup also vowed tomake its own Minecraft-like game. NFT Worldscalled the decision “a step backwards in innovation”, telling its Discord users that it was trying to “find an alternative outcome.”NFT Worlds also said: “Microsoft, Mojang and Minecraft have signaled they have no regard for creators, builders and players”, NFT Worlds now says it is “diving head first” into developing “a new game and platform based on many of the core mechanics of Minecraft, but with the modernization and active development Minecraft has been missing for years.” https://twitter.com/nftworldsNFT/status/1550526127407452161 Below is a video from Yong Yea with an excellent analysis of the fallout of the new Minecraft NFT ban.  Below is the full statement released by Mojang. “Hello everyone! Recently, we’ve received some feedback from members of the community asking for clarification and transparency regardingMojang Studios and Minecraft’s position on NFTs(non-fungible tokens) and blockchain. While we are in the process of updating ourMinecraft Usage Guidelinesto offer more precise guidance on new technologies, we wanted to take the opportunity to share our view thatintegrations of NFTs with Minecraft are generally not something we will support or allow. Let’s have a closer look! An NFT is a unique, non-editable, digital token that is part of a blockchain and often purchased with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. An NFT can be associated with any form of digital asset such as an MPEG or a GIF, but the most common use case today is digital art like JPEGs. The purchase of an NFT provides the token that states the ownership of the original digital file. Yet, with any digital file, that file can be copied, moved, or even deleted. NFTs and blockchain have also been associated with speculation, where prices are driven up rapidly and as we have recently seen, may fall rapidly. If you’re a player or creator actively involved in the buying, selling, or trading of NFTs that make use of Minecraft (like skins or worlds), we strongly suggest you go through the information below. Otherwise, it’s likely these changes won’t affect you. In our Minecraft Usage Guidelines, we outline how a server owner can charge for access, and that all players should have access to the same functionality. We have these rules to ensure that Minecraft remains a community where everyone has access to the same content. NFTs, however, can create models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our Guidelines and the spirit of Minecraft. To ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our client and server applications, nor may Minecraft in-game content such as worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods, be utilized by blockchain technology to create a scarce digital asset. Our reasons follow. Some companies have recently launched NFT implementations that are associated with Minecraft world files and skin packs. Other examples of how NFTs and blockchain could be utilized with Minecraft include creating Minecraft collectible NFTs, allowing players to earn NFTs through activities performed on a server, or earning Minecraft NFT rewards for activities outside the game. Each of these uses of NFTs and other blockchain technologies creates digital ownership based on scarcity and exclusion, which does not align with Minecraft values of creative inclusion and playing together. NFTs are not inclusive of all our community and create a scenario of the haves and the have-nots. The speculative pricing and investment mentality around NFTs takes the focus away from playing the game and encourages profiteering, which we think is inconsistent with the long-term joy and success of our players. We are also concerned that some third-party NFTs may not be reliable and may end up costing players who buy them. Some third-party NFT implementations are also entirely dependent on blockchain technology and may require an asset manager who might disappear without notice. There have also been instances where NFTs were sold at artificially or fraudulently inflated prices. We recognize that creation inside our game has intrinsic value, and we strive to provide a marketplace where those values can be recognized. As such, to ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience,blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our Minecraft client and server applications nor may they be utilized to create NFTs associated with any in-game content, including worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods.We will also be paying close attention to how blockchain technology evolves over time to ensure that the above principles are withheld and determine whether it will allow for more secure experiences or other practical and inclusive applications in gaming. However, we have no plans of implementing blockchain technology into Minecraft right now. We hope to have more to share with you soon. In the meantime, if you’re interested in reading up on our guidelines, you can find themhere. Stay tuned!“"

The startup immediately resume withdrawals resumed on the same evening in Thailand and later on in other countries, except for transfers from one investment product. But it now appears the crypto exchange is in trouble with authorities after today’s report that Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was working with law enforcement to look into potential losses among the public. The Thailand SEC said in a statement it was asking impacted Zipmex users to submit information via an online forum on how they had been affected by the problems at the platform.A Zipmex spokesperson told Reuters that the company is fully complying with SEC requests and has been actively speaking to government agencies. Zipmex is the latest in a series of companies impacted bythe recent fallout in the crypto industry due to exposure to defaults from now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital. Others include Celsius Network, Voyager Digital, Babel Finance, and others. The Southeast Asia-focused crypto exchange, which operates in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and Australia,disclosed last week it had exposure worth $53 million in crypto lenders, Babel Finance and Celsius. Zipmex said it extended a loan amount of $48 million to Babel, with an additional $5 million to Celsius, which recently for bankruptcy. But anonymous sources put the loan amount to be at $100 million from a high-yielding program known as ZipUp to Babel. A Babel representative denied theclaim.Zipmex said itplans to write off the $5 million loan to Celsius and is in discussion with Babel to evaluate its options to resolve the issue. According to the Thailand SEC, Zipmex currently holds a digital asset exchange and a digital asset broker license.Dr. Akalarp Yimwilai, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Zipmex (Thailand) also said that Zipmex is a digital trading platform licensed by the Ministry of Finance and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Meanwhile, Zipmex said in a Facebook postover the weekend that it was exploring a deal with an “interested party.”"

Fast forward about a decade later,Seedstars has invested in 90 emerging market venture ecosystems in over 30 emerging countries – from Bogota, India, to Lagos, Nigeria, and Karachi, Pakistan. Today, Seedstars announced the launch ofits second seed stage fund Seedstars International Ventures II to invest in 100 seed-stage tech startup companies in the emerging markets. To support this fund,Seedstars said it raised $20 million from notable investors including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Visa Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, and Symbiotics.The fund is expected to reach a total of $30 million. Seedstars’ current portfolio includes 81 companies in over 30 countries, with category-leading investments in all regions including Pakistan e-commerce startup Dastgyr (backers include Veon and SOSV), Saudi Arabian cloud-based point-of-sale and restaurant management system Foodics ( backers include Sequoia and Prosus). Others included Indonesian MyRobin (backers include Accion Venture Lab and Antler), Latin American restaurant CRM OlaClick(LATAM, backers include Meta and Google/Gradient) and Nigerian B2B marketplace Omnibiz (backers include Musha Ventures and LoftyInc Capital), among others. Seedstars’ portfolio founders In a statement,Patricia Sosrodjojo, partner at Seedstars, said:“I think of it as three different levels. The first one is the fact that we’re coming in very early, we’re usually one of the first institutional checks after the angels so we can help catalyze capital. The second is the countries we cover, where the ecosystems is still not that developed yet. And the third one is that we look for business models that can scale up quickly, similar to the normal VC model, but that they would be able to affect a lot of people. We align ourselves with a lot of the ESGs.” Charlie Graham-Brown, Seedstars Partner, comments, “I have no doubt about the abundance of talented founders or the market opportunities, but the challenges can’t be ignored. Our strategy innovates on so many levels to mitigate risk, be it through our country diversification, portfolio construction strategy, value creation platform, or the blended finance structure. We have a unique recipe, an incredible team, and backers in place to build on the success of the first fund and level the playing field for tech entrepreneurs around the world.” Seedstars’ focus on supporting scalable technology companies in emerging markets, solving major societal challenges like access to finance, health, or education, and working closely with entrepreneurs to scale their businesses means that the impact thesis is embedded in the investment thesis. The fund also includes a blended finance component with a first-loss tranche that provides downside protection for investments in the lowest-income markets. Seedstars Partner Patricia Sosrodjojo comments, “Investing and impact don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Our strategy combines these two critical objectives in one and we believe that is what both founders and investors are searching for.”"

The combined company would createmulti-orbit satellites that will potentially expand OneWeb’s constellation big enough tochallenge the likes of Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon.com’s Project Kuiper. In aJuly 25 press release,French satellite operator Eutelsat confirmed the talks after days of rumors about a potential merger between the two companies. “Following recent market rumors, Eutelsat Communications (Euronext Paris: ETL) confirms that it has engaged in discussions with its co-shareholders in OneWeb regarding a potential all-share combination to create a global leader in Connectivity with complementary GEO/LEO activities,” Eutelsat said in a statement. Eutelsat’s statement came after two sources close to the negotiations told Reuters over the weekend that the company was poised to buy OneWeb, which was valued at $3.4 billion in its most recent funding round and in which Eutelsat already has a 23% stake. We covered OneWeb last year after the UK tech space startup secured $550 million in funding from Eutelsat. The new funding gave Eutelsat a.24% equity stake in OneWeb and increased the UK startup funding to $1.9 billion. As we said back then, “the investment from one of the world’s most experienced and largest global operators is a vote of confidence in OneWeb and underscores the arrival of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites into mainstream long-term growth planning for major operators.” “The combined entity would be the first multi-orbit satellite operator offering integrated GEO and LEO solutions and would be uniquely positioned to address a booming ~$16bn (2030) Satellite Connectivity market. OneWeb is one of the two only global LEO networks and has experienced strong momentum over recent months, with service expected to be fully deployed in 2023,”Eutelsat said in a press release. Founded in 2011 by Greg Wyler, its mission is to address the most demanding global connectivity challenges and sudden infrastructure crises.OneWeb is the first to launch a 5G network in space. Itsmission is to enable Internet access for everyone, everywhere. OneWeb is building a communications network with a constellation of Low Earth Orbit satellites that will provide connectivity to billions of people around the world. Its high-speed, low latency network will offer game-changing mobility solutions to industries that rely on global connectivity. OneWeb’s 648 LEO satellite fleet will deliver high-speed, low-latency global connectivity. Its partnership with Eutelsat, a global geostationary satellite operator, will enhance both companies’ commercial potential, leveraging Eutelsat’s established commercial reach to governments and enterprise customers in addition to its strong institutional relationships, recognized technical expertise, and global fleet. OneWeb’s ability to address multiple applications requiring low latency and ubiquity will also allow both companies to explore GEO/LEO configurations for future service integrations and packages."
2022.7.25,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/25/brazilian-unicorn-startup-neon-raises-80-million-quest-become-biggest-bank-brazils-working-class/,"A recent survey by the Locomotiva Institute found that34 million Brazilians do not have access to banking services. Of this number,6.3 million Brazilians do not have a bank account, while the remaining 17.7 million are underbanked. That was not all, Brazilians with bank accounts also faced poor service and high costs associated with traditional banking in the country. It was this frustration that led Pedro Conrade to address this problem with the launch of a digital bank that provides affordable and accessible financial services. In 2016, when he was a 23-year-old business school student,Conrade founded Neon, a challenger bankfocused on improving the lives of working Brazilians. The launch was a resounding success. Fast forward six years later, Neon now has 15 million registered accounts. Just last week, Neonraised $80 million in its first Credit Rights Investment Fund (FIDC) focused on credit cards. This investment increases the total fund to $170 million US in equity, and it is expected to nearly double. “The funding endorses the strength and positive history that we have been building in the management of the credit portfolio over the last few years. Today our credit engine is mature and the FIDC resources will give us the strength to continue expanding our portfolio in a sustainable and balanced way in the med-long term. The focus continues to be on the Brazilian worker, and always with the mission to reduce inequalities by building paths to credit,” says Jamil Marques, CFO of Neon. This is the second fundraising made by Neon in the private credit market this year, given that it had already raised just over US$ 40 million for its private payroll deductible FIDC at the beginning of 2022. The management of the FIDC focused on credit cards was attributed to Empírica, asset management with 12+ years of experience in the market, focused on structured credit and a portfolio of 50+ funds and over US$ 1.5 billion in assets under custodial. “We are excited about this partnership that began in the first months of the year as a one-off investment in another Neon FIDC, focused on private payroll loans. Based on this good experience, we expanded our relationship to take over the management of the credit card fund. The intention is to bring more comfort and security to investors, including ourselves who, via funds of funds managed by us, contributed a total of $20 million US to FIDC Neon. This shows an alignment of interests with the other investors in this fund,” says Giuliano Longo, Managing Partner of Business Expansion at Empírica, adding that the check may increase as the FIDC grows. In addition to Empírica, XP, and BV also led investments in the FIDC.  Neon believes it can create a conscious path to credit with solutions and innovations that can help the customer to obtain credit in a simple and fair way. Neon recently launched the elastic limit, which makes it possible to expand credit for one-off purchases, based on credit assessment. Additionally, the company already offers personal loans, payroll loans, and credit cards without annuity with special conditions. Neon plans to launch new solutions that will help its customers consciously access credit throughout the rest of the year. Neon ended 2021 with a total credit portfolio of US$ 270 billion and the idea is that the FIDC will bring greater flexibility to its growth strategy. The fintech expects to maintain a sustainable expansion of its credit portfolio, which should more than double by the end of 2022. Neon currently has more than 15 million customers. Neon is a Brazilian fintech founded in 2016 whose mission is to unite technology and design to redesign and simplify people’s financial experience, reduce inequalities, showing simpler and fairer financial paths. With more than 15 million customers, including individuals and companies, Neon recently achieved a valuation of $1.6 billion after its series D fundraise, in which the Spanish Bank BBVA invested $300M. Neon’s rapid expansion has been made possible in part by strategic acquisitions such as MEI Fácil, which offers financial services and education to individual micro-entrepreneurs, in 2019; and the purchase of Magliano Invest, which was the first stock brokerage on Bovespa – the Brazil Stock Exchange Index, in 2020. In the same year, Neon strengthened its payroll loan portfolio with the purchase of ConsigaMais+, the main company in the sector, and with the recent acquisition of Biorc, a company that has the license of Credit, Finance and Investment Society (SCFI)."

Alongside Co-Founder Will Hoyer Millar, he has built a company that has so far helped connect over 3,000 unique buyers and 300 unique sellers of all sizes, manufacturing over two million parts. At its core, Geomiq helps solve inefficient, highly fragmented manufacturing systems, helping clients to build robust, localized, and compliant supply chains. As the sector comes under increasing pressure to address ESG issues, gaining greater transparency will help limit environmental harm by addressing issues throughout the manufacturing chain. “We are very pleased to announce our new partnership with Geomiq, a B2B manufacturing platform that is disrupting this historically traditional industry by streamlining their processes,” said François Robinet, Managing Partner at AXA Venture Partners. “Their digital offer is a game changer, as they gather all key players in the value chain under one roof, from quote to delivery. Their approach to Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) plays a critical role in the industry’s future. By sharing the same vision with Sam and Will, we are very confident at AVP we will be at the forefront of the digital revolution within the manufacturing sector. “"

The UK-based challenger bank announced Tuesday it will enter the BNPL space as themarket heats up.The announcement comes just a month after the iPhone giant Apple announcedthe launch of Apple Pay Later as itpushes further into finance. Virgin Money is the latest to join the crowdedBNPL market afterpayments giant PayPal, Klarna, and Affirm. With the looming recession and millions of people struggling to pay their bills,mainstream lenders, in collaboration with credit card companies, are now pushing into the lucrative but sometimes controversial business to get their piece of the pie. According to a report from Reuters,Virgin Money said it will offer a credit card that allows customers to spread repayments over a number of months, “with installment fees added if they repay in nine months or longer.” The Buy now, pay later (BNPL) phenomenon has grown in popularity in recent years as consumers seek alternative methods of financing. BNPL is a new payment option that allows consumers to receive their purchase right away (Buy Now), either online or in-store, and then pay (Pay Later) for their purchase in installments.BNPL is now revolutionizing the customer journey by being seamlessly integrated into e-commerce as a checkout option. So far, BNPL accounts for only a small portion of overall credit card spending. However, with the coronavirus pandemic-fueled e-commerce boom, this alternative model of financing may be poised to disrupt the $8 trillion US payment card industry. As we reported late last month,Klarna announced it was laying off 10% of its workforceas the economic downturn hits buy now, pay later space. Inflation and recession have forced consumers to cut back on non-essential items like clothing to focus on basic needs such as food, healthcare, and energy. The economic downturn has rippled into the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector forcing companies to make tough cost-cutting decisions including hiring freezes and layoffs. Originally known as Virgin Direct, Virgin Money was founded in 1995 by Richard Branson. The bank has over 4 million customers and issues current accounts, mortgages, and credit cards.Branson’s Virgin parent group owns a 47% stake in the bank."

Everything was going well and business was booming. Then after all your toils and perseverance, you woke up one morning and found out that one of the most powerful tech companies in the world has hijacked your company’s name. That’s exactly what happened to Justin Bolognino hissmall VR startup company called META.Bolognino, who goes by JB says he started his startup company 12 years ago to “create multi-sensory live experiences using virtual and augmented reality for events like Coachella.” Then on October 28, 2021, Bolognino said his business came to a screeching halt after Facebook announced it was changing its name to Meta to focus on the metaverse, the concept Facebook described as “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.” Bolognino is now suing Meta Platforms for trademark infringement, and unfair competition. Bolognino’s company is also seeking unspecified monetary damages.A legal scholar said he has a “completely plausible claim” and could prevail. In an interview with CNBC,Bolognino said his business was destroyed after Facebook rebranded itself.“It was surreal. It was like watching a movie,” Bolognino said in an exclusive on-camera interview. “This is not a scenario I ever wanted to have. This is not a scenario I would wish on my worst enemy,” said Bolognino, who’s now suing Facebook’s parent company, Meta Platforms, for trademark infringement and unfair competition. “When Facebook stole the Meta brand from us, it just completely decimated our business.” Jessica Litman,University of Michigan law professor Jessica Litman and co-author of the casebook “Trademarks and Unfair Competition Law: Cases and Materials,” said Bolognino’s company, META, has a “completely plausible claim [against Meta Platforms] and could well prevail.” Meanwhile,Dyan Finguerra-DuCharme, a partner at Pryor Cashman LLP, a law firm representing Bolognino, says she immediately reached out to Facebook’s parent company (Meta) to let the tech giant know it was infringing on her client’s intellectual property rights. “This issue of what’s called reverse confusion, when you’ve got a small player who’s been doing their business for a period of time, and then you get a giant corporate behemoth with sheer arrogance says ‘I’m going to own this mark now and I’m going to do business with this regardless of the fact that you were here before me,’” she told CNBC."

The acquisition took place a few weeks after BlockFi found itself in deep financial trouble following reports of multiplecomplaintsthat customers could not withdraw their fundsdue to the company’s exposure to Three Arrows Capital. In June, Bankman-Fried, his company, andAlameda Research had also given now-bankrupt crypto brokerage firm Voyager Digital a $200 million cash and stablecoin revolving credit facility, and a facility of bitcoin before the company filed for bankruptcy. Then in early July, just a week after the acquisition of BlockFi, FTXfounder and CEOFTX Sam Bankman-Fried saidhe and his companyhave a “few billion” on hand to help struggling crypto companies that could further destabilize the embattled crypto market. His offer has led many to hailBankman-Fried as the savior of the crypto industry. But not so fast. On Friday, bankrupt Voyager Digital accused FTX of making a low-ball rescue offer saying therescue deal proposed by FTX was “a low-ball bid dressed up as a white knight rescue.” Voyager said in a court filing on Friday that the joint proposal made by FTX and Bankman-Fried’s other crypto trading firm Alameda was only “designed to generate publicity for itself rather than value for Voyager’s customers.” Under the FTX proposed rescue plan, Alameda would purchase all of Voyager’s digital assets and digital asset loans, except the loans to bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. With the plan, “Voyager’s customers could then receive some of those funds if they chose to open an account with crypto exchange FTX. Such customers could either withdraw the cash balance immediately or use it to make purchases on FTX’s platform.” “The AlamedaFTX proposal is nothing more than a liquidation of cryptocurrency on a basis that advantages AlamedaFTX,” the documents said. However, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda did not see it that way. In an emailed statement, Bankman-Fried said,“We submitted what we think is a generous proposal – we aren’t taking fees on this, just letting customers get their remaining assets back promptly.” On July 5,Voyager filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionin the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, according to a filing from the company.The filing includes assets of between $1 billion and $10 billion and liabilities in the same range. Voyager was founded in 2017 by established Wall Street and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and veterans who teamed up to bring a better, more transparent, and cost-efficient alternative for trading crypto-assets to the marketplace.Its founders,Gaspard de Dreuzy, Oscar Salazar, Philip Eytan, Serge Kreiker, and Stephen Ehrlich, also have combined decades’ worth of experience from leading organizations like E*TRADE, Uber, TradeIt, and Lightspeed Financial."

Each of these projects will gain special access to several benefits, including mentorship and assistance from DeFi.org’s mentors, liquidity injections, funding for bootstrap expenses, exposure to existing DeFi players and communities, and a featured listing on the official DeFi.org website along with other select venues during launch. One of the selected projects is Ithil, a DeFi solution designed to let users execute complex strategies using personal or borrowed funds across different external protocols in just a few clicks. In addition to providing single-sided APY, it enables users to access leveraged interaction-based one-click investment strategies via its modular structure. Users can also create their own customized investment portfolio employing various risk-diversified strategies within the platform. The next project, reBaked, aims to simplify the deployment process and management of Web3 and DAO ecosystems. As an end-to-end infrastructure solution, reBaked aims to help Web3 ecosystems achieve shared goals by leveraging its pre-built collaboration mechanisms, revenue sharing agreements, growth tools, and governance infrastructure. The platform offers diverse solutions, including a reverse Web3 launchpad, decentralized grant governance and DAO payroll solution, an advanced hackathon platform, and an in-game revenue sharing mechanism for P2E games. Then there’s CURL – a concentrated synthetic liquidity protocol for all layer-2 synthetic assets. The platform merges curve-style liquidity pooling with the feature of issuing universal synths to represent weighted exposure to the underlying synthetic assets. By design, CURL intends to integrate DeFi’s fragmented liquidity, enable anyone to generate a similar layer-2 synth for every underlying layer-1 asset, and deliver a balanced risk-return for its liquidity providers. Finally, there’s Prophet – a decentralized marketplace of automated DeFi investment strategies. The platform aims to lower DeFi’s entry barriers by allowing users to access a range of community-listed investment strategies that would otherwise take hours to build. Anyone can list their strategy on the Prophet marketplace and receive a management fee when other users deploy the strategies."
2022.7.26,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/26/5-nft-platforms-every-sports-fan-know/,"Fan engagement has always been a massive part of sports. This is a large component of the home field advantage, and sports teams have been prioritizing it accordingly. If you’re a sports fan, you’ll want to engage with your favorite teams as much as possible. However, in recent times this has become harder with each individual’s voice being drowned out on social media. This is where fan engagement platforms come in. These platforms help fans and clubs raise their mutual engagement to the next level. Whether it is by participating in real-life events, talking to other fans, or competing with other fans in competitions. These days, fan engagement platforms are blending more and more with the crypto community and relying on NFTs and DAOs to let fans truly influence their favorite teams. Today, we’ll be going over the best fan engagement platforms out there for you to know.  As the first fan-influence platform, Socios enjoys a special place in the fan engagement platform world. Socios is a crypto-based fan engagement platform revolving around fan tokens. These tokens are a kind of crypto asset that you can purchase or earn through the platform to show your support of a certain club. With over 150 partners and millions of users, Socios is one of the indisputable kings of fan engagement platforms What we like the most about Socios is its vast community and successful gamification of fan engagement. If you want to earn tokens or points, you can do so in a variety of ways including: Once you’ve got enough points or tokens, you can redeem them for a variety of different rewards. Some of the most popular are gaining VIP access to a big game, getting free attendance to a meet & greet, and the like. However, even if you’re not a dedicated superfan, there’s something for you in the Socios merch store. One of the best things about Socios is the sheer influence it gives you over your favorite teams. You can vote on binding team polls, allowing you to directly influence your favorite team’s decision-making process. To see what kind of decisions were brought by Socios, you can look here. All in all, Socios is an excellent fan-engagement and influence platform and should be the first one you check out.  Sorare is a blockchain-based fantasy sports game endorsed by countless sports teams and fans worldwide. It has over 280 officially licensed football clubs, as well as all 30 MLB baseball teams. In Sorare, the main point of the game is amassing a virtual team signified by virtual cards (NFTs), then pitting your team against other users. You can collect some really valuable cards this way, for example, Erlin Haalands’ card auctioned for almost $700,000. However, you can get a cheap deck to support your favorite team and it’ll still work just fine, the most expensive cards are primarily bling, rather than power. Read: How to play Sorare. When players pit their teams against each other in weekly tournaments, Sorare looks at their team’s real-life counterparts and assigns them points based on their performance. The overall score includes at least 40 actions such as duels lost, duels won, opportunities created, assists, cards, and more. All in all, Sorare is the best card-based fan engagement platform and is a blast to play if you’re into fantasy sports managers. Fanzee is still an ongoing project, but we had to include it in this list. So far, the platform shows a ton of promise, especially due to its versatility. Where most other platforms on this list focus on one or two assets or games, Fanzee will try to bring much-needed diversity to the space. The platform will have different challenges you can participate similar to Socios, except there will be more of them, and they want to put more emphasis on the “game” part of gamification. This means quizzes, bets, puzzles, and even a team builder similar to Sorare. Fanzee will also implement a Fanz leaderboard where you can see the best fans in each of these categories. Now, outside of being a mashup of Sorare and Socios, Fanzee does have one large unique feature. Rather than migrating a club’s fanbase to a 3rd-party platform for direct interaction, Fanzee will have a fan engagement solution embedded deep within the club’s digital ecosystem, making interactions more organic and meaningful. All in all, we see Fanzee as the platform with the most potential and are looking forward to seeing it fulfilled.  Autograph.io lets fans purchase autographed NFTs of their favorite stars. This ranges from sports stars like Rafael Nadal to celebrities like Tony Hawks. Each of these NFTs is completely unique and comes with the signature of your chosen stars. Some of these are moving autographs where you’ll see, for example, a robot 3D printing a model of the star alongside their signature. Since each one of these cards is a unique NFT, some of them can fetch quite a high price tag, such as this one by Rafael Nadal. If you’re the type to collect baseball cards or the like, for many users, Autograph.io scratches the same itch just in a digital format. There’s even a collector leaderboard where you can proudly display your collection and see how it stacks up against others.  Dapper Labs makes the last spot on this list not because it’s an inferior platform, but because it isn’t exclusively focused on sports. However, it also relies on gamification and NFTs to provide fans with more engagement than ever. These are the makers of Top Shot and ALLDAY, two NFT- based sports games that fans have enjoyed greatly, and have over $1 billion in combined transactions. However, Dapper Labs doesn’t yet provide much in the way of actual engagement through its platform. However, there have been talks about more voting features in the future, which would let holders of a certain team’s cards vote on team decisions. Regardless of if you’re an NBA fan, you should keep your eyes peeled for any new Dapper Labs creations coming out."

The round, which now puts the company at a $1 billion valuation,was led by new investor Pantera Capital with participation from Mayfield, Gaingels, Alchemy Ventures, Redbeard Ventures, Spartan Group, OKG Investments, Polygon, CoinDCX, CoinGecko, We3 syndicate, Rainfall Capital, Broadhaven, EI Ventures, Hardyaka, and Sound Media Ventures, along with previous investors Boost VC and Draper Associates. Unstoppable will use the new capital infusion to fuel product innovation and grow its partnerships in the web3 space as we continue to build a platform for user-owned and portable digital identity.Unstoppable is a registry business similar to Verisign, the owner of .com domain, except the domains are on a blockchain. Unlike traditional .com, domains, blockchain domains aredomain assets on a blockchain that replaces cryptocurrency addresses with human-readable names. Blockchaindomain names also don’t work like traditional domain names via the major web browsers. Users of blockchain domains have to download special software or make changes to their browsers in order to access them. With Unstoppable Domains, users can register for the .zil domain extension, enabling them to create websites that leverage the decentralized storage network, InterPlanetary File System, for data storage. These domain names can also be used to replace crypto addresses, enabling users to use their .zil domain name when receiving crypto payments. We covered Unstoppable a year ago after it announced thesale of its “win.crypto” blockchain domain NFT for a record $100,000. The sale — which occurred on March 3, 2021 — stood alone as the most expensive NFT domain name NFT ever recorded. The purchase of the “win.crypto” blockchain domain highlights the growing interest in the NFT phenomenon beyond digital art. Since its inception four years ago, Unstoppable has made deep inroads into blockchain domains. According to the announcement,the startup says it has registered 2.5 million domains andgenerated more than$80 millionin sales. Meanwhile, the company has been involved in a series of lawsuits in recent months. According to a recent lawsuit filing, the startup said it earned $5 million from selling domains under the .wallet extension. “Unstoppable Domains is rapidly defining a new category of decentralized identity that will change the internet as we know it,” said Paul Veradittakit, Partner at Pantera Capital. “We’re proud to back Matt and the rest of the team who are making this vision a reality.” “For too long, companies have controlled people’s digital identities, and Unstoppable Domains is putting that power back into the hands of people,” saidMatthew Gould, Founder and CEO of Unstoppable Domains. “As the digital economy becomes a larger part of our lives, it’s time for people to own their identity on the internet. We’re thrilled to partner with Pantera and other investors who share our vision of onboarding billions of people onto Web3 through NFT domains that unlock user-owned, private, and portable identities.” Founded in 2018 byBogdan Gusiev, Brad Kam, Braden Pezeshki, and Matthew Gould,Unstoppable Domains is a San Francisco-based company building the universal naming system for the decentralized web. The company is backed by Draper Associates and Boost VC and has received grants from the Ethereum Foundation. Unstoppable also offers NFT domains that give people full ownership and control of their digital identity. The company has registered 2.5 million domains, which people can use to log into more than 150 Web3 applications, replace lengthy crypto wallet addresses on more than 80 wallets and exchanges, create decentralized websites, and build their web3 identity. Unstoppable Domains has built more than 300 partnerships with leading web3 companies like Polygon, Blockchain.com, MoonPay, and more."

By 2050, the number is expected to hit 10 billion which will result in a 70% increase in food demand.With billions of people to feed,there are also challenges of land and water to contend with. The world needs to manage the water consumption needed to grow food. Additionally,as people become more conscious about eating healthy, more and more people now want to grow their own food in a more sustainable way.The solution to this demand must come from groundbreaking innovation and technologies that improve both crop and meat production efficiencies. That’s where today’s startup comes in. EnterVerility,a central Indiana AgTech startup that is focused on disrupting and optimizing breeding and fertility in animal health by leveraging image recognition and proprietary algorithms in the global animal health breeding markets. To further develop its livestock fertility analysis platform, Verility announced today itclosed $3.5 million in a Series A funding roundled by Mountain Group Partners of Nashville, Tennessee, with a previous investment from Purdue Foundry.  Led by co-founder and CEO Liane Hart,Verility has created a global platform called Fertile-EyezTM that provides fertility analysis products that enable livestock producers and breeders to accelerate reproductive performance. It provides accurate, simple, and cost-effective analysis to predict the ovulation phase and sperm quality at the point of care. The company has licensed the intellectual property from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a nonprofit teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School, where it was originally created and validated in humans. Hart said improving sperm analysis and improving ovulation detection for animal breeding are two of the most important ways to meet the critical need for more edible meat protein. She said the conception rate is known to be highly correlated with producer profitability and food sustainability. “The Series A funding will allow us to develop our product for swine producers and breeders in a major segment of production,” she said. “The investment will allow us to reach the point of preparing for commercialization, which we anticipate in late 2023. It’s extremely exciting to have the ability to bring automated mobile breeding technologies into a segment of the animal health industry that normally does not see much innovation.” Verility chief financial officer Brian Kopp said, “We are extremely pleased that more investment is finding its way into animal health innovation to bring more efficiency to animal production. We have a real opportunity to make a significant improvement in animal fertility, an area where more innovation is needed.” Rob Readnour, managing director at Mountain Group Partners, said Verility complements the group’s investment portfolio. Its investment in Verility’s Series A funding round aligns with the group’s overall goals.  “Mountain Group Partners is excited to bring our expertise in animal health to help Verility develop the Fertile-Eyez technology to allow swine producers to be more productive through improved reproductive performance,” he said. “Producers are facing challenges from rising input costs and labor shortages only exasperated by the pandemic. They need innovation like Fertile-Eyez to help them meet the important mission of producing animal protein in a sustainable way.” Hadi Shafiee, a faculty member at the Division of Engineering in Medicine and Renal Division of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said artificial intelligence-assistive tools will play an important role in the path toward transforming traditional agriculture to precision agriculture. “The proprietary, AI-enabled, smartphone-based platform technology that my lab has created has broad applications in precision animal health and breeding,” he said. “This Series A funding will help us to commercialize our first AI-enabled product for accurate, affordable and real-time ovulation prediction in swine.” Verility received $100,000 as one of two winners of the Purdue Ag-Celerator, an agriculture innovation fund, in January 2022. Riley Gibb, director of business development at Purdue Foundry, said the company is a strong example of startups that bring Purdue-supported innovations to the market. Earlier this year,Futurology Life selected Verility as one of its top agriculture technology companies in Indiana. Hart recently participated in Purdue Foundry’s Women in Entrepreneurship Panel and AgriNovus Indiana’s Quadrant event for ag bioscience entrepreneurs."

2022.7.27,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/27/naoris-protocol-gets-11-5m-funding-tokenize-cybersecurity/,"Having just banked $11.5 million in funding, Naoris Protocol says it’s on a mission to scale up the adoption of a decentralized cybersecurity mesh of validator nodes to shore up network defenses, making them stronger as they grow to encompass more devices. The company is backed by a host of investors, including Tim Draper, Holt Xchange, Holdun Family Office, Holdun Opportunity Fund, Brendan Holt Dunn, Expert Dojo, Uniera, SDC Management, Level One Robotics, and a number of unnamed NBA and tennis stars. Naoris Protocol is attempting nothing less than to revolutionize the way network security is implemented in order to build safer information-sharing environments based on a decentralized architecture. With its protocol, network devices will validate each other within a tokenized machine economy in order to eliminate single points of failure. It’s a compelling idea because traditional networks have always become weaker the more they grow. As new devices are added, it creates more endpoints that can potentially be exploited by hackers looking for a way in. Naoris Protocol turns this on its head thanks to its novel consensus mechanism, called Distributed Proof of Security (dPoSec), which runs on a purpose-built, security-focused blockchain that’s able to perform thousands of transactions per second. The blockchain is based on a sharding architecture called Verge Clusters, which provides use-case-specific security and compliance logic that helps to ensure the integrity of all devices and processes running on a network. At the core of Naoris Protocol is the CYBER token, which must be spent to add new machines to the network. The CYBER token is used to monetize trusted cyber security, serving as an incentive for network participants to identify vulnerabilities and secure networks. Within networks that run the Naoris Protocol, participants must hold CYBER tokens to incentivize validators to continuously ensure the trust status of each device. In this way, each new device that’s added to the network goes through an onboarding process that ensures they carry no known risks or vulnerabilities. Once done, that device becomes a cyber trusted validator, helping to validate every other device on the network for trusted behavior. As such, tokenization provides value for network participants to maintain the health of the system, creating an impenetrable cyber secure environment, the company said. Naoris Protocol will launch by the end of the year and believes its unique approach of decentralized security can be customized to various industries, including banking and healthcare, as well as governments and the entire Web3 stack. It’s consistent with modern zero-trust architecture too, while the protocol itself is community-governed and censorship-resistant. Most of all, Naoris Protocol says it’s the most pragmatic solution to cybersecurity and one that can be widely adopted and implemented across Web3 within the next few years, complete with self-healing capabilities and the ability to scale almost indefinitely. “We have reached an important milestone for Naoris Protocol backed by the most visionary VCs both in blockchain and deep tech,” said Naoris Protocol c0-founder and Chief Operating Officer Monica Oravcova. “After an extensive period of research and development activities, we are moving into the next phase of serving our growing customer portfolio in the web2 and web3 space.”"
2022.7.27,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/27/impact-bitcoin-adoption-developing-world/,"There’s no denying that the crypto market has continued to be faced with a lot of bearish pressure over the last half a year or so, as is made evident by the fact that the total capitalization of this space has dipped quite significantly over the above stated time window. However, amidst this sluggishness, there is enough data to suggest that Bitcoin has continued to garner an increasing amount of traction amongst people across the globe. To this point, it is worth noting that the amount of money entering Bitcoin and its various associated investment vehicles (such as ETFs) has continued to increase steadily since the start of 2022. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the use of Bitcoin has surged across smaller, more emerging markets, suggesting that a growing forum of tech-savvy people are beginning to view the digital asset not only as a long-term store of value (SOV) but also as a legitimate medium of exchange. As per a study commissioned by cryptocurrency exchange AAX, the use of Bitcoin across emerging markets — such as Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia — has skyrocketed over the last couple of years, especially beyond being a simple tool for drawing short term gains. For example, in the MENA region and S.E Asia, crypto enthusiasts have been accruing BTC for the purpose of money management, a move they think will allow them to become financially independent. To elaborate, investors across these areas have adopted Bitcoin to preserve the value of their hard-earned savings as well as with the aim of drawing short/long-term profits. Not only that, but they have also used the asset to act as a monetary hedge in an effort to offset potential losses and gains as far as their other investments go. On the other hand, countries located within Africa and S.America have begun transacting in Bitcoin, with empirical data showing that people living in both continents have employed the digital asset to make payments, transfers, and receive funds on a regular basis. As per the above-stated study, over the last 12 months, 52% percent of all individuals living in emerging markets have witnessed a marked increase in Bitcoin usage. To this point, use cases were found to be varied with 44% of people noticing more people using BTC for investment purposes while more than 48% noted a tangible increase in consumers using Bitcoin to facilitate payments and/or transfers. That said, some of the challenges currently impeding the adoption of Bitcoin are the currency’s fluctuating value, security risks (such as those related to third-party thefts), and legislative uncertainty surrounding the asset, amongst other things. Most of these issues seem to be rooted in BTCs inherent autonomy which is part of its basic design framework. As Bitcoin’s use continues to grow, data suggests that the cryptocurrency can help ease many pain points currently affecting the global economy — such as expensive and time-consuming domestic and international fund transfers, and lack of access to high-quality financial services across developing areas. Furthermore, with the growth of layer 2 solutions such as Stacks, RSK, Lightning Network (LN), it has become possible to expand Bitcoin’s core use cases. For example, Stacks is an open-source network of decentralized apps and smart contracts built on the Bitcoin network allowing users of the digital currency to not only access the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem but also improve its overall scalability, transaction throughput capacity, etc. Use cases aside, Bitcoin’s worth as an investment tool, borderless store of value, or even a borderless exchange of value is still hindered by the fact that many people lack knowledge about the crypto market, thinking of it only in terms of a short term profit making vehicle. However, once people go beyond the immediate hype and understand the core features underlying the asset and its associated blockchain technology, there is a lot more that can be done using cryptocurrency. Therefore, moving forward, experts believe that it is essential for people to filter out the misinformation surrounding Bitcoin and do their own research, especially when it comes to understanding how bitcoin works, and the risks associated with it."

Onto currently offers 18 models, with subscriptions starting from £489 per month. The shift from gas to electric has continued at an accelerated. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders,registrations of plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles are now about 10.7% of the overall market share in the U.K. in 2020,up from 6.6% in 2019. A recent EY Consumer Index study also showed that 49% of car buyers want an electric vehicle as their next car, with upfront costs and concerns about charging seen as the most significant barriers for first-time EV buyers. With almost 90% of our customers preferring the convenience of an all-inclusive package that covers everything – even public charging – our unique proposition addresses these customers’ needs with a choice of 18 car models. Onto takes the hassle and effort out of getting an EV. We believe that making it simple and easy to get an electric car is essential to building a sustainable future. The innovative business model enables people to subscribe to an electric car on a monthly contract. The subscriptions are inclusive of public charging, insurance, and breakdown cover, without any upfront deposit or long-term commitment. Onto is disrupting the traditional ownership models by offering consumers a truly flexible subscription alternative. Presently, the UK’s leading car subscription service, Onto will also use the investment to launch into Germany in 2023 as it looks to accelerate electric car adoption in mainland Europe, and secure its position as the go-to brand for those looking to make the switch to electric. The company already has an office in Germany and welcomed their newly appointed Managing Director of Germany, Joerg Feldheim. Having worked in leadership roles in the automotive industry for over two decades, Joerg brings extensive international startup, management, and transformation experience to drive the company’s expansion. Onto’s monthly subscription service includes 750 miles per month, insurance, servicing and maintenance, and free public charging at more than 12,500 points via its UK network of charging partners – Shell Recharge, BP Pulse, InstaVolt, and Tesla Supercharger. Jolly said: “This funding round is a huge milestone for Onto as it sets us off on our journey to Europe. Germany, a nation with an incredible automotive history as Europe’s biggest car-producing country, is a market with huge potential and a great appetite for electric cars. We’re excited to offer something different. Wian Pieterse, Managing Director, Fintech at Legal & General, said, “At Legal & General we’re committed to playing our part in tackling the climate crisis and investing with purpose into companies that do good. Onto is an exciting example of this; an ambitious company with a talented management team that will play a vital role in accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. We expect to see increasing demand for subscription models that not only pave the way towards a sustainable way of living but also meet the needs of those who don’t want to tie up valuable savings or incur a loan to buy a car. “Onto has grown rapidly over the last four years, and we’re looking forward to working with the team to help the business scale and expand into new markets, all while investing to benefit the future of our society.”"

Now, an unknown Vietnamese carmakerwants to do the same with plans to sellits electric SUVs in the United States. VinFast is a new Vietnamese electric vehicle tech startup that is trying to make its push into the US market.VinFast is a subsidiary ofVingroup, Vietnam’s largest conglomerate founded by Vietnam’s richest man Phạm Nhật Vượng. In December 2020, Vượng announced that VinFast would develop an electric vehicle and export it to the U.S. by 2021. Vuong pledged $2 billion of his own money to make the improbable feat happen. In November,VinFast unveiled two electric crossovers designed by Italy’s Pininfarina called the VF e35 and VF e36. Fast forward a few months later, VinFast is now launching in the United States hoping to take on giants like Tesla.

The 5-year-old startup has partnered with leading automotive industry giants, including LG Chem, Gotion, Pininfarina, and ZF. Besides, VinFast’s team consists of alumni from several top automakers, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota, Hyundai, Porsche, Jaguar-Land Rover, Volkswagen, among others. That’s not all. VinFast has much bigger ambitions.Vinfast Global CEO Michael Lohscheller said in a statement,“We want to become a global brand and if you want to become a global brand, you have to come to the US.” Phạm Nhật Vượng, who made his first fortune in dried ramen noodles, is a Vietnamese property developer and Vietnam’s first billionaire and richest person. He attended the Hanoi University of Mining and Geology before going to Russia to study at the Moscow Geological Prospecting Institute. He returned back to Vietnam to start the Vingroup. We covered VinGroup last year afterthe company reported it was seeking to raise $1 billion in funding from BlackRock and Qatar’s sovereign fund for its electric cars. Founded 29 years ago onAugust 8, 1993, Vingroupfocuses on technology, industry, real estate development, retail, and services ranging from healthcare to hospitality. Four years ago, Vượng decided to start building and selling cars through the company’s automotive group called VinFast."

As part of the plan, which is still in preliminary stages,the two companies will work together to produce about 10,000 trucks “within a few years,” according to a news release. The announcement comes at a time when investors are pouring billions of dollars into tech startups developing autonomous technology aiming to take an early lead in the future of mobility.Pony.ai recently partnered with Toyotato accelerate the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles. With this announcement, Pony.ai now joinsTuSimple,a San Diego-based autonomous trucking unicorn startup andthe world’s first company to complete more than 550 miles of fully driverless truck driving on public roads without a human driver behind the wheel. The trucks are expected to come with “Level 4” autonomous driving technology, which would allow full self-driving on highways and urban roads, according to Pony.ai. “L4″ is part of an industry classification system that designates full self-driving under specific conditions. Meanwhile, under current transportation rules in China, robotrucks are not allowed to operate fully autonomously. Founded in 2016 byJames Peng and Tiancheng Lou,the Fremont, California, and Beijing, China-based Pony develops artificial intelligence solutions in the field of robotics.Pony.ai is the leading autonomous driving technology company in China, with a mission to revolutionize the future of transportation by building the safest and most reliable solution for autonomous mobility.Pony.ai has raised roughly $300 million as of April 2019 from renowned investors including Sequoia Capital China, IDG Capital, among others, making it the most valuable autonomous driving startup in China. Meanwhile, Pony.ai also added that small-scale deliveries are set to begin this year and next, with mass production due to start in 2024.CitingPony.ai said it only has testing permits in Beijing and Guangzhou for autonomous trucks. But the company said it expects to operate L4 trucks in China as regulations develop."

Startup funding reached $120 billion, the lowest amount recorded for a single quarter since the beginning of 2021. Second-quarter funding also fell 26% quarter over quarter from $162 billion in the first quarter and 27% year over year from $165 billion in the second quarter of 2021, according to data from Crunchbase. Now, one venture capital firm has come to the rescue. Today,Portage Ventures, the venture capital arm of Sagard, announced it is seekingto raise up to $1 billion for its new fund to invest in late-stage fintech startups. In a press release, the firm said it israising a structured equity fund that will focus on financing late-stage startups in the financial technology sector that are reluctant to take a hit in their valuation amid the market downturn. In an interview with Reuters,Portage co-founder and CEOAdam Feleskysaid the firm plans to raise about$1 billion for the so-called structured equity fund, investing in securities that combine debt and equity features and do not require startups to lock in a valuation as with traditional equity fundraising. “We’re a liquidity provider in environments that otherwise would be quite difficult,” Felesky said. Over the years, many tech startupshave been reluctant to raise funding through the traditional route during the financial downturn for fear of being forced to accept a lower valuation than their previous funding round. “We see many great companies that are looking for the right partner. Portage’s expertise and network in fintech and financial services are real differentiators as businesses look to navigate this market. We will deliver more than just capital,” said Devon Kirk. Daniel Ballen has spent nearly twenty years investing in private equity, structured equity and special situations focused on the financial services, fintech and real estate technology sectors. Prior to Portage, he served as a Portfolio Manager at PIMCO, based in New York, where he led a team focused on structured equity and private equity investments in both North America and Europe for the firm’s alternatives franchise. Daniel has also served on the investment teams of Bain Capital and Pine Brook Partners, partnering with growing businesses across the fintech and financials landscape. “In this market environment, we’re seeing accelerated demand for flexible capital solutions as entrepreneurs and shareholders look to continue the strong growth trajectory of their business,” said Daniel Ballen. Portage believes PCS’ strategy is well-positioned to meet the demand for capital across all cycles in both public and private markets, whether for organic growth, M&A, or recapitalizations. PCS will leverage Portage’s existing platform, one of the largest global fintech specialist investment firms with over $3 billion in AUM, and benefit from its deep fintech experience, established sourcing network and proven value-creation expertise. “Daniel and Devon bring extensive sourcing and transaction execution experience across asset classes,” said Adam Felesky, Co-Founder and CEO of Portage. “Together, we can expand our efforts to partner with later stage visionary fintech entrepreneurs providing both capital and a value creation network that supports them throughout the life of their business.” “Portage is building a global platform investing in what we view as the top financial services leaders across the globe,” said Paul Desmarais III, Chairman and CEO of Sagard. “With talented professionals such as Daniel and Devon, we are excited to support companies from early-stage to growth.”"

We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.” Meta also said it plans to invest $10 billion on its metaverse to reflect the company’s new vision. At the time, Meta said itplansto hire 10,000 people in the European Union to build a “metaverse.” Zuckerberg added that metaverse is a majorinvestment for the company and plays a vital role for the company going forward. Fast forward almost a year after the rebrand,the company has already lost about $0.5 trillion in market capitalization. That’s not all. Meta’s VR division Reality Labs was also hemorrhaging cash. In 2021, the unit lost about $10.2 billion, with losses accelerating.Reality Labs’ losses also ballooned to $3.3 billion by the fourth quarter of 2021.Then in April of this year,Reality Labs posted an operating loss of $2.96 billion on $695 million in revenues forQ1’22. “We do expect reality labs operating loss to increase meaningfully in 2022, and that’s incorporated into our outlook,” CFO Dave Wehner told analysts during the earnings call. Now, the Q2 numbers are in and Meta doesn’t appear to be faring well. According to CNBC,Meta lost another $2.81 billion on $452 million in revenue from Reality Lab as the company continues to pursue its metaverse ambitions. “The substantial sum is the latest sign that CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta continue to spend heavily to pivot the social media giant to developing virtual reality and augmented reality products and the so-called metaverse,” CNBC said.  Early this year,Meta also revealed it lost 500,000 daily users. That was not all. The company also reported a declined profit.Zuckerberg blamed the user decline on TikTok, the short video platform we discussed above. Zuckerberg said the Facebook users’ decline was partly due to the boom in popularity of the competitor platform TikTok. The blame game didn’t stop there. Zuckerberg also blamed the woes on a combination of other factors, including privacy changes to Apple’s iOS and economic challenges.The company said the lower-than-expected growth was due to inflation as well as supply chain issues impacting advertisers’ budgets. Meanwhile, some Facebookdetractors see this as good news. In a piece titled, “Zuckerberg Has Burned $500 Billion Turning Facebook to Meta,” New York Magazine,Kevin Dugan opined that we may be witnessing the early days of the fall of Zuckustus, a jab at Zukerberg and a reference toFormer Roman emperor Caesar Augustus. Duganwrites: “We may be witnessing the early days of the fall of Zuckustus. Facebook’s once unbeatable ad-tracking system — the engine that made it a more than $1 trillion company — has effectively been neutralized by the likes of Apple, which allows users to block the company’s trackers. (Google is set to start phasing in similar protections to its users over the next two years.)” Dugan is not alone. Mutahar, aYouTuber, also shared his views and talked about what every Facebook hater has been wishing for a long time–“Facebook Is Finally Dying.” For the first time in about a decade,Meta has now fallen out of the top ten largest companies in the world by market capitalization."
2022.7.28,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/28/alibaba-founder-jack-ma-plans-give-control-chinas-fintech-giant-ant-group/,"Jack Ma, Chinese billionaire and founder of Alibaba, plans to give up control of financial technology giant Ant Group Co in an effort to move away from affiliate Alibaba Group Holding “after more than a year of extraordinary pressure from Chinese regulators,” the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. The Journal added that Ant had informed officials of Ma’s intention as the firm prepares to become a financial holding company, regulated by China’s central bank. Tensions between Ma and the Chinese Communist Party escalated last year after the billionairecriticized Chinese regulators andChina’s banking system during a conference in October 2020, saying it was run by a “pawnshop” mentality. In recent years, the Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba, has been subjected to sweeping Chinese government regulations and restructuring. In later 2020, Ant’s $37 billion initial public offering (IPO) was derailed by the country’s regulators. With Ma giving up control, that could revive Ant’s IPO and put it back on track. Chinese billionaire Jack Ma plans to give up control of Ant Group Co “to appease regulators following a lengthy crackdown,” Bloomberg news agency reported on Thursday. Ma currently doesn’t hold any titles at the Ant Group but controls 50.52% of voting rights in the company.He could transfer some of his voting power to other Ant officials. In 2021, Reuters reported that Ant was exploring options for Ma to divest his stake in the fintech giant and give up control. Ant and Alibaba did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Jack Ma founded Alibaba in April 199. The former English teacher stepped down on his 55th birthday after amassing a $41.8 billion fortune — a trove surpassed in Asia only by India’s Mukesh Ambani, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The persevering and resilient Ma overcame many obstacles and challenges to become one of China’s richest men. Ma received more than a dozen rejections — including from KFC — before being hired as an English teacher. Ma applied ten times to Harvard Business School (HBS) and got rejected."
2022.7.29,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/07/29/winners-losers-crypto-bear-market-according-new-dappradar-report/,"The crypto market is here and no one knows how long it’s going to last. After many years of sugar-high growth fueled by money printing by the world’s central banks, the global crypto market is slowly cooling down. Overall, this may actually be healthy for the global crypto market and a winnowing time toseparate the chaff from the grain. This crypto winter isalso reminiscent ofthe dot-com bust of early 2000 when some companies with shaky foundations went bankrupt and some were acquired for pennies on a dollar. At the same time, some great companies founded during the bust came out stronger and still survive to this day. Some great examples are Amazon and eBay. Unfortunately, the ongoingcrypto bear market may be worse than the dot-com bust of 2000 due to a perfect storm and convergence of several global macro events such as inflation, recession, the Russia-Ukraine war, and trillions of dollars printed by the global central banks. The question becomes: Which startups will survive the ongoing crypto market? To answer this question, we turn to DappRadar, a firm thatprovides a global app store for decentralized applications (Dapps). The firm just came out with a new research report aboutthe winners and losers of the crypto bear market.   The report revealed that the real winners during the bear market have been blockchain games which grew by close to 10% since Q1. Despite the severe crypto crash caused by Terra, investors remain bullish as the number of investments into blockchain games and metaverse projects has remained constant quarter-over-quarter, with $2.5 billion invested in both Q1 and Q2. June recorded the lowest per month investment with only $500 million, the report confirmed. Overall, the report shows that market activity remains steady, reporting only a slight decrease in average UAW activity QoQ, which declined by 12%. Year-over-Year numbers paint a much more optimistic outlook as we have an overall increase of 62% in UAW activity. “We think that blockchain gaming is going to be key in the next two or three years and is going to bring at least 100 million new users into crypto, for one simple reason, they connect NFTs and DeFi. With all three combined, blockchain gaming, NFTs, and DeFi you will see something genuinely new and exciting,” said DappRadar’s CEO Skirmantas Januskas. Users’ wallet (UAW) activity has fallen by only 7% since Q1, indicating that people continue to engage with blockchain dapps at a more or less the same rate as before the Terra incident. At the same time, the amount of game-related NFT transactions has decreased by 51% since Q1, and the sales volume dropped by 82%. In contrast, since last quarter the number of transactions have shrunk by close to 12% for all NFTs they declined by 15% for DeFi. The average loss in TVL among all the blockchains has been a whopping 68%. Some outliers like Harmony lost 76% of its TVL due to the Harmony bridge hack. With market sentiment already bleak, and with growing user distrust amid the Terra debacle, this could spell the end for the chain. Only time will tell. Many smaller chains paint a more uplifting picture on the other end of the spectrum. Solana grew by 322% last year, while Fantom increased by 455%. Despite being 80% down from its all-time high value, Avalanche is still 1329% up from last year. Solana success is largely down to the fact it attracted many NFTs and game developers mainly due to its cheaper transaction costs and faster processing speeds compared to its rivals. Metaverse-related NFT projects are a beacon of hope as they reported an overall increase in trading volume and transaction count, up by 97% and 27%, respectively. And despite the previously mentioned setback in NFTs, the global interest in NFTs remains strong. While NFT trading volume and transaction count has dropped by a third since Q1, interest in regions like North America, Oceania, and parts of Europe remains high, with Axie Infinity the top searched NFT collection in 112 countries. The most NFT-curious country was Singapore, with 18,717 searches and Hong Kong with 15,213. North America comes third and fifth, Canada with 12,358 and 10,677 searches in the US. In terms of collections, Decentraland remains the most popular in North America, while Central and South American countries favor Axie Infinity, except Chile, which prefers Sandbox. In France, Italy, and Switzerland, as with many football fans in Europe, Sorare is very popular. While Austria, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, and Lichtenstein tend to favor Decentraland. Founded in 2018, DappRadar is The World’s Dapp Store: a global decentralized applications (dapps) store, which makes it easy for its base of more than 1 million users per month to track, analyze, and discover dapp activity via its online platform. The platform currently hosts more than 10,000 dapps from across 30+ protocols and offers a plethora of consumer-friendly tools, including comprehensive NFT valuation, portfolio management, and daily industry-leading, actionable insight."

The investigation started after Zipmex temporarily suspended withdrawals for thousands of its customers but later resumed withdrawals on the same evening. But it was a little too late. Today,Zipmex announced it had filed for bankruptcy protection in Singapore, becoming the latest casualty of the global downturn in digital currencies and exposure to the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital. Zipmex’s trouble with Thailand’s authorities started on July 20 when it froze crypto withdrawals for its users. The startup immediately resume withdrawals resumed on the same evening in Thailand and later on in other countries, except for transfers from one investment product. As we reported on Monday,The Southeast Asia-focused crypto exchange, which operates in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and Australia,disclosed last week it had exposure worth $53 million in crypto lenders, Babel Finance, and Celsius. Zipmex said it extended a loan amount of $48 million to Babel, with an additional $5 million to Celsius, which recently for bankruptcy. But anonymous sources put the loan amount to be at $100 million from a high-yielding program known as ZipUp to Babel. A Babel representative denied theclaim.Zipmex said itplans to write off the $5 million loan to Celsius and is in discussion with Babel to evaluate its options to resolve the issue. According to the Thailand SEC, Zipmex currently holds a digital asset exchange and a digital asset broker license.Dr. Akalarp Yimwilai, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Zipmex (Thailand) also said that Zipmex is a digital trading platform licensed by the Ministry of Finance and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Two days ago, Zipmex said itssolicitors submitted five applications on July 22 seeking moratoriums to prohibit legal proceedings against Zipmex for up to six months. But under Singapore law, such a filing grants companies an automatic moratorium for 30 days, or until a Singapore Court makes a decision on the application, whichever is earlier. Meanwhile, Zipmex said in a Facebook postover the weekend that it was exploring a deal with an “interested party.”"
2022.7.30,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.7.30,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.7.30,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

2022.7.31,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.7.31,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.7.31,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness.

The world’s largest NFT marketplace also saw the sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)on the Ethereum blockchain network fell in June to $700 million, down from $2.6 billion in May and a far cry from January’s peak of nearly $5 billion. But while some have pronounced thepremature death of the nonfungible tokens (NFTs), the sector continues to attract investments from big tech companies and new investors even as tech moguls and celebrities flock to the space. Venture capital firms also see this period as a time to invest in promising tech startups with the potential to get huge returns when the recession is over. One of these startups is OneOf, a green Web3 company and provider of sustainable NFT marketplace foriconic musicians, athletes, and brands. Today,OneOf announced it has raised over $8 million in a strategic round to accelerate the development of its environmentally sustainable NFT marketplace and support its growth in the music, sports, and brand verticals.The round, which brings OneOf’s total funding to-date to over $72 million, was backed by investors including Amex Ventures, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation Fund, Snow Hill Ventures, Sangha Capital, Chain Link Crypto Fund, and others. Existing investors include famed environmentalist and VC Bill Tai’s Actai Unicorn Fund, Galaxy Digital, Nima Capital, Sangha Capital, Recharge Capital, Andromeda Capital, Sanctor Capital, Tezos Foundation, and others. Founded in 2021 by technologist and entrepreneur Lin Dai (CEO), digital media executive Joshua James (COO), and music industry veteran Adam Fell (CSO), OneOf is a new green NFT platform deeply committed to a sustainable and inclusive blockchain future. OneOf’s platform supports NFTs on multiple energy-efficient blockchains, connecting fans and collectors to iconic musicians, athletes, and brands. The startup said it aims to bring the next 100 million non-crypto-native fans into Web3 by removing the technical frictions and allowing fans to pay for their NFTs with credit/debit cards as well as major cryptocurrencies. Minting an NFT on OneOf’s platform uses up to 2 million times less energy than proof-of-work networks, and for its users, purchasing NFTs costs $0 in blockchain gas fees. Iconic musicians, athletes, and brands (such as Doja Cat, The Notorious B.I.G, Wayne Gretzky, Muhammad Ali, Grammys, Warner Music Group, iHeart Media, Duke Basketball, Sports Illustrated, Anheuser-Busch and Gatorade) partner with OneOf to explore ways to bring green and sustainable NFTs to millions of non-crypto native fans worldwide. “We are excited and humbled by the belief and overwhelming support from our new and existing investors and partners to continue executing towards our mission of bringing the next 100M users into the NFT and blockchain space,” said Lin Dai, CEO of OneOf. “As the Web3 market matures and consolidates, we see great opportunities in creating new commerce models, enabling creators of all shapes and sizes, from the biggest global brands to the newest independent artists, to unlock the real world potentials of this new technology.” “A growing number of creators and consumer brands are experimenting with NFTs leading to the rise of a new spend category, new business ideas, and new loyalty and membership models,” said Margaret Lim, Managing Director of Amex Ventures. “We believe that the investment in OneOf will help American Express stay close to the developments in NFT-powered commerce and lead to the development of new customer engagement models for our Card Members.” OneOf is launching a set of NFTs accessible to American Express Card Members as part of an event hosted by American Express.

2022.8.1,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/01/israeli-robotics-startup-cogniteam-partners-aaeon-develop-ready-build-robotic-hardware/,"Creating robots is hard and challenging.Most roboticists will tell you that it took years before the last robot they built or programmed was any good at performing a specific task.So to avoid reinventing the wheels, most robotic companies typically begin with the open-source Robotic Operating System (ROS). However, it didn’t take long before these companies are bottlenecked by ROS limitations. The generic nature of open-source resources lacks the complex layers needed to tackle real-world robotic challenges. That’s whereCogniteamcomes in, an Israeli robotics tech startup and a provider of software solutions for autonomous robots. The company’s focus is on the area of autonomy control for robotics and interactive simulations. Cogniteam hasbeen developing artificial intelligence for robots for over ten years.We first covered Cogniteam in 2021 after the startupunveiled its Nimbus operating system, a cloud-based drag-and-drop platform for robotics development that promises to cut time to market by 80% for new robotics programs. Then in May, Cogniteam raised $5.6 million in Series A funding to enhance its low-code AI robotics platform Nimbus. Since then, the teamCogniteam has been pushing the boundaries and building new partnerships. Today,Cogniteam announced it has teamed up with a leading designer and manufacturer of industrial IoT and Edge AI solutions AAEON to develop ready-to-build robotic hardware. The partnership will enablecompanies to quickly develop and deploy advanced GPS, light, and other sensors using field-tested software solutions. In addition, companies who recognize a new market demand can immediately choose the AAEON system, device, or hardware that’s right for them and know that it’s fully supported with the Nimbus no-code integration. Commenting on the partnership,Cogniteam co-founder and CEODr. Yehuda Elmaliah said: “Removing the burden of robotic integrations, AAEON has developed robotics hardware that is ready for the Nimbus drag and drop platform. “Developers can choose the quality AAEON hardware that’s right for them and significantly cut development time.” Today, developing and deploying a robot is time and resource intensive. From the moment a decision is made to build the robot until it is actually deployed can often take years. By the time it is used for its initial purpose, the technology risks already being out of date. In response, AAEON partnered with Cogniteam to develop hardware systems that come with various foundational capabilities- all of which are pre-integrated with Nimbus. Without this key advantage, operators lack cloud-connected capabilities, which allow for over-the-air updates, monitoring, insights, and operational insights. Founded in 2007 byCEO Dr. Yehuda Elmaliah andNachum Kaminka,Nimbus offers pre-developed drivers and software packages in a drag n’ drop environment, making it easy to incorporate advanced sensors and complicated features. It also integrates with the open-source Robotic Operating System (ROS) and other 3rd party resources. Since its launch, Cogniteam’s Nimbus has improved integration and widespread adoption of ROS and NVIDIA Jetson software packages. Developers pick from a catalog of algorithms, AI, process control, spatial recognition, and more. The robot can then be tested in a simulated environment to understand how the robot will handle various scenarios before it ever leaves the production floor. “We are honored to have AAEON offer parts that are Nimbus enabled, allowing rapid uptime by syncing with a virtual environment,” said Dr. Yehuda Elmaliah, Co-founder and CEO of Cogniteam. “In a few clicks, developers benefit from a system that’s already familiar with AAEON’s hardware specifications and abilities. Developers can choose off-the-shelf parts and significantly cut development time.” Moving the burden of integration from individual organizations to a centralized platform gives robot operators valuable analytics, fleet management capabilities, OTA updates, remote control features, and more. “This integration allows anyone to access today’s most advanced capabilities using pre-integrated AAEON components,” said Owen Wei, Marketing and BD Manager at AAEON. “Adding a cloud layer to a robot’s design keeps it up to date with continuous communication to the home base.” Integration demands will only increase as edge devices begin carrying greater processing power and more advanced capabilities. Robots and components that are designed for cloud connectivity integrations benefit from a longer life, thanks to the ability for features to be added over time. Outfitting robots with tools for modern activities allows them to remain in the field longer without the risk of becoming obsolete. Cogniteam co-founder and CEO Dr. Yehuda Elmaliah"

But there is a bigger problem facing the entire tech sector Last month, Tesla let go of more than 200 employees from its autopilot unit. The electric car giant also closed its San Mateo, California office. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also added that the company would lay off around 3.5% of Tesla’s overall workforce, adding the actual amount was “not super material.” Tesla is not alone.Coinbase laid off 1,100 employees, about 20 percent of its total workforce as tech companies prepare for a recession and crypto winter. The crypto exchange company also went as faras rescinding job offers from new hires. According to the latest tally fromCrunchBase,a platform for finding business information about private and public companies, more than 32,000 tech employees have been laid off as of July.More tech companies are also planning to trim their workforces to counter market challenges amid the global economic downturn. The mass layoff has also spread to big tech companies like Amazon and Facebook. Last week, Shopify also joined the ranks of tech companies laying off employees. The Canada-based company said that it was cutting 10% of its workforce. During its quarterly earnings call last Thursday,Amazon said it let go of 100,000 employees in the last three months, joining Netflix and Google in a hiring slowdown.The retail giant said it overstaffed after ramping up during the pandemic and needed to cut back. Meanwhile,LinkedIn Principal Economist Guy Berger said the ongoing tech layoffs and hiring freezes stems from a so-called boomerang effect. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Berger said: “Tech just kept hiring, just kept rising and rising and rising, at least to the end of last year, and now it’s coming down much faster,” he said. “I would say it’s kind of like a boomerang in that it went up faster and is coming down more sharply. I think this is because to some extent the sector really overextended itself towards the tail-end of the bull run, and now it’s the epicenter for pulling back the fastest.” Below is a list of notable US-based tech companies that have laid off employees so far this year."

MicroStrategy’s president, Phong Le, will become the company’s new CEO. Saylor founded MicroStrategy in 1989 with his friend Sanju Bansal as a software company with a focus on analytics software. The company was at one time famous for its business intelligence software before it later becomes a bitcoin investment company. Since its inception, Saylor has been in the role of CEO and later took the company public in 1998. In a statement, Saylor said: “I believe that splitting the roles of Chairman and CEO will enable us to better pursue our two corporate strategies of acquiring and holding bitcoin and growing our enterprise analytics software business. As Executive Chairman I will be able to focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy and related bitcoin advocacy initiatives, while Phong will be empowered as CEO to manage overall corporate operations.” The announcement comes as the company announces its second-quarter earnings, in which its total revenues dropped by 2.6% compared to a year ago. There’s no indication that Saylor’s investment in bitcoin led to him stepping down from his role as the CEO. “As Executive Chairman, Mr. Saylor will focus primarily on innovation and long-term corporate strategy, while continuing to provide oversight of the Company’s bitcoin acquisition strategy as head of the Board’s Investments Committee,the company said in a press release. “I’m honored and excited to continue leading this truly innovative organization, as President & CEO. Our people and our brand carry incredible momentum. I would like to reinforce our commitment to our customers, shareholders, partners and employees, and I look forward to leading the organization for the long-term health and growth of our enterprise software and bitcoin acquisition strategies,” Le said. Late last month,Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy doubled down on Bitcoin.Having invested billions in the world’s most popular cryptocurrency,Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy announced it purchased an additional 480 bitcoins for ~$10.0 million at an average price of ~$20,817 per #bitcoin. TheVirginia-based business intelligence software MicroStrategy nowholds approx. 129,699 bitcoins, which were acquired for a total of approx. $3.98 billion at an average price of ~$30,664 per bitcoin. InMarch 2021, Saylor told his fans in an infamous video to mortgage their homes and buy bitcoins. Since then, bitcoin has lost more than half of its value. “Once you know how it all ends, the only use of time is…how do I buy more bitcoin? But take all your money and buy bitcoin. Then take all your time, figure out how to borrow more money to buy more bitcoin. Then take all your time and figure out what you can sell to buy bitcoin. And if you absolutely love the thing, that you don’t want to sell it, go mortgage your house and buy bitcoin with it. And if you’ve got a business that you love because your family works for the business and it’s in your family for 37 years, and you can’t bear to sell it, mortgage it, finance it, and convert the proceeds into the hardest money on earth, which is bitcoin,”Saylor told the host.

2022.8.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/02/5g-really-worth-buy-5g-phone-now-wait/,"If you are a regular audience of this platform, you’ve probably read our article about the conspiracy theory and erroneous claim that 5G networking equipment weakens the immune system. That claim has since been debunked. Over the years, the development of fifth-generation (5G) networks sparked anticipation across the globe.In this piece, we’re going to discuss whether a 5G investment is really worth it and if should you buy a 5G phone now or wait. But, with rollout slower than initially forecast, whether-or-not 5G is all service providers hoped it would be is being thrown into question. Today, Hamish White, CEO of telecom solution provider Mobilise discusses whether 5G is really worth the investment. Compared to 4G networks, 5G offers far reduced latency to facilitate faster upload speeds. While it doesn’t completely eradicate 4G’s capacity challenge, it offers much greater bandwidth. Up to one million devices can connect per square kilometer, providing a more reliable service in densely populated and high-traffic areas. 5G subscriptions are predicted to jump to 1.3 billion by the end of 2022, compared to 540 million at the end of 2021, research from telecommunications analyst Omdia has found. Offering 5G networks puts operators in a good stance compared to their competition, as faster data speed becomes more important for consumers. In fact, the Five ways to a better 5G report by Ericsson found that 5G users are very likely to recommend their service provider’s brand to others, resulting in higher Net Promoter Scores (NPS). However, 5G remains an investment many service providers still ponder. To 5G, or not to 5G? A challenge for many operators is that, while 5G brings benefits to consumers, a lack of mature use cases means these benefits are still difficult to communicate. This makes monetizing 5G even harder. In fact, some mobile network operators (MNOs) that initially launched their 5G offering at a premium to their 4G services had to quickly revert their decision when 5G was first launched, due to a perceived lack of customer value. The reality is that implementing 5G is not cheap. The initial capital investment required to secure spectrum, radio access network, and IT infrastructure is substantial. Furthermore, while research suggests that 5G uptake will skyrocket in 2022, not all operators have the supporting infrastructure in place to reap its benefits. According to a study by Nokia, only eleven percent of global 5G providers have an appropriate business support system (BSS) in place for effective 5G monetization.The study also found that 98 percent may need to alter their BSS in some way to meet the demands of 5 G-powered business models. And with that, comes more funding. Therefore, creating effective monetization opportunities will be essential to ensure maximum return on both capital and organizational investments. Currently, the ROI isn’t there because users don’t see enough benefit. This is largely down to the maturity of most 5G use cases, which haven’t been happening long enough to help operators drive additional revenue. Leveraging the fifth generation It’s clear that 5G is a sizeable investment. Its cost, paired with a still-maturing infrastructure, is enough to make any operator second guess their priorities. But 5G will, without doubt, become a necessity for all service providers. There’s roughly a decade left until 2G and 3G become obsolete, so it’s a matter of time before 5G becomes essential. However, for those debating on whether to adopt now or later, considering the additional technologies that 5G can complement is an important thought. While not an enabler of embedded SIM (eSIM) technology, facets of 5G could certainly support several of its use cases. From a consumer perspective, a major benefit of 5G is for gaming due to its latency boon. With almost instant connectivity, 5G’s lack of lag could massively enhance the capability for mobile gaming. Here, the eSIM advantage comes into play. Multiple subscriptions can be accessed on a single eSIM-capable device, allowing consumers to swap as required. In this example, eSIMs could be used to enable a consumer to use a 5G data package for mobile gaming, and then switch back to a day-to-day 4G plan for more casual data usage. With this in mind, almost any application that can benefit from 5G could therefore be used in conjunction with eSIM, with the user able to seamlessly switch mobile plans depending on their needs. The benefits of 5G for the consumer are evident. However, whether 5G is a worthy investment for operators right now remains in question. Operators, particularly smaller service providers, should consider the additional competitive advantages 5G can facilitate if they’re still considering whether it’s worth it. That could mean its ability to enable eSIM technology, or a myriad of other benefits we’re still uncovering."

Today, the world is faced with a plethora of issues including environmental, social, and wealth gaps, among others. Addressing these issues is not limited to just big corporations. On an individual level, impact investing is becoming increasingly popular among investors as a way to generate specific beneficial social or environmental effects in addition to financial gains. Over the past few years, companies are now adopting non-financial factors and amore stakeholder-centric approach to doing business using what is known as ESG. ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. Investors and businesses alike are increasingly applying ESG as criteria for making decisions about their company’s operations, global impacts, and what they invest their money on. For example, companies are now divesting from fossil fuels projects to investing in renewables like solar and wind.  However, in recent years, ESG has come under criticism and thatESG ratings are not what they seem. A recent report by Bloomberg found that MSCI, “the largest ESG rating company, doesn’t even try to measure the impact of a corporation on the world.” To adress some of the ESG concerns and impact, one startup has made its mission to empower the transition to a more sustainable and purposeful world by linking ESG and impact data with strategic business performance. EnterProof of Impact (POI), a San Diego, California-based sustainable startup that has created a unique product toolset that enables purpose-driven investors, asset managers, enterprises, consultants, and other institutions to better understand and fulfill their impact- and ESG-related objectives and progress. POI is also integrated with over 200 industry-leading tools (and counting) so that ESG-conscious companies can get the most out of the tools they already use. Today,Proof of Impact announced it has raised a $6 million raise in Pre-Series A fundingfor its next-generation platform for ESG and impact data intelligence. The round was led by Rakuten Capital with first-time participation from a global suite of investors including Franklin Templeton Blockchain Fund, Five T, Blockrocket VC, and Advaita Capital. Existing investors Franklin Templeton Advisors, CV VC, Working Capital Fund, Asiri and Oxford Angel Fund also participated. This Pre-Series A round was substantially oversubscribed and was expanded from the initial $5 million target. The round closed less than eight months after POI’s $2.3 million seed round. Founded in 2019 byFleur Heyns, Iulian Circo, and Kevin Dean Pettit,Proof of Impact is a data intelligence startup that bridges the gap in ESG and impact data. The companyprovides a digital platform to collect, verify, and visualize ESG and impact data in order to generate granular insights and contextual analysis, translating raw ESG & impact data into actionable intelligence. Proof of Impact also provides the greater purpose-driven economy with the ability to comprehensively view companies’ past and predicted performance towards their social and environmental objectives — for transparent, continuous, and dynamic impact management at scale. Proof of Impact has created a unique product toolset that enables purpose-driven investors, asset managers, enterprises, consultants and other institutions to better understand and fulfill their impact- and ESG-related objectives and progress — with the unique goal of tying verified impact to financial performance. The platform operates in more than 30 different industries, and its client base of over 100 companies has grown to span six continents. Collectively, customers have entrusted Proof of Impact with over one billion ESG and impact data points that have been validated by its platform. The new funding will allow Proof of Impact to accelerate go-to-market efforts focused on private credit and private equity fund managers, expand its impact-linked finance solutions, and further extend its core product offering by incorporating blockchain-based innovations in the form of proprietary impact oracles. Proof of Impact will additionally leverage the deep expertise and insight of two new appointments to its Board of Directors: Oskar Mielczarek de la Miel from Rakuten and Gayatri Sarkar of Advaita Capital. The directors will provide focused strategic guidance as the company drives growth and scaling efforts adding to an assemblage of industry veterans with vast experience in technology, finance and impact investing. “Proof of Impact’s strategy of empowering businesses to measure and improve their impact on the environment and society is consistent with Rakuten Group’s mission and sustainability goals. We were impressed with the company’s data-driven products and the management team’s demonstrated ability to rapidly grow their customer base. We look forward to working with them on the next stage of their growth,” noted Oskar Mielczarek de la Miel, Managing Partner at Rakuten Capital."

The commission-free trading app found itself in hot water after theNew York State’s financial regulator fined the crypto unit of Robinhood $30 million for alleged violations of anti-money-laundering, cybersecurity, and consumer protection rules. In a statement today, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said that Robinhood Crypto did not devote sufficient resources to address compliance and cybersecurity risks. According to an order filed Tuesday, NYDFS said that Robinhood crypto unitmust enlist an independent consultant to monitor compliance, according to an order filed Tuesday. The crypto company also disclosed last year that it expected to pay the penalty. As part of the settlement, theNew York State’s financial regulator said Robinhood Crypto will also be required to retain an independent consultant to evaluate its compliance practices. Over the last two years,Robinhood has been at the center of several regulatory probes. As we reported a year ago,U.S. financial regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA),has orderedRobinhood Financial LLC to pay $70 millionfor ‘systemic supervisory failures’ and ‘false information and outages’ that harmed thousands of consumers. “We are pleased the settlement in principle reached last year and previously disclosed in our public filings is now final,” Cheryl Crumpton, associate general counsel of litigation and regulatory enforcement at Robinhood, said on Tuesday. Robinhood is not new to this type of accusation. In January 2021, a class action suit was brought against Robinhood accusing the trading app of “market manipulation.” The New York Attorney General Latitia James said at the time that her office was reviewing the Robinhood trading app and activity related to GameStop, as investors sue the firm after it froze stock buys for the games retailer during a major price surge. “We are aware of concerns raised regarding activity on the Robinhood app, including trading related to the GameStop stock. We are reviewing this matter,”James said in astatement. Founded in 2015 by co-founders and Co-CEOs Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt,Robinhood provides commission-free trading for several major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Robinhood also offers commission-free U.S. equity and options trading, as well as margin and extended hours trading through Robinhood Gold. The platform also offersreal-time market data for nearly a dozen more digital assets. Robinhood currently has over three million users and billions of dollars in transaction volume."
2022.8.2,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/02/eu-countries-now-banning-google-analytics/,"On August 17, 2020, The Italian Supervisory Authority (SA) banned the use of Google Analytics, ruling that itwas non-compliant with EU data protection rules. They banned the popular analytics tool, finding that the protections Google applied were not sufficient to address the risk, and the use of Google Analytics violates the bloc’s data protection rules over the data export issue. Compounding the trouble, an e-Commerce website using Google Analytics without the safeguards set out in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) violates data protection law putting any e-Commerce business at a major risk. “Now more than ever, small and mid-size companies need to own their data,” explains Mikel Lindsaar, CEO ofStoreConnect, a startup that helps small- to mid-size e-Commerce businesses in the US so they can own their own data, be GDPR compliant and compete globally with the Goliath e-Commerce companies … in essence leveling the playing field.“Everything they collect from their customers should end up in their own store and database, making them compliant with GDPR,”Lindsaar added. France and Austria have also deemed the tool illegal, and Denmark is the latest EU country to do so. Technically, the Schrems II case in 2020 made data transfers between Europe and the U.S. illegal. However, that case found the existing agreement, the Privacy Shield, between the U.S. and the EU was not compatible because the American law allows its government to requisition client data from companies on national security grounds, something which is prohibited under GDPR. Businesses using Google Analytics must therefore have a technical understanding of their data flows, including where the data is going, who is receiving the data, and how the data is protected. Cookies are also used to track data, but they are not the only means of collecting and transferring data. Google Analytics and similar services can receive personal data through other means. For instance, a website or app could still send personal data to Google via HTTP parameters or browser/device fingerprinting, among other means, to track users across web properties. That is why it’s essential a technical analysis is conducted to learn which of these types of services are used by a website or app and what mitigations are needed. Millions of European businesses are poised to be affected by the banning of Google Analytics, resulting in several possible scenarios. The first is a total ban of Google Analytics in Europe, leaving American companies unable to operate in the EU. Another possibility is United States-based tech companies switch to storing and consolidating data in Europe to ensure they’re compliant with GDPR. But that goes against the CLOUD Act that requires American service providers to be able to provide U.S. authorities with any domestic or international data when asked, that is stored in their servers. A third option is for EU businesses to find an alternative to Google Analytics, while a final possibility is enforcement of the Innovation and Choice Online Act that targets big tech companies for potential antitrust and consumer choice violations. While EU authorities and the U.S. work to reach a data transfer agreement, there are other analytics options available beyond Google’s. A solution like StoreConnect allows customer data to be maintained within a business’ own systems and not be exported at all. This lets small to mid-size companies continue to gain useful data from “internal” analytics while remaining GDPR compliant. “With StoreConnect, small and mid-size companies CAN own their data,” continues Lindsaar. “Equally important, businesses using StoreConnect still have the information that enables them to understand what their customers are doing in their store, while being CDPR compliant.” StoreConnect provides a Salesforce-native eCommerce solution 3.0 for small-to-medium-sized businesses that enables these companies to enter the global eCommerce marketplace and scale to grow at any pace imaginable. “For small- to medium-sized businesses, Time is Money and StoreConnect is Time. Well Spent,” says Lindsaar. “By adopting StoreConnect, retailers already using Salesforce simply add POS, eCommerce, website, web form and digital engagement features to the customer service and management, order and inventory, and marketing capabilities of Salesforce.” StoreConnect is a subscription and usage-based eCommerce, Point of Sale, and Content Management System built on and within Salesforce, which allows users to integrate Marketing, Sales, and Support systems into one platform. StoreConnect targets Small to Medium Businesses who want to provide the same “full service” customer experience that is being provided by eCommerce leaders, but at a fraction of the cost."

Companies dedicate a large portion of their time to meeting the regulatory requirements instead of using the time to grow their businesses. Now, one tech startup has come to their rescue. Enter RegScale, a Tyson, Virginia-basedcompliance tech startup thatdelivers continuous compliance automation for heavily regulated industries, freeing organizations from paper via its security and compliance automation software. Through its Continuous Compliance Automation platform, RegScale helps businesses to meet any regulatory requirement with 70+ compliance requirements such as NIST, ISO, SOX, CMMC, and NERC-CIP supported out of the box and the ability for RegScale to digitize any regulation in under a week. Today,RegScale announced it has raised a $20 million Series A funding round led by SYN Ventures with participation from SineWave Ventures, VIPC’s Virginia Venture Partners, SecureOctane, and several strategic investors. The fund news came just eight months after its founding. RegScale will use the new capital infusionto drive sales and marketing initiatives initially targeted in the company’s three primary markets—government, financial institutions, and energy and utilities—and accelerate product development to meet the needs of customers globally. “RegScale is leading the way in ‘shifting left’ compliance to accelerate digital transformation programs, reduce risk, and lower the costs of manual compliance documentation while delivering rapid time-to-value which our customers are demanding,” said Anil Karmel, co-founder and chief executive officer, RegScale. “As such, we are launching the ‘RegOps’ [Regulatory Operations] Movement to help heavily regulated organizations evolve and improve compliance and trust at a faster pace than organizations using traditional compliance artifact development and compliance management processes.” Since the company launched 8 months ago, RegScale has recorded triple-digit revenue growth with nearly 8,000 downloads of its freemium Community Edition platform and signing more than a dozen major customers for its Enterprise Edition platform. This new round of funding will also allow the company to expand operational support to meet growing customer demand. “Cyber compliance has become a $10.5 trillion existential challenge, and major industry trends in technology are focused on new and innovative approaches to solve this complex and evolving dilemma for heavily regulated organizations,” said Art Coviello, Jr., the investment committee chairman, SYN Ventures, and RegScale board member. “SYN Ventures exists to empower companies like RegScale that are succeeding in creating transformational and disruptive solutions that significantly reduce technology and compliance risk.” RegScale formally launched in November 2021 as an offshoot of digital transformation services company C2 Labs, to help organizations in heavily regulated industries continuously manage the massive year-over-year growth in their compliance burden. The company’s continuous compliance automation platform moves organizations from manual compliance approaches and processes to an API-centric, automated approach. Its next-generation Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platform integrates with existing security and compliance platforms, delivering evergreen compliance documentation while simultaneously visualizing compliance and operational risk to decision makers in real-time. “At RegScale we believe that maintaining compliance as a business should be affordable, transparent, and easy,” said Travis Howerton, co-founder and chief technology officer, RegScale. “That is why we are dedicated to ensuring that our entire customer base is able to continuously comply with multiple requirements leveraging a scalable platform that can meet the needs of the entire organization, no matter the sector or industry.”"

In the latest heist to hit the crypto space,U.S.-based crypto exchange Nomad has been hit by a $190 million theft, according to a report by blockchain researchers. The revelation comes just a week afterNomad raised $22 million from investors. In a tweet,Nomad said it was “aware of the incident” and was currently investigating, without giving further details or the value of the theft. “We are aware of the incident involving the Nomad token bridge. We are currently investigating and will provide updates when we have them,” Nomad said. https://twitter.com/nomadxyz_/status/1554246853348036608 It’s not entirely clear how the crypto theft was orchestrated. But crypto analytics firm PeckShield told Reuters that $190 million worth of users’ cryptocurrencies were stolen, including ether and the stablecoin USDC. Other blockchain researchers put the figure at over $150 million. However, in a follow-up tweet early this morning, Nomad said it was able to recover some of the funds without specifying the amount. “Was able to recover some of the funds. Do let us know what we should do to return them,” the company added. Was able to recover some of the funds. Do let us know what we should do to return them. pic.twitter.com/A8O5RGB7q6 — mathletamine (@mathletamine) August 2, 2022  In a statement to crypto news outlet CoinDesk, Nomad said it hasnotified law enforcement and is working with blockchain forensics firms to try to identify the accounts involved and get back the funds. Nomad becomes the fourth victim of crypto theft. Last August,hackers stole over $90 million worth of crypto coins from the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Liquid. The crypto startup also said thatsome of its digital currency wallets had been “compromised,” and that hackers were transferring the assets to four different wallets. Update (10:06 AM EST): We now have more details about the attack. According to blockchain security experts, itstarted with an upgrade to Nomad’s code. “One part of the code was marked as valid whenever users decided to initiate a transfer, which allowed thieves to withdraw more assets than were deposited into the platform. Once other attackers cottoned on to what was going on, they deployed armies of bots to carry out copycat attacks,” CNBC reported. Security experts described the exploitas a “free-for-all,” Anyone with knowledge of the exploit and how it worked could seize on the flaw and withdraw any amount of tokens from Nomad — kind of like a cash machine spewing out money at the tap of a button. Victor Young, founder and chief architect of crypto startup Analog told CNBC,“Without prior programming experience, any user could simply copy the original attackers’ transaction call data and substitute the address with theirs to exploit the protocol.” Young added,“Unlike previous attacks, the Nomad hack became a free-for-all where multiple users started to drain the network by simply replaying the original attackers’ transaction call data.” Sam Sun, a research partner at crypto-focused investment firm Paradigm, also described the exploit as “one of the most chaotic hacks that Web3 has ever seen.”"

EnterVISENSE, a Switzerland-basedindustrial internet of things (IIoT) tech startup that provides diagnostic solutions and helps producers with insights into visual observable machine errors, allowing them to identify and avoid downtime losses.Unlike other IIoT computer vision solutions on the market, VISENSE exclusively focuses on machine processes to identify errors. Today,VISENSE announced it has closed CHF 750.000 (approximately €750.000) in pre-seed funding round to further develop the AI and ML VISENSE software. The round was backed by Czech AI Startup Incubator, Swiss Serpentine Ventures and Venture Kick, German HPI Seed Fund, and several Business Angels. Founded by co-founder and CEOChristian Reich, VISENSE diagnostic solution provides producers with insights into visual observable machine errors, allowing them to identify and avoid downtime losses.The startup has already initiated cooperation with manufacturers, including multinational automotive corporation BMW Group and companies in the packaging and piping system sectors. Unplanned downtime represents one of the major issues for manufacturers, causing loss of productivity and revenue, delays, and dissatisfaction among customers. According to Aberdeen Research, over 80% of producers recorded an unexpected downtime in the past three years, leading to an hourly cost of up to $260.000. A study by Vanson Bourne sponsored by ServiceMax revealed that more than 70% of manufacturers aren’t fully aware when their machines are due for maintenance, upgrade, or replacement. Other recent studies reported that downtime costs the industrial sector about $50 billion annually. While manufacturers acknowledge the significance of downtime, they lack digitized tools and processes, data, time, and effective analysis methods, creating a need for developing and utilizing IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) solutions. With the increasing demand for automation and quality inspection across the industrial manufacturing sector, VISENSE enters a market with high potential. According to Grand View Research, the global machine vision market is projected to grow at a 7.7% CAGR from $14.3 billion in 2021 to $25.9 billion in 2030. The IIoT technology VISENSE, developed by a Swiss team, brings industrial producers a solution to the ongoing downtime issue. Using industrial cameras and selected sensors, VISENSE provides manufacturers with insights to quickly identify and resolve unexpected visually-observable industrial machine errors. The software utilizes computer vision and machine learning to deliver error analysis and digitalize processes around the machines.  In a statement, VISENSE co-founder and CEO Christian Reich said, “VISENSE is able to autonomously detect and save all occurring machine error incidents and replace expensive process observation by machine operators and planners. The technology doesn’t need any data integration, is installed within minutes, and has versatile areas of application – whether shortening the ramp-up of new or optimizing machines in operation and makes processes that are undetectable to the bare eye visible.” “Manufacturers will be able to purchase products that provide necessary AI capabilities without outside support, saving them the cost of hiring external resources to oversee their AI-related projects. This is one of the fundamental presumptions VISENSE is working on with its product development. It has created the “eyes” and “brain” of a system that watches over and controls industrial robots and machinery in specific production environments. VISENSE is the first in line for this enormous leap in a future where machines would monitor their own and other machines’ work to ensure quality,” says Angelo Burgarello, Business Director, Partner, and Investor at AI Startup Incubator. With VISENSE, manufacturers are able to cut the time needed to identify, report, and resolve errors by up to 50%. Unlike other IIoT solutions, VISENSE exclusively focuses on machine processes to identify errors. And while the system requires machines to have automated and visually-observable processes, it can be applied to any industry. “As a particle physicist, data scientist with IIoT experience, and business angel, I am extraordinarily impressed by the team. After discovering their deep knowledge of solving customer problems and their intellectual capability to generalize solutions of individual projects into a single scalable data-driven framework, I knew that I had to invest as much as I could,” says Dr. Dehua Zhu, Business Angel and Investor of VISENSE. As a sign of confidence in the company’s direction, VISENSE has already attracted substantial potential clients in the automotive, packaging, and piping system sectors, including the BMW Group, with whom the startup successfully completed a PoC (Proof of Concept) project and is currently working on integrating the solution across their plants."

Citing turmoil in the crypto market, Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev wrote in a blog post, “Since that time, we have seen additional deterioration of the macro environment, with inflation at 40-year highs accompanied by a broad crypto market crash. This has further reduced customer trading activity and assets under custody. Last year, we staffed many of our operations functions under the assumption that the heightened retail engagement we had been seeing with the stock and crypto markets in the COVID era would persist into 2022.” Robinhood’s announcement came the same day its crypto unit was fined $30 million by New York State’s financial regulatorfor alleged violations of anti-money-laundering, cybersecurity, and consumer protection rules. Founded in 2015 by co-founders and Co-CEOs Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt,Robinhood provides commission-free trading for several major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Robinhood also offers commission-free U.S. equity and options trading, as well as margin and extended hours trading through Robinhood Gold. The platform also offersreal-time market data for nearly a dozen more digital assets. Robinhood currently has over three million users and billions of dollars in transaction volume. Below is the message Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev shared with Robinhood employees following a company-wide meeting to discuss a reorganization of the business and a further reduction in headcount. Dear Robinhoodies, As part of a broader company reorganization into a General Manager (GM) structure, I just announced that we are reducing our headcount by approximately 23%. While employees from all functions will be impacted, the changes are particularly concentrated in our operations, marketing, and program management functions. I want to acknowledge how unsettling these types of changes are. We often talk about our mission to democratize finance for all, and one of the most cherished aspects of Robinhood is the teamwork and camaraderie involved in working towards our mission — together. I feel incredibly privileged and fortunate to have the opportunity to build with all of you. Let me explain how we arrived at this decision. Earlier this year, I announced that we would be letting go of 9% of our workforce and focusing on greater cost discipline throughout the organization. This did not go far enough. Since that time, we have seen additional deterioration of the macro environment, with inflation at 40-year highs accompanied by a broad crypto market crash. This has further reduced customer trading activity and assets under custody. Last year, we staffed many of our operations functions under the assumption that the heightened retail engagement we had been seeing with the stock and crypto markets in the COVID era would persist into 2022. In this new environment, we are operating with more staffing than appropriate. As CEO, I approved and took responsibility for our ambitious staffing trajectory – this is on me. In addition, our mandate to drive greater cost discipline and accountability has made it clear that we need to change our organizational structure. We will be moving to a General Manager (GM) structure, where GMs will assume broad responsibility for our individual businesses. This change will flatten hierarchies, reduce cross-functional dependencies, and remove redundant roles and positions. There is a lot to go through here, and we will discuss our new structure in more depth at this Thursday’s All-Hands. Our business realities don’t make this conversation any less difficult or the decisions any less painful. I share this to be as transparent as I can with all of you who work every day to deliver on our mission. We will be parting ways with many incredibly talented people today in an extremely challenging macro environment, and I want to reduce the burden of this difficult transition as much as possible. Everyone will receive an email and a Slack message with your status – with resources and support if you are leaving. We’re sending everyone a message immediately after this meeting so you don’t have to wait for clarity. Departing Robinhoodies will be offered the opportunity to remain employed with Robinhood through October 1, 2022 and receive their regular pay and benefits (including equity vesting). They will also be offered cash severance, payment of COBRA medical, dental and vision insurance premiums and job search assistance (including an opt in Robinhood Alumni Talent Directory). Each impacted Hoodie will be able to schedule time with our people team to discuss their specific situation live. We know that this news is tough for all Robinhoodies, and we are also offering wellness support to those who would like it. To those who remain, I know that our new organizational structure and the departure of our colleagues will be another challenge to adapt to. In the short seven years since Robinhood launched to the world, we have adapted to challenges and forced the financial industry to adapt to us. We’ve overcome many obstacles and have emerged from each a stronger and more resilient company. This will be no different. As always, see you this Thursday at All-Hands. Sincerely, Vlad"
2022.8.4,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/04/faa-selected-new-york-uas-test-site-nyuasts-utm-field-test-project/,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has awarded a task order contract to the New York UAS Test Site (NYUASTS) for the next uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS or drone) integration project to help advance the reality of safe, high-volume drone operations, and the development of a UAS traffic management (UTM) system. The UTM Field Test (UFT) project will be managed by NUAIR on behalf of the NYUASTS located in Oneida County, NY, and conducted within the 50-Mile Drone Corridor between Rome and Syracuse. The project will provide the FAA and industry with information to support policy development and will help the industry update standards to support beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) operations – a critical element in unlocking the true potential of routine, commercial drone operations. The need for drone operators to safely utilize low-altitude airspace (below 400 feet above ground level) continues to grow with more business cases where drones operate both in visual line-of-sight and beyond visual line-of-sight. The FAA recognizes the benefits of supporting these more complex drone operations at low altitudes safely, equitably, and efficiently and continues to collaborate with the industry through projects like the UFT to improve UTM and other enabling technologies. “Oneida County’s UAS Test Site has been leading the way for industry research and development, and being awarded this project validates the fine work being done by NUAIR and our partners,” said Oneida County Executive Anthony J. Picente Jr. “We are honored to be selected to conduct this important testing that will advance the technology to greater heights, and we thank the FAA for this opportunity.” NUAIR and the FAA kicked off the UFT project in July with the goal of completing the project by spring of 2023. Project team partners include ANRA Technologies, AX Enterprize, Cal Analytics, Oneida County Sheriff’s Office, Oneida Indian Nation, and OneSky. Each of these partners was selected based on their leadership in UTM technology and their willingness to continue to progress the state of the technology. The partners are an essential part of conducting the testing necessary to evaluate the ability of new constructs to enhance the capabilities of UTM for future operations. Test infrastructure updated through field testing activities will allow for the continued collaboration between the FAA and UTM community and support the maturation of a UTM ecosystem. NUAIR was founded as a not-for-profit organization in 2012 to manage the NYUASTS, one of the seven FAA-designated UAS Test Sites in the United States, focused on supporting the development and safe integration of UAS into the national airspace system. The NYUASTS is the only test site located at a towered airport (Griffiss International), is covered by low altitude authorization and notification capability (LAANC), and is surrounded by Class D airspace. NUAIR has helped develop New York’s 50-Mile Drone Corridor and has conducted over 4,000 drone operations since its inception, supporting safe, efficient, and economically viable drone operations. “NUAIR continues to have a close relationship with the FAA to help develop and test the policies and regulations needed for safe, advanced UAS operations,” said NUAIR CEO Ken Stewart. “NUAIR, with our array of assets in New York, have the capabilities, expertise, and real-world environments needed to prove out the elements outlined within this project, and once again we look forward to helping the FAA and industry realize the goal of routine commercial UAS operations.” Empire State Development President, CEO and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “The advancements that are happening at the New York UAS Test Site by NUAIR and their partners have continuously kept New York State at the forefront of advanced drone research and development. This newest project with the FAA will help further position New York as a global leader in the drone industry, which will attract new investment and opportunity to the state.”  NUAIR (Northeast UAS Airspace Integration Research Alliance, Inc.) is a New York-based nonprofit with a mission to safely integrate uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) into the national airspace, enabling scalable, economically viable commercial drone operations. NUAIR manages operations of the FAA-designated New York UAS Test Site at Griffiss International Airport, Rome, NY on behalf of Oneida County and is responsible for the advancement of New York’s 50-mile UAS Corridor between Rome and Syracuse, NY"

The partnership further shows that the ongoing crypto bear market has done little to stop investors’ interest in cryptocurrency. Coinbase shares soared by 14% immediately after the announcement. In a statement, Joseph Chalom, global head of strategic ecosystem partnerships at BlackRock, said:“Our institutional clients are increasingly interested in gaining exposure to digital asset markets and are focused on how to efficiently manage the operational lifecycle of these assets. The partnership will let them “manage their bitcoin exposures directly in their existing portfolio management and trading workflows.” The announcement comes the same week after Coinbase announced it is now approaching 100 million verified user accounts. The platform now boasts 98 million authenticated users, 13,000 organizations, and 230,000 network partners in over 100 nations. In March, BlackRock’s chairman Larry Fink wrote in a letter to shareholders that the firm is studying digital currencies, stablecoins, and the underlying technologies as the firm has seen increasing interest from clients.“A global digital payment system, thoughtfully designed, can enhance the settlement of international transactions while reducing the risk of money laundering and corruption,” Fink wrote. In recent months, BlackRock has been showing interest in cryptocurrencies.

CRM&BONUS was foundedin 2018 by Alexandre Zolko (CEO), Luiz Fernando Dias Guedes (COO), and Eduardo Luis dos Santos Vieira (CTO). The startup provides a platform that allows real-time control of giftback delivery to consumers, making it possible to measure the increases in billing and customer retention. The creation of the platform enabled TVZ / MyShoes, a fashion company founded and owned by Zolko’s family, to measure sales growth of around 15%. These results encouraged the founders to expand the operation of the platform. Zipper, on the other hand, creates personal e-commerce websites for salespeople of physical stores, enabling them to contact customers and offer them products, mainly through their mobile phones, and send targeted advertisements using geolocation to draw consumers to specific stores. Itsclients include the subsidiary of German athletic wear Adidas and chocolate maker Kopenhagen.

Currently, the solution serves more than 12,000 physical stores and e-commerce companies in Brazil and Portugal, with renowned clients such as Ambev, Arezzo, Vivara, Itaú, Adidas, L’Occitane, Alpagartas, Madeira, Grupo Soma, and Chilli Beans."
2022.8.4,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/04/walnut-disrupts-b2b-sales-industry-weareprospects-campaign/,"The SaaS industry has been booming over the past several years. After a global valuation of $31.5 billion in 2015, the market for cloud-based solutions is expected to reach a staggering $208 billion by the end of 2023, highlighting just how in demand these services have become. Image Source: Statista However, despite the widespread appeal of SaaS services, the B2B sales experience is still a long way from being anywhere near as effective as popular B2C models. With prospects being forced to endure painfully long sales cycles while being hand-held through a rigid funnel, many of the companies operating in this space are shooting themselves in the foot by not putting buyers first, which may be causing them to lose out on revenue-generating opportunities. In light of this, Walnut has launched its #WeAreProspects campaign in an effort to deliver more value to prospects and enhance B2B sales operations – thus creating a win-win for everyone involved. Walnut is a B2B Sales Experience Platform that enables sales teams to get the most value from each demo. The platform’s principal goal is to create the most customer-centric experience possible by giving sales reps all the tools and capabilities they need to directly appeal to each prospect’s unique wants, needs, and pain points. Walnut does this with its simple, intuitive no-code software, eliminating the need for back-end teams to engage in demo production. This gives complete control to the teaks who will provide the demos and the sales teams. Sales teams are also able to cop-paste past templates and quickly personalize each demo to the prospect in front of them, while also gathering critical information along the way. Insights from this data can be analyzed and utilized to influence strategy in future demonstrations. In addition, Walnut’s Sales Experience Platform is fully cloud-based. This means no more demo downtime or embarrassing blunders. By removing this uncertainty, sales professionals can concentrate on the task at hand and provide the best possible experience to prospects, increase conversions and generate more revenue.  Walnut’s #WeAreProspects web campaign endeavors to bring together several of the leading SaaS providers in order to shed light on the current poor level of service provided to prospects throughout the sales process. Throughout the campaign, Walnut will collaborate with various organizations to improve the B2B buying experience and provide more value to prospects through special offers, hence accelerating the widespread adoption of these services.  In general, the digital campaign intends to bring the B2B industry closer to the high expectations in the B2C market, particularly as purchasers continue to expect more from service providers. On that point, let’s take a look at some typical hurdles prospects face in the B2B industry. One of the most frustrating aspects of the buyer journey is how difficult it can be to take the product for a trial run. Traditionally, B2B companies make it hard for prospects to access their demo. Unfortunately, this means that the core features and benefits of the software are explained verbally rather than shown, which is far from optimal. Many sales representatives cannot handle objections correctly, whether due to a lack of information or training. Some salespeople even struggle to tell the difference between an objection and a rejection. However, 60% of clients say “no” four times before they say “yes.” Despite this, 48% of salespeople never make a single follow-up attempt. SaaS tools can help make this process easier for sales staff by giving them insights into the prospects they are facing. A Hubspot study found that the average B2B sales cycle tales 84 days. That’s a long time to wait to access a potentially business-changing piece of software. As a result, many of the SaaS tools participating in the campaign help reduce this by optimizing sales operations across various departments. Let’s take a look at some main participants, and the deals they are offering to prospects: Cloudshare saves time and money for B2B enterprises by reducing sales cycles and securing more contracts by generating personalized, interactive demos in just a few clicks, allowing prospects to test drive the product early in the sales process. You can get special discounts as part of the promotion if you sign up for an annual contract. Similarweb provides a Sales Intelligence platform that helps sales teams access valuable insights into their prospects and target audience. Information such as traffic trends and engagement metrics can help sales and marketing teams find potential clients that are more likely to qualify as quality leads. As part of the campaign, customers can get a free trial of the software. Contractbook is a collaborative contract management platform that automates the sales cycle and syncs contract data across corporate platforms to present both buyers and sellers with a seamless sales experience. Postal is a simple and effective offline marketing engagement platform that enables go-to-market teams to scale, execute, and assess their offline marketing strategy in order to develop their business. Mentioning #WeAreProspects will get you a free trial of the program. Through targeted training and development, as well as contemporary sales and leadership enablement, Sales Assembly accelerates the success of every single team, persona, and individual inside your revenue organization. Dooly‘s integrated workplace allows revenue teams to easily share information with the people who need to know it. The platform gives sales teams a uniform experience, making the buyer’s journey as simple as possible. You can get a free 14-day Dooly Premier trial by saying that you found them through the #WeAreProspects campaign."

VinFast is a subsidiary of Vingroup, Vietnam’s largest conglomerate founded by Vietnam’s richest man Phạm Nhật Vượng. To further ramp up production,VinFast announced today that it’s looking to hire new 8,000 employees for its electric-vehicle plant in Haiphong, Vietnam, and deliver its first battery-powered SUVs in the United States by the end of this year, according to a report from Reuters.VinFast currently employs a total of 6,000 people. The announcement also comes at a time the tech sector is going through a mass layoff. As we reported on Monday, more than 32,000 tech workers lost their jobs in July.More tech companies are also planning to trim their workforces to counter market challenges amid the global economic downturn. In a Facebook post on its verified account, VinFast said the “new recruitments are for VinFast’s production expansion.” The company added that“new staff, including assembly workers, technicians, and engineers will start working from August and September.” According to the post, the Haiphong plant has the capacity to produce 250,000 electric cars per year and VinFast added that it expects to upgrade that capacity to 600,000 by 2026.VinFast is also building a $2 billion factory in North Carolina and already opened six showrooms in California, with plans for more in the future.

2022.8.5,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/05/amazon-buys-roomba-vacuum-cleaner-maker-irobot-1-7-billion-cash-deal/,"Amazon announced today it has acquired the maker of Roomba robot vacuum cleaner iRobot Corpfor $1.7 billion in an all-cash deal, as part of the latest push to grow its connected device cart products andadd to its cart of smart home devices. The announcement comes less than a month afterthe retail giant acquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash to make inroadsinto the $3 trillion healthcare industry. As part of the deal,Amazon said it will pay $61 per share, valuing iRobot at a premium of 22% from the stock’s last closing price of $49.99, a good bargain for Amazon considering that iRobot was once traded at $197.4 at its peak during pandemic lockdowns. Unlike other vacuum cleaners on the market,Roomba is targeted at hygiene-conscious consumers. The Roomba vacuums can cost as much as $1,000 to collect spatial data on households that could prove valuable to companies developing so-called smart home technology. In a statement announcing the acquisition, Amazon said, “Since introducing the Roomba vacuum in 2002, iRobot has continued to delight customers with every product generation, saving customers valuable time previously spent on household chores.The team at iRobot has developed innovative cleaning products that customers love.” “We know that saving time matters, and chores take precious time that can be better spent doing something that customers love,” said Dave Limp, SVP of Amazon Devices. “Over many years, the iRobot team has proven its ability to reinvent how people clean with products that are incredibly practical and inventive—from cleaning when and where customers want while avoiding common obstacles in the home, to automatically emptying the collection bin. Customers love iRobot products—and I’m excited to work with the iRobot team to invent in ways that make customers’ lives easier and more enjoyable.” On completion of the deal, Colin Angle, chairman and CEO of iRobot, will remain as CEO of iRobot. “Since we started iRobot, our team has been on a mission to create innovative, practical products that make customers’ lives easier, leading to inventions like the Roomba and iRobot OS,” saidAngle. “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.”"

With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.8.6,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions.

Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness.

Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.8.7,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.8.7,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

While more than 250,000 brick & mortar locations accept SNAP benefits via EBT in-store, only a fraction have been approved for online EBT. Many SNAP recipients are homebound, lack transportation, or live in a food desert without easy access to grocery stores; many others want to avoid in-person shopping due to concerns about COVID. While many Americans were able to shift to online grocery shopping during the pandemic, SNAP recipients were not afforded this safety and convenience because they are effectively unable to use their benefits online. Forage has an in-house team of EBT and payments experts, including former Instacart and Freshop employees. In addition to its stand-alone EBT solution, Forage developed and recently launched the first Shopify app that offers online EBT payment processing to Shopify’s ecosystem of merchants. The company is already working with dozens of well-known grocers to help them accelerate their path to accepting SNAP EBT online. “Forage is tackling a critical problem for consumers and merchants as more groceries are bought online,” said Tom Brown, Partner at Nyca Partners. “Nyca is excited to back the incredible team on their mission of making it as easy for eligible merchants to accept EBT as any other form of payment.” Forage provides merchants with support through every step of the USDA approval process, from preparing the required documentation, through system engineering and testing, to deployment, making it as easy as possible for new merchants to accept EBT online, with the goal of opening the online EBT space to more merchants and ultimately more SNAP recipients."

2022.8.9,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/09/ankr-launches-ankr-token-staking-allow-web3-users-earn-rewards/,"• 70% of the tokens are distributed to the node — 49% going to individual stakers and 51% allocated to node providers • 30% of the tokens go to the Ankr Treasury (controlled by Ankr DAO) • Nodes are required to stake 100,000 ANKR tokens to participate in the network Web3 infrastructure provider Ankr Network today announced the launch of ANKR token staking to allow its users andarray of node providers to operate full archive nodes on blockchains through the Ankr network and earn a portion of the fees paid to node operators. The announcement comes two months afterAnkr became anRPC (Remote Procedure Call) provider toOptimism, a blazing-fast and low-cost Layer-2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain. The Ankr Network is a decentralized RPC network that is providing this first-of-its-kind solution for enterprise Web3 infrastructure. For the first time ever, Web3 users will be able to stake to full and archive nodes on blockchains to earn a share of the fees paid to node operators for access to blockchains – all via the Ankr Network. The Ankr Network provides fundamental infrastructure technology that helps blockchain networks run faster and more reliably by connecting a global network of operators who run enterprise grade nodes with Web3 developers, dApps, and enterprises to facilitate crypto transactions. Ankr recently unveiled its biggest ever upgrade to this service, the Ankr Network 2.0, outlining its transition from a centralized infrastructure platform to a decentralized infrastructure protocol. The move puts Ankr in a class of its own as the largest decentralized infrastructure provider in the space and the only enterprise-grade decentralized infrastructure provider. With the launch of ANKR token staking, all ANKR token holders will now have the opportunity to directly participate in the growth of Web3 systems. With over 7 billion traffic requests moving through the Ankr Network daily, the 2.0 upgrade allows for node providers to join the Ankr network and for ANKR token holders to stake and earn fees alongside these node providers. “Today marks a monumental achievement for Ankr. One where we have moved from a centralized infrastructure provider to a truly decentralized protocol solution, where token holders can contribute and earn across the network with us. This puts Ankr in a class of its own, as not only one of the best technology companies in the industry, but one of the best pure plays for aligning with Multichain growth across web3,” said Greg Gopman, Chief Marketing Officer at Ankr. Not a Proof-of-Stake blockchain itself, Ankr supports all major PoS blockchains as a protocol that operates a vast network of nodes on both the development layer (full nodes) and the consensus layer (validator nodes). The Ankr Network currently serves over 80% of blockchain traffic on Polygon, Fantom, and BNB Chain and has a chance to be the market leader on Ethereum too as it moves to Proof of Stake, where Ankr usually wins on speed and pricing. Staking is essential in keeping the network running smoothly as it ensures node providers keep within performance standards, which in turn ensures that developers receive extremely fast and reliable returns for all RPC requests made. To earn the right to serve RPC traffic coming to the Ankr Network, node providers need to self-stake 100,000 $ANKR to their nodes, which acts as an insurance deposit. In addition, token holders will have the ability to signal support for individual node providers on the Ankr Network by staking ANKR to back their nodes. By delegating ANKR to node providers, community members play an active role in discerning which service providers are reputable, performant, and worthy of a reputational boost. Once their nodes are serving blockchain request calls coming to Ankr Network, node providers are able to receive ANKR rewards for every request served. From all rewards coming to the independent nodes on Ankr Network:  Since nodes will serve local traffic in their respective parts of the world, Ankr Network can achieve extremely low latency thanks to vast geo-distribution. It also enables the free market to influence where nodes are located. Launched in 2021,Ankr helps blockchain companies run their blockchains faster, enabling them to offer users the best Web3 experiences. The Ankr Protocol serves 250 billion RPC requests a month across 50 blockchain networks and runs RPC services for 18 blockchain partners, making it the largest RPC provider in the industry. In 2022, Ankr added the Web3 gaming SDK, multi-chain liquid staking tools, and App Chains to its developer product suite.Ankr also offers a suite of developer tools including the Liquid Staking SDK, Web3 Gaming SDK, and App Chains As a Service that empower dApp developers to build Web3 apps quickly and easily."

However, introducing purpose-built smart carts to a store is often operationally complicated and very costly. EnterShopic, a Tel Aviv, Israel-basedsmart grocery shopping startup that provides a frictionless shopping experience for medium and large grocery stores. Shopic overcomes these challenges with an AI-powered clip-on device that can turn any standard shopping cart into a smart cart. We wrote about Shopic a year ago after the Israeli startup closed a $10 million funding to let consumers make purchases in large retail chains without having to wait in line at checkouts. A lot has changed since then. The startup has expanded its footprint. Through partnerships, its AI-enabled smart cart has now been deployed in top grocery chains around the world. Today, Shopicannounced it has raised a $35 million Series B funding to bring its AI-enabled smart cart to top U.S. grocery chains. The round which brings SHopic’stotal funding raised to $56 million, wasled by Qualcomm Ventures, with participation from other investors including Vintage Investment Partners and Clal Insurance, together with Shopic’s existing investors IBI Tech Fund, Tal Ventures, and Shufersal. Founded in 2015 by CEO Raz Golan, Dan Bendler, and Eran Kravitz,Shopic is transforming brick-and-mortar stores with its frictionless, personalized retail solutions. The company has developed an AI-powered device that can be attached to any standard shopping cart, turning it into a smart cart. Shopic offers an AI-powered clip-on device that transforms shopping carts into smart carts. Utilizing computer vision algorithms, Shopic identifies items placed in the cart in real-time, while displaying to shoppers product promotions and discounts on related products. The Shopic system acts as a self-service checkout interface as well, saving customers the time and hassle of standing in line to pay.  Data collected by the company during live deployments of its system found that Shopic’s solution increased shoppers’ monthly spending by 8%. Shopic not only delivers a new retail experience for in-store shoppers but also provides real-time inventory management and customer behavioral insights for grocers through its analytics dashboard. These reports also include aisle heatmaps, promotion monitoring, and new product adoption metrics. “Today’s consumers are used to friction-free online shopping experiences, but retailers struggle to deliver them for in-store shoppers,” said Raz Golan, CEO and co-founder of Shopic. “As the only solution that uses full computer vision rather than barcode scanning, Shopic empowers retailers to not only meet customer expectations but to delight them”. The Series B investment will be used to expand the company’s penetration of global markets. Shopic’s solutions are already deployed by several grocers in Europe, the Americas, and Israel. They include some of the world’s largest supermarket chains. As opposed to monolithic smart carts, such as Amazon Dash, Shopic’s clip-on device can be used with any shopping cart, offering a highly cost-effective implementation path for grocers. Additionally, shoppers can remove the device when their transactions are complete and use the cart to take their groceries out to the parking lot, completing a truly frictionless shelf-to-car shopping journey. Inside the cart, Shopic uses a camera duo that enables its AI-computer vision model to support large catalogs of over 50,000 items, cover edge cases and achieve low latency with limited processing power. The algorithm can even identify products thrown into the cart even when it’s in motion or when people put multiple products in their carts simultaneously. Merav Weinryb, VP of Qualcomm Israel Ltd. and Managing Director of Qualcomm Ventures Israel and Europe, said: “We support Shopic’s vision of hybrid retail, where the best of online shopping and physical store experiences merge.

As the Earth’s temperature increases, it causes more snow and ice to melt each summer, which exposes the underlyingprecious minerals.An example of this can be in Greenland wheremore than 8 billion tons of ice melts per day for several days in July 2021, which later exposed precious minerals buried under the ice. But one tech startup did not let this crisis goes to waste. KoBold Metals is a California-based mineral exploration tech startup company that uses artificial intelligence (A) to explore rare minerals buried beneath Greenland’s ice to power electric vehicles and support the transition torenewable energy.Since its inception four years ago,KoBold Metals has attracted the interest of investors looking to tap into the opportunities with the hope ofreaping the future windfall. In February of this year,KoBold Metalsraised $192.5m in a Series B funding round backed by billionaires Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. The round was also joined by new investors including Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Investment Board, Standard Investments, BHP Ventures, Mitsubishi, Sam Altman’s Apollo Projects, and Sarah Kunst’s Cleo Capital. Founded byJeff Jurinak, Josh Goldman, Kurt House, and Kurt Zenz House, KoBold Metals is focused on employing AI to find metals such as cobalt, nickel, copper, and lithium, which are used in manufacturing electric vehicle batteries. “Replacing all gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles is a critical need to avoid catastrophic impacts of climate change. To build the batteries for these vehicles, we need all of the world’s reserves of cobalt, nickel, copper, and lithium plus another $10 trillion of new sources of those metals—an increase in demand of up to 40x over the next 20 years,” the company said on its website. In an interview with Business Insider,a spokesperson for KoBold Metals said:“We are looking for a discovery that will be one of the largest, most significant nickel and cobalt deposits in the world, potentially capable of powering 100 million EVs.” KoBold currently has a team of 30 people, including geologists, geophysicists, and pilots exploring Disko Island and Nuussuaq Peninsula, where the minerals and metals for the batteries and electric vehicles are believed to be in the hills and valleys. The startup is also working in partnership with Bluejay Mining on exploration after CNN first reported the story in a video of the work the KoBold team is doing in Greenland. “Fully electrifying the global economy is our generation’s greatest challenge,” the KoBold spokesperson said. “Partnering with this broad set of world-class investors will accelerate our efforts to find the key materials for the EV revolution.” Starting next summer, the KoBold team in Greenland is planning to useAI to find areas for drilling, according to CNN. Besides, the team is also taking soil samples and using drones and helicopters to scope out the layers below the surface. “It is a concern to witness the consequences and impacts from the climate changes in Greenland,” Bo Møller Stensgaard, CEO of Bluejay Mining, told CNN. “But, generally speaking, climate changes overall have made exploration and mining in Greenland easier and more accessible.”"

That’s not all.The social giant has lost at least $0.5 trillion in market capitalization since it rebranded over a year agoto reflect its focus on themetaverse. But Meta is not throwing the towel. Instead, the company is doubling down and plans to invest $10 billion on its metaverse to reflect the company’s new vision. Last year, Meta said itplansto hire 10,000 people in the European Union to build a “metaverse.” Zuckerberg added that metaverse is a majorinvestment for the company and plays a vital role for the company going forward. To furtherramp up its business and pursue its metaverse ambitions,Meta said on Tuesday it had raised $10 billion in its first-ever bond offering. The new fund will also enable the social giant to buy back some of its struggling shares and build a more traditional balance sheet. Meta is not the only tech company buying back shares.Other big tech companies such as Apple and Intel Corp have also issued bonds recently, raising $5.5 billion and $6 billion, respectively. Although still in a nascent stage, the metaverse can be described as a digital world where the real and virtual worlds converge into a vision of science fiction. You can also think of the metaverse as a virtual world where millions of people could gather to work, play, and socialize in immersive virtual environments and communicate across shared spaces across different platforms. Early this year,Meta also revealed it lost 500,000 daily users. That was not all. The company also reported a declined profit.Zuckerberg blamed the user decline on TikTok, the short video platform we discussed above. With heightening fears of recession and competitive pressures weighing on its digital ads sales,Meta posted a gloomy forecast and recorded its first-ever quarterly drop in revenue. Meanwhile,Facebook’s Meta continues to lose billions in pursuit of the metaverse; already lost $6B on its metaverse project and growing."

The transactions happened earlier this week. Musk’s action to sell Tesla shares contradicted the statement he made just less than four months ago when he said on social media that he had “no further TSLA sales planned” after April 28. Defending his decision to sell another shares of Tesla, Musk said thefunds could be potentially used to finance a potential Twitter deal if he loses a legal battle with the social media platform. When asked by one of his 100 million fans if he was done selling Tesla shares, Musk replied: “Yes. In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don’t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.” Yes.

According to a recentIBM study conducted by the Ponemon Institute,data breaches cost American companies on average more than $8 million per incident, with big breaches (more than 50 million records) costing $388 million. One of the ways to reduce the risks of data breaches is the encryption of sensitive data.Encryption could also be a “safe harbor,” that limits organizations’ exposure to breaches. Although encryption cannot prevent a data breach, however, it can block hackers from accessing sensitive data once it’s stolen, thus mitigating the risk to your organization. Today, there is a plethora of encryption software on the market. But one startup is taking a different approach with the creation ofthe world’s first web3 communications platformdesigned to encrypt the data so that it can be read by who users intend it to. EnterSatellite IM, a Boston-based tech startup and a fully decentralized peer-to-peer voice, video, and text communication platform that stores files on a distributed network so redundancy comes built-in along with large file storage, enabling only intended users to have a secured experience without compromises. “Satellite gives you peace of mind with end-to-end encryption without sacrificing quality,” the startup said on its website. Today, Satellite IM announced it has raised $10.5 million in its seed funding round led by Multicoin Venture Fund and Framework Ventures. The round also saw participation from prominent institutional venture investors including Hashed Venture Fund, IDEO CoLab, Solana Ventures, and Pioneer Square Ventures Fund, among others. Satellite IM is built as an EVM-compatible evolving protocol for simple sovereign storage and peer-to-peer communication, leveraging the interplanetary filesystem (IPFS). The platform allows users to sign, encrypt, broadcast, search, and store documents or messages with decentralized identifiers (DIDs), all while making the need for an existing wallet or on-chain data completely optional. Satellite IM has architected its platform in a developer-friendly modular framework that enables users to build easily on top of the open-source platform, integrating multiple layer one blockchains. “Distributed network technology enables a new era in high fidelity audio and video experience,” said Matthew Wisniewski, Co-Founder and CEO of Satellite IM. “In tandem with our world-class investors and partners, we are at the forefront of user-owned, secure communications. Our peer-to-peer infrastructure and open-source network unlock unlimited community development opportunities.” “Discord is trying to serve too many different types of communities with diverse sets of needs. Satellite is going to serve crypto communities by offering best-in-class crypto-native features, along a credibly-neutral, decentralized back end,” said Kyle Samani, Managing Partner at Multicoin Capital. “We are excited to see Satellite pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the social crypto space,” said Vance Spencer, Co-Founder of Framework Ventures. “We’ve been waiting for someone to build decentralized discord for a long time, and we think Satellite will be able to do it.” Satellite IM’s initial early access launch on its core desktop protocol is scheduled for the Summer of 2022, with a mobile native application launching in the Fall of 2022. Founded this year,Satellite IM is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer voice, video, and text communication platform. Satellite IM enables simple sovereign storage and peer-to-peer communication, leveraging the interplanetary filesystem (IPFS) and dag-jose. Satellite IM’s initial core desktop application, Satellite IM, supports 4K video chat and streaming, lossless audio, and 4GB sharing capabilities, at no cost to the user. Satellite IM’s mobile-native application, Uplink, is scheduled to be released in the Fall of 2022."

2022.8.11,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/11/deliveroo-exits-netherlands-food-delivery-company-continues-bleed-money/,"The ongoing global economic downturn spreading to the food delivery market. With rising inflation and thedisappearance of Covid restrictions of the last two years, fewer people now order food online but instead, buy groceries directly from the local stores. One of the affected food delivery firms is London-based Deliveroo, which sees itsfirst-half losses widen to millions of dollars. In the first six months of this year,Deliveroo reported a pretax loss of £147.3 million ($178 million), up 54% from the same period a year ago.It’s not all bad news for Deliveroo. The company saw its revenues climb 12% to £1 billion. The disappointing result has forced the company to announce plans to exit the Netherlands, which would mark the latest exit from a major European market for the company. According to Deliveroo, the Netherlands represented only 1% of its GTV in the first half of 2022. In a statement,Deliveroo CEO Will Shu said,“So far in 2022, we have made good progress delivering on our profitability plan, despite increased consumer headwinds and slowing growth during the period. We are confident that in H2 2022 and beyond we will see further gains from actions already taken, as well as benefits from new initiatives.” Shu added: “We remain confident in our ability to adapt financially to any further changes in the macroeconomic environment.” The report comes four months after a French court found Deliveroo guilty of abusing freelance status of its riders.As part of the ruling, two former bosses of Deliveroo were also given suspended one-year prison sentences and fined 30,000 euros ($32,380). Founded in 2013 by Will Shu and Greg Orlowski, the London, England-based Deliveroo operates in about 20 countries including Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and the United Kingdom. The startup makes money by charging restaurants a commission fee, as well as by charging customers a fee per order. It currently operates in two hundred cities."

Hacking and data breaches have now become a daily occurrence, and the rate of crypto theft has increased exponentially in recent years as the prices of cryptocurrencies fall from their all-time high. As we reported late last year,hackers and scammers stole over $12 billion in crypto assets in the past decade. But the rate has accelerated this year. In the last seven months alone,hackers have stolen $1.4 billion in crypto assets using crypto bridges. About half of that amount was stolen through RenBridge, according to a report from analytics firm Elliptic.RenBridge chain was singled out partly because the stolen funds were linked to crimes and money laundering. In recent months, the bridges have become a prime target for hackers due to vulnerabilities in their underlying code.In June, hackers stole nearly $100 million worth of crypto assets after Harmony’s Horizon blockchain bridge was exploited. Back in February, we also wrote about the crypto platform Wormhole,a bridge between Solana and other blockchains, afterhackers exploited the Wormhole networkand stole120,000 ETH (around $320 million), making itthe second-largest DeFi hack ever.Blockchain bridges connect networks to enable the fast swaps of tokens. Cross-chain or blockchain bridges allow crypto assets to be transferred between blockchains, without going through a centralized service such as an exchange.With blockchain bridges, crypto users are also able to bypass a centralized exchange that’s largely unprotected. As the need to connect disparate blockchain platforms grows, blockchain bridges have grown in popularity and hackers have perfected the craft of exploiting these blockchain bridges to steal billions in crypto assets. “Our analysis of cross-chain transactions using Elliptic’s new Nexus technology shows that one cross-chain bridge in particular – RenBridge – has been used to launder at least $540 million in crypto assets originating from theft, fraud, ransomware and various other types of criminal activity since 2020, Elliptic said in its report.  According to Elliptic, blockchain bridge hacks have resulted in more than $1.3 billion stolen so far this year. In an interview with CNBC,Elliptic co-founder and chief scientist Tom Robinson said: “Blockchain bridges have become the low-hanging fruit for cyber-criminals, with billions of dollars worth of crypto assets locked within them. These bridges have been breached by hackers in a variety of ways, suggesting that their level of security has not kept pace with the value of assets that they hold.”"

The announcement comes just a few days after the US Treasury put thenotoriouscrypto startup on its sanctions list. In a pressreleaseby the Netherlands Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD), the FIOD arrested a 29-year-old man in Amsterdam on Wednesday 10 August.He is suspected of involvement in concealing criminal financial flows and facilitating money laundering through the mixing of cryptocurrencies through the decentralized Ethereum mixing service Tornado Cash. “Multiple arrests are not ruled out. These advanced technologies, such as decentralised organisations that may facilitate money laundering are receiving extra attention from the FIOD. Also in the cryptocurrency domain, the FIOD stands for a safe financial Netherlands and investigates with effect and impact. Today the suspect is brought before the examining judge,”FIOD said. A crypto mixer, also known as a tumbler or blender, is a service that mixes different streams of potentially identifiable cryptocurrency to improve the anonymity of transactions and harder to trace.Tornado Cash is one of the largest crypto tumblers identified as “notorious” by the U.S. Treasury. In a statement, the US Treasury said: “Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash, which has been used to launder more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its creation in 2019. This includes over $455 million stolen by the Lazarus Group, a Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) state-sponsored hacking group that was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2019, in the largest known virtual currency heist to date. Tornado Cash was subsequently used to launder more than $96 million of malicious cyber actors’ funds derived from the June 24, 2022 Harmony Bridge Heist, and at least $7.8 million from the August 2, 2022 Nomad Heist. Today’s action is being taken pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13694, as amended, and follows OFAC’s May 6, 2022 designation of virtual currency mixer Blender.io (Blender).” Tornado Cash is an Ethereum blockchain-based crypto mixing service that allows users to gain a cloak of anonymity when transferring crypto assets.The U.S. sanctions announced on Monday by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)followed allegations that Tornado Cash was helping conceal billions in capital flows, including for North Korean hackers. In a statement on Friday,The Dutch public prosecutor’s office for serious fraud, environmental crime, and asset confiscation (FIOD) said Tornado was suspected of having laundered more than $7 billion worth of virtual currency since its inception three years ago."

Fast forward almost a year later,Australia’s competition watchdog said on Friday that Google was ordered by the Australian Federal Court to pay A$60 million ($42.7 million) in penalties for misleading users on the collection of their personal location data,Reuters reported. It all started in October 2019 after the watchdog started the proceedings against Google and its local unit. The country’s court later found that Google misled some of its customers about personal location data collected through their Android mobile devices between January 2017 and December 2018. The regulator said that Google took remedial measures in 2018 The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) estimates that 1.3 million Google account users in Australia may have been affected.In an email to Reuters, Google said it had settled the complaints and added it has made location information simple for users to manage and easy to understand. In a statement,the ACCC said thatGoogle misled users into believing the “location history” setting on their android phones was the only way location data could be collected by it when a feature to monitor web and applications activity also allowed local data collection and storage. Google is not new to lawsuits. In June 2020, a $5 billion lawsuit was filed against Google in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California fortracking ‘private’ internet use and violating federal wiretapping and California privacy laws. The complainants accused the Alphabet Inc unit of surreptitiously collecting information about what people view online and where they browse, despite their using what Google calls Incognito mode. While users may view private browsing as a safe haven from watchful eyes, computer security researchers have long raised concern that Google and rivals might augment user profiles by tracking people’s identities across different browsing modes, combining data from private and ordinary internet surfing. The complaint said the proposed class likely includes “millions” of Google users who since June 1, 2016, browsed the internet in “private” mode.It seeks at least $5,000 of damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws."

With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.8.13,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach. Having David Holtzman on board, with his incredible knowledge and world-changing experience makes us feel great about the future of all things digital.” said David Carvalho, CEO, and Founder of Naoris Protocol.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.8.13,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness.

Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good.

Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

Holtzman is an Internet pioneer, a former security analyst, technologist, military code-breaker, futurist, activist, privacy expert, technologist, technology executive, and writer. Over his career life, the initiatives he led have transformed and radically changed the way people interact with technology. Today, blockchain cybersecurity startup Naoris Protocol announced that David H. Holtzman has joined the company in an advisory capacity. Holtzman will support Naoris Protocol in marketing, technology, and strategy, helping the project revolutionize cyber security mitigation with its CyberMesh technology. Holtzman is an early contributor to the technologies that shaped the Internet as we know it today. In the late 1990s, as CTO of Network Solutions, he managed the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS) as well as the ‘Dot’ root server. During his tenure, the number of internet domains skyrocketed from 500,000 to over 20 million. Before Networks Solutions, Holtzman was a Chief Scientist at IBM and ran a major research group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton. He was the CTO of Senator Evan Bayh’s presidential bid and a senior cybersecurity advisor to General Wesley Clarke’s campaign. For the last six years, he’s worked with blockchain companies as a consultant, advisor, or director. In a previous life, Holtzman was a Russian cryptographer deployed on submarines for the US Naval Security Group, later working at the National Security Agency as a Soviet Cosmonaut analyst. Holtzman is a vocal advocate of individuals employing personal cryptography to secure their privacy instead of waiting for the protection of government regulation. He is the author of “Privacy Lost: How Technology is Endangering Your Privacy,” in which he presented a comprehensive insider’s exposé of the world of invasive technology, who’s using it, and how our privacy is at risk. With Holtzman’s support, Naoris Protocol aims to decentralize the cybersecurity practices of modern-day corporations, government agencies, Web3 projects and other entities. As the world transitions to the new Web3 paradigms of DeFi and borderless cryptocurrency, the inefficiency and vulnerabilities of legacy centralized systems threaten global stability. As a representative of an earlier, more radical internet culture, Holtzman is the ideal guiding light for Naoris Protocol. “Naoris Protocol has the right ideas. In my many decades of experience working with disruptive innovators, I’ve come to the conclusion that a company’s most valuable differentiator is the strength of its underlying foundational principles and values. Naoris Protocol has started from a good place and their technology directly aligns with their beliefs. The value of networked decentralization cannot be overemphasized and their novel approach of applying that to security validation is an important one that is likely to be a real game changer.” Holtzman said. “We are so incredibly blessed to be working with David Holtzman as an advisor to the project, we wouldn’t have the internet as we know it today without him and we`re humbled to be splicing together new and highly impactful use cases and ideas with David. This is an exciting, and critical time for Naoris Protocol as we strive to bring the best and most visionary from Web2 and Web3 together to scale our Decentralized CyberSecurity Mesh approach.

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.8.14,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

2022.8.15,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/15/comes-smart-contracts-safer-assets-key-better-dapps/,"Smart contracts have emerged as one of the most fundamental technologies in decentralized networks, forming the basis of today’s growing blockchain industry. It’s smart contracts that allow DeFi applications to process transactions, and NFTs and the metaverse to function in a correct manner. Without them, none of these things would be possible. The technology is based on the idea of a traditional contract that’s agreed upon between two individuals. Such an agreement might stipulate the terms of compensation for an employee who agrees to work for a company. It will state the employee’s obligations and how many hours they are required to work, as well as the salary that person will receive for doing it. Smart contracts are simply more intelligent versions of contracts that don’t require any enforcement. They’re software-based agreements that run on the blockchain and are designed to operate only when certain conditions are met. Because they’re open-source, smart contracts are also transparent, allowing everyone to see the outcome of the transaction they’re programmed to perform. These automated programs are formed on the basis of “if/when… then”, which is a concept that allows them to execute a predetermined action when the stipulated conditions are met. There are numerous advantages to smart contracts. For one thing, they can process transactions instantaneously when conditions are met, meaning they’re far faster than a traditional contract, which requires a human to ascertain that all requirements have been met. They’re also more trustworthy because everyone can see the code and the terms of the agreement before they enter into it. Moreover, because they eliminate the need for an intermediary, they’re also much cheaper, which means transaction fees can be far lower. It’s the automated nature of smart contracts that makes DeFi possible. DeFi refers to a “decentralized finance” industry that excludes banks and traditional financial institutions. Instead, it caters to individuals, who can borrow or loan funds, “stake” tokens for rewards, and engage in yield farming, liquidity provision, and other activities that derive a passive income. Without smart contracts that dictate and enforce the terms of DeFi agreements, the industry simply wouldn’t be able to exist. As good as smart contracts are, the technology is far from perfect. DeFi for sure has a lot of potential and it has generated a great deal of interest, attracting billions of dollars of capital. Yet, it is seen as an incredibly high-risk industry due to the frequent hacks and scams that occur. This year alone, it’s estimated that more than $2 billion has been lost to attacks on DeFi protocols, scams and rug pulls, and misuse of customers’ funds. The vast majority of this money was lost due to vulnerabilities in the smart contracts that are meant to ensure it all works correctly. The biggest problem with smart contracts is that they are, at their core, software programs. As any developer knows, the biggest problem with code is that it’s incredibly vulnerable to bugs and exploits. Smart contract programs are written by human developers. These people are “human” and they’re prone to mistakes. And if a smart contract contains a mistake, it can be exploited by a malicious user to steal funds. Given the billions of dollars worth of value floating around the DeFi ecosystem, it’s an industry that has become a very tempting target for hackers. Unfortunately, most DeFi applications and protocols simply accept the risk that their smart contract code could have vulnerabilities. Of course, they do their best to ensure there are none. Once the code is written, it will undergo an extensive code audit to try and identify any vulnerabilities before the dApp is made available to users. But despite the best efforts of developers and auditors to ensure no bugs are present, there are invariably cases where exploits slip through the cracks, unnoticed until a hacker stumbles upon it. One possible solution proposed by Dr. Lingxiao Jiang, an associate professor of Computer Science at Singapore Management University, is to shift the responsibility for audits away from humans. Instead, he and his team have created artificial intelligence-based machine learning models that attempt to check code for vulnerabilities. These models rely on deep learning techniques to scrutinize smart contracts, checking for any evolutions in programming language rules and bug development. In an academic paper, Dr. Jiang explains that this approach is based on the concept that code and vulnerability patterns, including their syntactical, lexical, and semantic information, may be automatically encoded within numerical vectors through techniques adapted from word embedding. This machine learning-based approach is known as “code-embedding”, and when combined with similarity checking it can be applied to debugging source code and maintaining it through translation and analysis. In this way, it can detect cloned smart contracts, check a smart contract against a database of known exploits, or even identify specific bugs within a group of smart contracts. Dr. Jiang’s team has created a machine learning program called SMART EMBED that’s able to work with Solidity-based smart contacts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for DeFi apps and NFTs. SMART EMBED was trained on more than 50 buggy smart contracts from different sources, before being applied to a sample of more than 22,000 verified Solidity smart contracts, with the results showing encouraging results. The paper demonstrates that SMART EMBED was able to identify cloned smart contracts that had a “similarity ratio” of 90%. It revealed the existence of masses of reused or duplicate code in the smart contracts it checked. Moreover, SMART EMBED was able to over 1,000 bugs in this duplicate code. SMART EMBED was also able to validate the smart contracts by checking to see if they contained bugs similar to existing patterns with low rates of false positives. As encouraging as solutions like SMART EMBED are, even machine learning models are not infallible. For better results, the DeFi industry can benefit from a solution that’s more proactive, as opposed to the reactive idea of simply checking code for vulnerabilities after the fact. This is where the startup Radix may be onto something. It’s taking a far more radical approach to smart contract safety that involves changing the paradigm – it has created an entirely new model for writing smart contracts that automates much of the process through the use of “components” and “blueprints.” Radix is based on the idea that “safer assets equals better dApps” and to that end, it has created a Radix Engine that treats crypto assets such as NFTs and tokens as a central feature within its smart contracts. Using Radix, it’s possible to build dApps using what the startup calls “DeFi Lego bricks”, which are components written with its proprietary Scrypto language. Scrypto is based on the Rust programming language and will be immediately familiar to anyone who’s competent in that language. These components can be thought of as pre-written templates that can be incorporated into DeFi applications, eliminating the need to write smart contracts for each function they perform. More specific kinds of functionality can be embedded into DeFi apps with “blueprints” that modify each of these components, to create extremely customizable dApps. With Radix Engine and Scrypto, developers can leverage trusted resources that ensure the safety and integrity of crypto assets, in order to create the bulk of their dApp code. This means that there is much less scope for vulnerabilities to slip through the net. To incentivize the creation of these components, Radix has even created a developer royalty system, where programmers are able to earn cryptocurrency each time the code they design is implemented in a new dApp. In this way, the Radix community is encouraged to create a public library of components and blueprints that anyone can use. It remains to be seen if Radix’s redesigned blueprint for smart contracts will catch on with a developer community that has largely accepted today’s reactive approach to programming. Nevertheless, it’s an extremely promising solution. Smart contracts are gaining more traction by the day, and not only as tools for financial transactions. Additional promising use cases include automating workflows in business processes and in areas such as manufacturing, for example by triggering actions for managers or machines when specific conditions are met. Smart contracts can play a huge role in advancing automation in multiple industries and businesses. The potential is massive, but it will only ever be realized if safety is built into smart contracts as a core feature, as opposed to being an afterthought like it is today."

The Alphabet-owned YouTubehas renewed talks with entertainment companies about participating in the platform, The Journal said, citing people close to the recent discussions.YouTube hopes the new platform, which it is referring to internally as a “channel store”has been in the works for at least 18 months and could be available as early as this fall, the sources also told The Journal. In recent months, the ultracompetitive U.S. market is prompting streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, and others to seek new ways to find subscribers. For example, Netflix reported a loss of 200,000 subscribers during the first quarter causing the stock to plunge by more than 25% during the market trading session. Then in July,the streaming giant announced a new lower-priced ad-supported subscription plan for consumersas part of its effortto stem the tide of viewers who are opting to unsubscribe from its service. YouTube to join a list of companies like Apple, Hulu, and Roku, looking to gain a portion of the already crowded streaming market. Early this month, the New York Times also reported that Walmart was in talks with media companies about including streaming entertainment in its membership service. Meanwhile, this is welcoming news for consumers as the stranglehold big media outlets have on Americans continues to wane. Back in the summer of 2020, we wrote a piece about a survey from Pew Research which found thatabout a quarter (26%) of U.S. adults now get their news from YouTube. According to anotherreportfrom CNBC, citingYouTube’s chief product officer Neal Mohan, more than 120 million people watched YouTube or YouTube TV on their TV screens in December 2020 as they were spending time at home,up from 100 million in March of last year. The surge in viewership is also a boon for YouTube. In 2020, eMarketer projected U.S. CTV ad spend was $8.11 billion, reaching $18.3 billion by 2024."

The Los Angeles-based electric vehicle startup,which went public in a July 2021 merger with a blank-check company,was hoping to raise $325 million to fund its operation through the end of the year. It appears the startup was able to raise funding from investors after many months of struggle. Today,Faraday Future announced it has successful execution of a definitive agreement for a new financing facility. As part of the new financing agreement, which has total potential funding of as much as $600 million in a convertible secured notes structure, Faraday Future will receive an initial $52 million of committed funds. The funds are managed and led by ATW Partners.”Investors contributing $27 million (plus up to $31 million from additional investors who commit on or prior to August 17, 2022, and fund on or prior to August 19, 2022) will receive a conversion price of $2.2865 per FFIE share, later contributions will receive a conversion price of $2.69 per FFIE share,” the company said in a press release on Monday. To furtherramp up its production through the end of the year and beyond, Faraday Future says itremains in active discussions with both U.S. institutional investors and international funding sources. “I am very pleased to have this important new committed capital and framework in place for substantial additional funding. We are working diligently to complete this capital raise process in order to raise sufficient new funds to launch the FF 91. Subject to successful completion of this fundraising process, I am confident that we can deliver cars to our customers in late Q3 or Q4.” said Dr. Carsten Breitfeld, Global CEO of Faraday Future. Dr. Breitfeld added, “Our Hanford manufacturing facility, recently renamed the “FF ieFactory California” is nearing completion. We have all the equipment on site needed to begin production and are in the final stages of installation. The FF ieFactory California has already produced over a dozen production-intent vehicles. Testing and validation of the FF 91 is well underway, and I am very pleased with the results we are seeing. The FF 91 will be the world’s first ultra-luxury EV and will reset customer expectations for what the future of intelligent mobility can be.” We covered Faraday Future over a year ago after it announced itsplans to go public via SPAC. A few months later, Faraday Future went public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp in July 2021. In March 2021. the EV startup came under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation for making inaccurate statements to its investors. The SEC subpoenaed some members of its management team as part of a probe into inaccurate statements made to its investors, according to areportfrom Reuters. Meanwhile, Faraday Future’s former CEO Jia Yueting filed for chapter 11 personal bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2019 and now serves as chief product and ecosystem officer at the company.The startup also said that it would miss the deadline for filing its 2021 annual report due to delays caused by the internal investigation.  Founded in 2014,Faraday Future is a pre-production EV startup companydeveloping global solutions that re-imagine transportation, content, and ownership. The startup once promised to start making and selling its so-called flagship FF91 SUV as early as 2018, but it has been forced to postpone the delivery of its first mass-market production several times."

As the layoff number rises, more tech companies said they are also planning to trim their workforces to counter market challenges amid the global economic downturn. As The Great Resignation turns intoThe Great Attrition, 40 percent of global workers are considering quitting their jobs.The question many are asking is: Where are the laid-off workers going? Now, a new survey from Digital.com provides more insights and sheds more light on where they are going. With fears of layoffs and the economy sinking into recession, Digital.com wanted to find out how workers who have already been laid off this year are handling an unpredictable job market.Digital.com surveyed 1,250 workers who were laid off in 2022 and the findings were shocking. • 1 in 10 plan to start their own business instead of returning to the workforce as an employee • 50% say they will fund their new company with a small business loan • 50% plan to fund their venture with small business loans • 4 in 5 are somewhat or very concerned about starting a new business while inflation remains high • Instead of returning to the workforce, 1 in 10 plan to start their own business, despite inflation and the possibility of a recession • Despite 4 in 5 expressing concern about the economy, many also stated they do not have a backup plan in place The majority of workers who were laid off in 2022 do not plan to get another job in the same industry. 49% of respondents said they plan to find another job in their field, 29% plan to find a job in a different field, 10% will start their own business, and just 6% say they will go back to school instead.  The most common industries survey respondents reported being laid off from included retail (21%), service and hospitality (12%), healthcare (10%), and manufacturing (9%). Additionally, of the laid-off workers who plan to start their own business, close to two-thirds say their new business will be in a different industry. “Try to get some real-world experience in the industry [before starting your business],” advised small business consultant Dennis Consorte. “You can either take on a part-time job to get your feet wet, or you can explore the industry as a customer.” “You don’t have to actually buy anything. But, you can pay attention to industry trends, the customer experience in different retail shops and online, and what you like or don’t like about competitor products.” When respondents were asked why they wanted to start their own business instead of going back to work, the top answers given were to make more money (57%) and to pursue a passion (56%). “No matter what you pursue, it should be something that you’re excited about,” continued Consorte. “If you lack the passion when you start out, then it’s likely you’ll burn out before the business becomes a success. If you haven’t worked in the field, then learn as much as you can before you start your business. You can spend hours diving into industry publications, websites, and online videos to get some background.”  You can view the full report here."

Then in May,the Chinese governmentshowed signs of easing its crackdown on the country’s tech sector. But little has changed. As we reported last month,Alibaba founder Jack Ma was forced to give up control of China’s fintech giant Ant Groupas part of the effort to move away from affiliate Alibaba Group Holding “after more than a year of extraordinary pressure from Chinese regulators. Jack Ma is not alone.China’s Tencent Holdings is also planning to sell all or bulk of its $24 billion stake in food delivery company Meituan to appease the Chinese regulators and monetize its eight-year-old investment, Reuters reported, citing four sources with knowledge of the matter. The planned sale comes against the backdrop of China’s sweeping regulatory crackdown since late 2020 on technology heavyweights that took aim at their empire building via stake acquisitions and domestic concentration of market power. “The regulators are apparently not happy that tech giants like Tencent have invested in and even become a big backer of various tech firms that run businesses closely related to people’s livelihoods in the country,” one of the sources told Reuters. Three sources also told Reuters thatTencent, which owns 17% of Meituan, has been engaging with financial advisers in recent months to work out how to execute a potentially large sale of its Meituan stake. In May 2021,Meituan lost $38.96 billionof its value after the Chinese government’s antitrust crackdown wiped off over $250 billion from Chinese tech stocks. Then in October 2021,China’s top antitrust bodyfined Meituan more than $533 million for engaging in anti-competitive practices. The fine brought an end to a yearlong regulatory crackdown at China’s biggest provider of food delivery and related services.“We accept the penalty with sincerity,” Meituan said. Meituan was founded in 2010 by Wang Xing. It was one of China’s most popular internet startups.Meituan-Dianping is a daily deal site for locally found consumer products and retail services. In addition to its food delivery service, Meituan also offers deals of the day by selling vouchers for local services and entertainment."

In 2019,WeWorkfired its CEO Adam Neumann, canceled its IPO, and laid off a quarter of its 12,500 employees. But not so fast.Adam Neumann is back again with his new venture. Nearly three years after Adam Neumann was let go from WeWork following a failed attempt to take the company public, he now once again trying to run another billion-dollar real estate startup. It’s like WeWork but for apartments. And high-profile investors already pouring millions of dollars intoNeumann’s new startup. Andreessen Horowitz, the prominent venture capital firm known for its early investments in Airbnb and Twitter, has reportedly pumped about $350 million into Neumann’s newest venture, called Flow, according to The New York Times, citing unnamed sources briefed on the deal. The funding valued the new startup at more than $1 billion, according to the report. Flow is “effectively a service that landlords can team up with for their properties, somewhat similar to the way an owner of a hotel might contract with a branded hotel chain to operate the property,”The New York Times reported. In a blog post on Monday, Andreessen Horowitz cofounder and general partner Marc Andreessen also confirmed the investment, without disclosing financial details. Andreessen also explained his thinking for backing Flow, a residential real estate company, and Neumann despite the founder’s high-profile fall from grace at WeWork. “Adam is a visionary leader who revolutionized the second largest asset class in the world — commercial real estate — by bringing community and brand to an industry in which neither existed before,” Andreessen said. “Adam, and the story of WeWork, have been exhaustively chronicled, analyzed, and fictionalized — sometimes accurately. For all the energy put into covering the story, it’s often underappreciated that only one person has fundamentally redesigned the office experience and led a paradigm-changing global company in the process: Adam Neumann.” It’s still unclear how Flow seeks to revolutionize the residential housing industry. The startup currently has a bare-bones website, with the slogan “Live life in flow” and two words stating it will launch in 2023. Andreessen positioned the new company as a long-awaited solution to the nation’s “housing crisis.” He used a mix of jargon-filled terms — “community-driven, experience-centric service” — to explain how the new startup would “create a system where renters receive the benefits of owners.” “We think it is natural that for his first venture since WeWork, Adam returns to the theme of connecting people through transforming their physical spaces and building communities where people spend the most time: their homes,” Andreessen wrote. “Residential real estate — the world’s largest asset class — is ready for exactly this change.” Under Neumann’s leadership, WeWork expanded from shared coworking spaces with elaborate perks to experimenting with gyms, a school, and housing. The last of those efforts, called WeLive, let customers rent a bed or private room in a coliving location, with common spaces available for yoga, ping-pong, and more. Since its founding in 2010, WeWork raised a staggering $12.8 billion in funding over 14 rounds.In 2019, the startup formally withdrew the S-1 filing and postponed its IPO."

Today, nuclear power currently provides about 20 percent of US electricity— and 50 percent of its carbon-free electricity, according todatafrom the US Energy Information and Administration (EIA). However, what’s rarely discussed is the overall energy lifecycle orLife Cycle Analysis (LCA). Just like other energy sources, nuclear plants produce waste while generating electricity. After the energy is generated, most of the radioactivity associated with nuclear power remains contained in the fuel in which it was produced. This waster is classified as high-level radioactive waste, a type of hazardous waste that contains radioactive material. Unknown to millions of Americans,there is currently no permanent nuclear waste depository in the United States. Instead, nuclear waste is stored in dry casks at the locations of currently operating and former nuclear power plants around the country.  The United States is not alone.Around the world, about 490,000 metric tons of radioactive spent fuel is temporarily stored in pools and dry casks above ground. No spent nuclear fuel anywhere in the world has yet been placed in a permanent repository. Now, one California-based tech startup is on a mission to change that for the better. Enter Curio, a New York-basednuclear waste recycling startupfocused on commercializing the case for a closed fuel cycle with nuclear waste recycling and unleashing the full potential of the atom.From closing the cycle to the production of proliferation-hardened alternative fuels for its current fleet of reactors, advanced reactors, nuclear medicine, deep space applications, and advanced batteries,Curios is unleashing the full potential of the atom. “The United States generates about 2,000 metric tons of new nuclear waste per year, adding to the approximately 86,000 tons that are already generated. Reprocessing nuclear waste is one way to make it less radioactive, but there’s only enough capacity in the world to reprocess 2,400 tons per year, and most of that is in France (1,700 metric tons) and Russia (400 metric tons).” Founded in 2020 byRabbi Yechezkel Moskowitz, Curio specializes in clean energy, a substantially lower environmental footprint, and advanced medicine. In January, Curio appointedEd McGinnisto become its CEO. McGinnis worked for the Department of Energy from 1991 to 2021 and he knows firsthand about the nuclear waste problem in the United States. In an interview with CNBC,McGinnis said the company aims to solve the nuclear waste problem for the United States while also making valuable products out of the used fuel, including fuel for next-generation reactors and isotopes valuable for space batteries and medical processes, to name a few examples. McGinnis told CNBC that the ten-person startup is planning to have a pilot facility up and running in six years and a commercial nuclear waste reprocessing facility up and running by 2035. Curio’s commercial plant will have a capacity of 4,000 metric tons when fully built out. It will cost $5 billion to build and it will be about the size of an NFL football stadium. “We would take title of all 86,000 metric tons and the federal government and the public would never see that high level radioactive material on their books again, we would take the burden of it,” McGinnis said. “And we would take trash and turn it into products and treasures. That’s our business line.” Unlike the existing process called PUREX (plutonium uranium reduction extraction),“which among other things separates and extracts plutonium in a pure stream,” which can be a problem under nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaties,Curio’s technology will be different. “We have a process where we never separate out pure plutonium,” McGinnis said. “We’re never going to do that because we want to have a proliferation security-hardened process. We have self-protection built in.” Meanwhile, Ashutosh Goel, a Rutgers professor who has done research on dealing with nuclear waste with a process called “immobilization” said Curio’s goals are formidable. “Yes, what Curio is targeting is ambitious. However, isn’t that the case with anything in nuclear energy?” Goel told CNBC. “If we are serious about reducing the carbon footprint and still meeting the energy demands of the nation, we cannot accomplish this goal without nuclear energy.” Curios is one of the handfuls of startups solving the nuclear waste problem.Deep Isolation is another tech startup founded by a daughter-father team aiming to bury and safely dispose of nuclear waste.Unlike the current approach,Deep Isolation’s nuclear waste solutions offer an engineered system that isolates waste from the biosphere."

Fink reiterated the similar message in his 2020annual letter to CEOs thatthe next 1000 billion-dollar start-ups will be those “that help the world decarbonize and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers.”Now BlackRock is investing in clean energy startupsas part of its renewable energy push. In an announcement Tuesday, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock said it is investing $700 million (1 billion Australian dollars) in Australian battery storage startupAkaysha Energy “to support the build-out” of more than 1 gigawatt of battery storage assets.The investment came from the real estate and infrastructure investment arm of BlackRock.BlackRock added that the fund has agreed to acquire Akaysha Energy, which develops energy storage and renewable energy projects. As countries around the world transition to renewable energy, effective, large-scale storage systems are becoming increasingly critical to store excess energy generated by wind and solar sources. According to the IEA, investment in battery storage grew by nearly 40% in 2020, reaching $5.5 billion.The International Energy Agency has said that a “rapid scale-up of energy storage is critical to meet flexibility needs in a decarbonized electricity system.” Founded in 2021,Akaysha Energy’s mission is to unlock the energy future in order to drive decarbonization, which means green, reliable, and affordable energy solutions in the NEM and globally. Akaysha currently has nine projects in development that it wants to put into Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM). BlackRock will commit the billion-dollar funding into that pipeline, which the company said totals 1GW of battery storage. That gigawatt of storage could enable the addition of around four times as much new renewable energy capacity onto the grid through managing the variability of wind and solar PV, BlackRock said. “The Asia-Pacific region is at the dawn of its energy transition from carbon-emitting fossil fuels to intermittent renewable resources and we believe a successful shift to a more sustainable energy future is dependent on the use of large-scale battery storage,” Akaysha Managing Director Nick Carter said, adding that Akaysha will be able to leverage BlackRock’s “global capabilities and track record in climate infrastructure.” Currently,fossil fuels accounted for 76% of electricity generation in 2020 in Australia, 54% from coal, 20% from gas, and 2% from oil. The country istargeting 80% renewable energy by 2030 and various studies have shown a growing need for energy storage to enable its integration. BlackRock is the world’s most influential financial company with$9 trillion in assets under managementas of June 2021.

Tournament Wearables can only be used within SNG tournaments, Flex Wearables only on the ICE Poker Flex App, and All Access Wearables can be used in both Decentraland and the Flex app. Each tournament entry requires a certain amount of Shine on their wearable, which can be refilled using ICE tokens. Different tournaments and events will have different Shine requirements, while the number of Tournament Badges they’ll win is equal to how much Shine they used. The entry requirements on Sit-n-Go tournaments are much lower than on the standard Challenge mode, allowing skilled players without major capital to start playing with a Tournament Wearable, prove their worth, and graduate to Flex or the All Access Wearable. For the ICE Poker community, SNG tournaments are an additional use case and source of demand for the ICE token. Part of the ICE used for Shine is burned, instead of being redistributed to winners, which serves as a sustainable token sink for the game economy.  Commenting on the release,Matthew Howells-Barby, CMO at Decentral Games, said:“We’ve listened to our community, many of whom became priced out by our regular wearables. We wanted to create a fast-paced ‘entry level’ circuit of tournaments, which is why we developed Sit-n-Go. Thanks to the blinds and the ability to play on mobile, it’s guaranteed to be fast-paced and action-packed. Players can refine their craft and eventually accumulate enough to obtain the coveted All-Access Wearable.” Powered by the Ethereum blockchain, Decentralandis thefirst decentralized metaverse that is built, governed, and owned by its users. The most popular game on Decentraland is Decentral Games, the play-and-earn gaming project launched in October 2021 that now accounts for ~60% of all traffic within the Decentraland metaverse."
2022.8.18,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/18/crypto-lender-genesis-lays-off-20-workforce-ceo-departs/,"Crypto broker Genesis is the latest casualty of a $2 trillion digital-asset market wipeout following its exposure to the now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. On Wednesday,Genesis announced its CEO Michael Moro is stepping down and the company is cutting 20% of its 260-person workforceor 52 jobs. Derar Islim, who joined Genesis in 2020 and has overseen the development of strategy and key core functions, will take over as interim CEO while the company searches for a permanent replacement, the company said in astatement. The layoffs were announced as part of the firm’s leadership changes that resulted in the departure of Moro. The announcement comes a fewweeks after it was revealed in court filings that the crypto lending firm lent $2.4 billion to the beleaguered Three Arrows Capital. In addition, Genesis has made key executive leadership hires to further strengthen its governance and position the firm for the future. Chief Risk Officer Michael Patchen, Chief Compliance Officer Michael Patterson, and Chief Technology Officer Matthew Johnson have recently joined Genesis. Alice Chan, Chief Financial Officer, and Arianna Pretto-Sakmann, Chief Legal Officer, round out the expanded leadership team focused on strengthening the company’s overall risk management in partnership with Genesis’ sales and trading leadership. “Our clients look to Genesis to provide integral capital and execution services across their digital asset portfolios,” said Derar Islim, Interim Chief Executive Officer. “The changes and investments we’re announcing today affirm our commitment to operational excellence as we continue to expand our services to meet the needs of our clients today and into the future.” “I’m thrilled to join the Genesis Board. I also look forward to working with Derar and the team to bolster key areas of Genesis and to expand the firm’s market position with more traditional financial institutions and alternative asset managers looking for investment opportunities in digital assets,” said Tom Conheeney, Genesis’ Senior Advisor. “Since we launched the first OTC bitcoin trading desk in 2013, sophisticated investors have come to Genesis to provide liquidity, lending, and custody services for their digital assets. It has been an honor to lead Genesis for nearly a decade and I look forward to supporting the company’s next phase of growth,” said Michael Moro. Genesis is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, the crypto investor and conglomerate founded by Barry Silbert. Since its launch a few years ago, Genesis has emerged as a leading digital asset trading and lending firm with hundreds of institutional clients around the world The firm was early in the market, launching the first over-the-counter crypto trading desk in 2013, and then expanding to become a major lender.During the 2021 crypto boom, Genesis originated more than $131 billion in loans. The company also increased its headcount by 22% to 170 employees. By mid-2022, that number had increased to 260. Three Arrows’ margin call has already rippled through the entire crypto market. One of the affected crypto companies is crypto lender BlockFi, which recently announcedthat it has liquidated its position in Three Arrows In June, the embattledThree Arrows Capital was ordered into liquidation by a court in the British Virgin Islands.Bloomberg also reported that the firm is now planning to sell its asset including holdings in crypto startups."

2022.8.19,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/19/sofy-raises-7-75-million-to-grow-its-no-code-mobile-app-testing-platform/,"Software engineers andcitizen developers continue to embrace the no-code software revolution abut two decadesafter the no-code web development platforms helped kickstart the no-code movement. At its core, the goal is to democratize software development and level the development playing field for everyone by lowering the barrier to entry of digitization. So far, there are at least two-dozenno-code development platforms that allow developers andnon-developers alike to createpowerful websites and web apps. One of the leading no-code platforms isSofy, a Seattle, Washington-based no-code test automationplatform for mobile apps. The startup helpssoftware developers to accelerate their product release times by 95 percent. Unlike the traditional way of writing code to automate testing, Sofy leverages the power of AI to create resilient, no-code automation so QA teams can focus on testing. Today, Sofy announced it has raised $7.75 million in seed funding led by Voyager Capital with participation from PSL Ventures, GTMFund, Revolution, and others.Sofy will use the funding proceeds to accelerate its growth and augment its signature no-code test automation platform for mobile apps, web applications, and APIs. Sofy is currently used by tech giants including Microsoft, Alight, and other enterprise customers – in addition to 15,000 users worldwide – to give their developers 10x faster quality assurance testing without the need to write a single line of code. “Traditional software testing is manual and slow,” said Syed Hamid, Sofy founder and CEO. “No-code test automation for mobile apps is a sea change for developers, cutting weeks from quality assurance (QA) schedules and freeing developers to focus on better apps. The funding allows us to grow aggressively beyond the 15,000 engineers and QA testers who have already deployed our product. Which is quite remarkable since we’ve already scaled quickly, on a bootstrap budget, due to our unique insights from decades working in this space coupled with incredible market demand.” Sofy was founded in 2016 by Syed Hamid and includes other key executives such as Hyder Ali, VP product and business development; and Usman Zubair, VP Engineering. Prior to founding Sofy, Syed was an engineering leader at Microsoft for almost two decades, where he led testing and engineering teams across numerous geographies. “No-code test automation is transforming the $4B mobile application testing market and bringing tremendous gains to the software development and deployment process. Syed and his team invented the category years ago,” said James Newell, Managing Director at Voyager Capital. “Application developers no longer need to make the unenviable choice between waiting on their QA team, writing custom testing scripts or simply shipping without proper testing. Sofy allows them to ship better code, faster without taxing scarce engineering teams.” Sofy’s no-code test automation platform frees developers from writing automation code, so instead they can focus on building applications and services rather than infrastructure for testing. AI is used to improve test automation resiliency, so every member of the team can run those tests on hundreds of devices, generating results in minutes. “There are more than 7M apps across iOS and Android platforms and each one must be tested before it ships on countless devices and multiple operating systems,” said Syed. “No-code test automation for mobile apps saves millions of dollars in manual testing and frees overburdened engineering teams to write business logic that actually makes money for their company.”"
2022.8.19,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/19/global-funding-web3-startups-fell-92-7-since-last-quarter-2021/,"The current economic downturn and the looming recession here in the United States have caused global funding to startups to fall by 23% in the second quarter of 2011 from the first, to $108.5 billion, according to data from CB Insights. The impact is even greater for web3 startups. The crypto bear market and soft sales in the NFT market also led to a slowdown in the funding of crypto and web3 companies. According to an analysis by BanklessTimes.com, web3 startup funding has seen a 92.7%decline since the last quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, web3 startups raised a total of $9.8 billion through various funding rounds. However, in the third quarter of this year, that number dropped to just $ 719.7 million. In a statement,BanklessTimes CEO Jonathan Merry says,” The web3 startup ecosystem is in the early stages of development, and valuations are still being determined. Investors are becoming more cautious and are holding back on investments until they see more progress from these startups.” One of the main reasons for this decline may be the bearish turn that the crypto market has taken since the beginning of the year. The price of Bitcoin, which is often seen as an indicator of the health of the crypto market, has dropped by more than 50% since January. This has made it difficult for web3 startups to raise money through initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other forms of cryptocurrency-based fundraising. Web3 startups face many challenges when it comes to fundraising. However, there have been some bright spots at the end of July. One of the most notable success stories is Unstoppable Domains, a blockchain startup that provides users with censorship-resistant domain names. Unstoppable Domains announced it achieved unicorn status after raising $65 million in a Series B funding round led by Pantera Capital with participation from several angel investors. With this latest round of funding, Unstoppable Domains plans to expand its team and continue to build its censorship-resistant domain name system. With the bearish turn of the crypto market and increasing regulatory scrutiny, it will be interesting to see how web3 startup funding trends develop over the rest of the year. If the crypto market can rebound and regulatory clarity is achieved, we may see more web3 startups attracting investment. However, if the current trends continue, web3 startups will need to find ways to adapt to the changing market conditions if they want to survive. You can read the full report and statistics here."

With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.8.20,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."
2022.8.20,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/whistleblower-says-twitter-lied-elon-musk-spam-bots-boost-musks-ongoing-legal-battle-reports/,"Yesterday, we covered a story from The Washington Post about the former Twitter head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko’s claim that the social giant misled regulators about spam accounts and buried ‘egregious deficiencies.’ In a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

2022.8.21,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/australia-based-lumachain-lands-19-5m-transform-1-5-trillion-meat-industry-change-food-produced-good/,"The world’s food supply chain is broken and Sydney, Australia-basedLumaChain has a plan to fix it. With globalization, it’s almost impossible to trace the origins of the food we eat. In addition,the $1.5 trillion global meat industry also has an ugly track record when it comes to labor abuses. LumaChain is a food supply chain tech startup on a mission to bring transparency to global supply chains, benefitting producers, enterprises, and consumers, while also helping to end modern slavery.Its goal is nothing less than to transform the global food industry, with technology that enables a better, safer, and more sustainable supply chain, the company says on its website. The idea for Lumachain started as a conversation around a dining table with friends in the meat processing industry. During the conversation, “one of the groups was explaining that global meat supply chains were fundamentally broken because there was no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the original animal it came from,”Lumachain founder and CEO Jamila Gordon explains.Jamila was aSomali native who went to Australia as a displaced person during the Somali Civil War. For five decades, the meatindustry had been trying to solve this problem. It was an aha moment for Jamila and immediately reminded her of how she had built the Qantas Airways spare parts tracking system, and “because there is nothing that makes Jamila happier than solving hard problems – she decided to solve this one, too!” Fast forward a few years later,Lumachain helps major players in the sector to track and trace the origin, location, and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real-time, from farm to fork. This incentivizes farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products. Using blockchain, IoT, and artificial intelligence, the Lumachain platform is disrupting the traditional enterprise supply chains to provide transparency, safety & trust throughout the supply chain.Lumachain has grown exponentially since its inception four years ago. The startup uses its algorithms to connect broken links in the supply chain and allow partners to conduct business in a secure ecosystem, Smart-tags, IoT & sensors allow individual items to be tracked, including history, location, and conditions.  Today,Lumachain announced it has raised $19.5 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners with participation from existing investor Main Sequence. In conjunction with the funding, Lumachain also announced its first U.S. headquarters in Denver, Colorado. The company will use the funding proceeds to accelerate the rollout of its world-first computer vision-based artificial intelligence platform at meat and food processing plants across the U.S. and globally. In addition, Lumachain will significantly scale up its team of computer vision and software engineers, and delivery and product experts from the meat industry. Over the next 12 months, the company expects to increase its U.S. team to approximately 30 personnel, as part of a global team of more than 100. Australian CEO and Founder Jamila Gordon will be based in Denver to scale up its U.S. team as it continues to roll out the platform to customers. “Lumachain’s mission is to transform the global meat industry, for the good of our customers, their employees, and the planet. Today’s investment accelerates our ability to achieve this mission,” said Gordon. “Our computer vision artificial intelligence platform represents a huge step forward for the industry. Built-in close partnership with the world’s leading meat and food processors, it creates a safer environment for workers, safer and higher quality food, and end-to-end transparency across the protein supply chain, driving improved ESG and environmental outcomes.” Lumachain is digitizing the US$1.5 trillion global meat industry, to change how the world’s food is produced for good. Historically, the industry lacked visibility and data in plant operations and across the entire protein supply chain. The industry also suffers a severe worker shortage, and while plant operators are committed to embracing innovation, until now the technology options to do so have been limited, leading to incremental rather than transformational change. The Lumachain technology platform transforms how meat and food processing plants operate to improve food safety and employee safety, as well as increase yields and quality. Lumachain’s platform also drives improved Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes, including improved animal wellbeing and end-to-end traceability data to enable positive change throughout the meat supply chain. The company’s unique ability to connect individual cuts of meat back to the animal they came from, and forward to the box they’re packed into, allows retailers and quick service restaurants to capture provenance and ESG information and share this with consumers to inform purchasing decisions. Lumachain also enables ranchers and other producers to be rewarded for producing high-quality meat and embracing sustainable practices. “We’re excited to partner with Lumachain to support their continued expansion, as they transform the global meat industry,” said Tess Hatch, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. “Their technology platform and deep customer relationships are an impressive achievement already, at a time when innovation and ESG are top of mind in industry and society. We look forward to partnering in Lumachain’s continuing success.” Foundation customers include world-leading meat processors Cargill, OSI, and others, who together provide a significant proportion of the world’s beef, chicken, and pork. Another key customer is Coles, Australia’s second-largest supermarket chain. “We’re embracing cutting-edge technology and innovation across our protein supply chain. Lumachain is a key part of our efforts, and helps support some of the biggest challenges at our production facilities by using computer vision and artificial intelligence to drive efficiencies, create a safer work environment, improve the consistency and quality of our products and enable a more sustainable environment,” said Hans Kabat, president for Cargill’s North American protein business. “Ultimately, our goal is to make our people safe, our plants more efficient and our customers more successful.” “Through Lumachain’s AI technology and solutions, OSI is expanding our innovation to ensure we consistently remain a leader in food safety, quality standards, and operations excellence,” said Mark Richardson, Senior EVP International Division, OSI Group. “We are also proud to use Lumachain’s digitization platform, which allows us to evolve our whole of life traceability to the world’s leading food brands we support.” “Coles are partnering with Lumachain to strengthen the use of data and insights throughout the whole supply chain, from paddock to plate,” said Martin Smithson, General Manager of Meat at Coles. “Traceability through the end-to-end meat supply chain is an important part of Coles’ sustainability strategy, and we’re excited about the opportunity to leverage Lumachain’s cutting-edge computer-vision technology.” Founded in 2018 by Australian national Jamila Gordon, the Lumachain platform offers customers five core modules: safety, yield, quality, efficiency, and traceability. Its team of over 40 software and computer vision engineers, and product and delivery experts spans the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Australia. Lumachain currently has contracts with customers across the U.S., Australia, Europe, and Asia. Lumachain operates from headquarters in Sydney and Denver. The company was recognized as a Rising Star as part of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 list."
2022.8.21,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/25/amazon-shutting-amazon-care-telehealth-service-launched-just-three-years-ago/,"In July, we wrote about Amazon after the retail giantacquired primary health care provider One Medical for about $3.9 billion in cash as part of its plans to make inroads into the $3 trillion healthcare industry. Just a month later, it now appears the retail behemoth might be making a major retreat in its efforts to break into the health care space. Today, Amazon announced it’s shutting down Amazon Care, atelehealth service the company founded three years ago. According to an internal memo sent to employees on Wednesday, the company said it“will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” In a company email,Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay announced Wednesday that the e-commerce giant decided to make the move after determining it wasn’t “the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers,” “We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters,” Lindsay wrote. He also added, “One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022.” Amazon Care was launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in and around the company’s Seattle headquarters.The plan’s care team is made up of doctors, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses. According to its website, Amazon Care offers services including everyday health, urgent care, and virtual urgent care visits, as well as free telehealth consults and in-home visits for a fee from nurses for testing and vaccinations, travel consultations, and general health questions. Telehealth services experienced a boom during the covid pandemic when most people were unable to leave their homes. The demand has since declined as more patients opted for in-person doctor visits. Below’s the entire memo Amazon sent to employees. “Health Services team, We are working on an important, missionary opportunity. Our vision is to make it easier for people to access the health care products and services they need to get and stay healthy. We know accomplishing this won’t be easy or fast, but we believe it matters. One of the ways we’ve worked towards this vision for the past several years has been with our urgent and primary care service offering, Amazon Care. During that time, we’ve gathered and listened to extensive feedback from our enterprise customers and their employees, and evolved the service to continuously improve the experience for customers. However, despite these efforts, we’ve determined that Amazon Care isn’t the right long-term solution for our enterprise customers, and have decided that we will no longer offer Amazon Care after December 31, 2022. This decision wasn’t made lightly and only became clear after many months of careful consideration. Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care, it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term. Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what’s needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers. You’ve heard me say it before, but I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes. However, none of these reasons make this decision any easier for the teams that have helped to build Amazon Care, or for the customers our Care team serves. Our priority right now is to support you, regardless of the path you take. Many Care employees will have an opportunity to join other parts of the Health Services organization or other teams at Amazon — which we’ll be discussing with many of you shortly — and we’ll also support employees looking for roles outside of the company. To the Amazon Care and Care Medical teams, thank you for all of your hard work over these last several years. You should be very proud of what this team has been able to accomplish in a short period of time. I am also thankful to our members and business customers for entrusting us with their care; this is not a responsibility we take lightly. As we take our learnings from Amazon Care, we will continue to invent, learn from our customers and industry partners, and hold ourselves to the highest standards as we further help reimagine the future of health care. Sincerely, Neil”"

About one man in 41 will die of prostate cancer.Prostate cancer can be a serious disease without early diagnosis and treatment. It’s for this reason one startup has made it its mission toadvance the early detection and treatment of prostate cancer. EnterAvenda Health,an AI healthcare startup company creating the future of personalized prostate cancer care by innovating detection and treatment for prostate cancer care.Avenda Health’s technology leverages machine learning to map cancer and real-time sensing to deliver precise interventions in a doctor’s office.Using AI and two needles, a laser, and a sensor, a physician can use Avenda Health technology to ablate tissue with precision and monitor treatment progress in real-time. Today, Avenda Health announced it has raised $10M in Series B funding to accelerate the use of iQuest, an AI-enabled patient management software that identifies and visualizes a patient’s prostate cancer.The round wasled by VCapital, with participation from Plug & Play Ventures and Wealthing VC Club. The funding will also be used to continue clinical evidence development. Founded in 2017 by CEO and co-founder Shyam Natarajan,Brit Berry-Pusey, Ph.D. (COO),Leonard S. Marks, MD (CMO), the Santa Monica-basedAvenda Health usesdeep learning to map a patient’s cancer in 3D, giving physicians precise information and the confidence to make care decisions. Avenda Health has introduced technology that is innovating the men’s health industry to improve treatment and cancer mapping for prostate cancer care. The Avenda Health FocalPoint System powered by iQuest reimagines laser ablation with a system to treat prostate cancer in-office under ultrasound guidance while preserving the quality of life. The system spares healthy tissue by targeting only the tumor, which minimizes side effects, and uses patient-specific information and AI to deliver a precise and personalized treatment. To better predict the extent of disease and support decision-making in cancer care, Avenda Health developed iQuest, which uses AI-deep learning to uncover cancer previously hidden within traditional MRI mapping and can be used by physicians to better plan treatments. “Our company’s mission is to provide clinicians and their patients greater access to care while maintaining the quality of life that is often missing in prostate cancer treatment. Our technology is solving key issues in men’s health and we look forward to creating real change in prostate cancer care,” said Dr. Natarajan. “This funding will play a critical role in expanding the capability and reach of our technology while adding to our experienced team of Urology, medical device, and AI leaders.” At the 2022 American Urological Association annual meeting, a retrospective study of 50 patients showed iQuest improved tumor encapsulation1 over conventional treatment planning from 56 percent to 80 percent2. In 2021, the company received Breakthrough Device Designation FDA clearance for the Avenda Health Focal Therapy System. The system was also voted the “Most Promising Ablative Technology” at FOCAL 2020: Focal Therapy Gauntlet, attended by top urologists from around the country. “We are thrilled to be a part of Avenda Health’s journey in making incredible strides in the future of prostate cancer care, ” said Ryan Kole, Partner at VCapital. “Investing in something meaningful, innovative, and groundbreaking in men’s health is something VCapital is proud of.” FocalPoint is FDA cleared for soft tissue ablation. iQuest and its use with FocalPoint are not FDA-cleared and are for investigational use only."

Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users. Musk, on the other hand, thinks the figure is much higher. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate. Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%.

The United States is alone.Workers in Europe are also quitting their jobs in search of more flexible conditions. As European employers face the challenge of hiring qualified workers and the demand for tech talent soars,one Bulgaria-basedjob matching startup called nPloy is aiming to transform the European recruitment market around andtransforms the way employers and candidates find the perfect match. nPloy is an online platform that directly matches and connects candidates and employers based on the dating apps model. The platform has already attracted more than 85,000 candidates and 500 employers on the Bulgarian and Romanian market, and now aims to expand. Today, nPloy announcedit has raised €2 million in first investment roundto start transforming the recruitment market in Europe. The round wasled by the local VC firm “Morningside Hill” setting the goal of expanding the platform to Central and East European countries. Founded in 2018 byco-founder Konstantin Tsonev, nPloy is a mobile app that provides job seekers with job search and offers human resources, staffing & recruiting services to organizations.The app’s smart algorithm shows the candidates only job ads that meet all their requirements, including salary. “Mass online job posting platforms, not only on the Balkans, but also in Europe, are often clumsy and inefficient. This is exactly what we want to change with nPloy, having successfully built an innovative job-matching platform based on the dating apps models. We’ve replaced the standard pre-screening process with an AI algorithm allowing users to see only vacancies relevant to their experience and requirements, and employers to source the right candidates more efficiently.” says nPloy Co-Founder Konstantin Tsonev. Currently, nPloy is used by over 85 thousand users and over 500 employers, including BIC, SAP, Lidl, Postbank and others. The platform offers an extremely transparent and efficient selection process. Companies gain access to each candidate’s professional experience and skills, excluding personal data such as names, gender, age and current employer. That guarantees maximum objectivity and fairness of the process to avoid unconscious bias. Employers also have access to the anonymous candidate pool of all users to filter and analyze the market potential of each vacancy they plan to post. “We invested in nPloy because we believe in the urgent need of transforming the recruitment market in Europe. Every good idea needs a great business plan and people who are passionate about its implementation, and nPloy has exactly that,” said Pavel Velkov, managing partner in the VC firm Morningside Hill. nPloy is the only platform where users always know whether their application has been reviewed, approved or not, so the feedback is instant. If mutual interest is shown as in the dating apps, a chat automatically opens between the two parties and a video interview can be scheduled. The latest version of the mobile app also offers the possibility for candidates to follow tailored news, join clubs with like-minded people and various types of career-related online events. “nPloy’s goal is to make things easier. Job finding doesn’t have to be such a complicated and slow process when there are modern technologies to solve these problems. In a market with low unemployment rates and growth in job openings, candidates don’t want to waste time in a couple of interviews just to find out that their financial expectations don’t even meet, for example. Any difficulty, delay and inefficient processes turn down a large number of applicants. This is where nPloy comes in – you create a quick profile and you can immediately apply or wait for an employer to send you a match request for a suitable position,” said Maria Petrova, director of business development in nPloy. The main objective of the team now is to grow to new markets in Central and Eastern Europe. The platform has recently launched on the Romanian market and the feedback is impressive. The founders aim by the end of 2023 the platform will be active in 10 more countries and plan a successful A round of investment for global growth."

The announcement was hailed as a big win for the “Right To Repair” movement, an advocacy group that allows consumers the right to repair their own devices. Almost a year later, Apple announced today it is expandingits Self Service Repair program to some of its laptops includingMacBook Air and MacBook Pro notebooks with M1 chips beginning Tuesday. This means users of these types of MacBooks will be able to repair their own Apple laptops themselves. In a statement Monday, Apple said thatusers with MacBook models that have M1 chips, which include both MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, will be able to order genuine Apple parts, access repair manuals, and rent or purchase the tools needed to fix those devices starting Tuesday, August 23. The Self Service Repair for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro offers more than a dozen different repair types for each model, including the display, top case with battery, and trackpad, with more to come. “Customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices will be able to complete repairs on these Mac notebooks, with access to many of the same parts and tools available to Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers,” Apple said. Apple also added that it will offer rental kits for $49 so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. The Right to Repair movement, which has nowbecome a battle between big tech companies and the people who use their products,is proposed government legislation that would allow consumers the ability to repair and modify their own consumer electronic devices."

The number represents aboutone-fourth of its total workforce.The report added that the Michigan-headquartered auto giant was hoping to reduce $3 billion in operational costs by 2026 to help fund EVs. Fast forward a month later,Ford confirms the layoffs in an internal email to company workers, saying it is cutting about 3,000 jobs mainlyin North America and India, as it restructures to catch up with Tesla Incin the race to develop software-driven electric vehicles. In a joint email,Ford CEO Jim Farley and Ford Chairman Bill Ford wrote: “We are eliminating work, as well as reorganizing and simplifying functions throughout the business. You will hear more specifics from the leaders of your area of the business later this week.” Early this year,Ford CEO Jim Farley announced the company increased its EV spending from $30 billion to $50 billion through 2026. He also stated that the company plans to build two million electric vehicles annually beginning in 2026 as it races to catch up with Tesla. In addition, the company has made a few acquisitions as part of its effort toprovide its EV fleet customers with seamless charging and energy management. In 2021,Ford acquired EV tech startup Electriphi to provide its F-150 Lighting Pro customers with seamless charging solutions. According to Ford, the depot charging industry is estimated to grow to over 600,000 full-size trucks and vans by 2030.The acquisition is also part of Ford’s target to capture over $1 billion of revenue from charging by 2030. In September 2021, Ford also announcedBlue Oval City, an $11.4 billion investment it says will help the company “lead America’s shift to electric vehicles.”The investment includes $4.3 billion in funds from SK Innovation, a Korean company that is also its battery partner.Earlier that year, Ford and SK Innovation also formed a joint venture, BlueOvalSK, to advance Ford’s initiative into all things electric."

Currently, fossil fuels still remain the largest energy source but oil reserves continue to dwindle. What about clean energy? Researchers also predicted that over the next 30 years cannot be met with existing clean technologies (such as solar or wind). Even with the help of new energy storage methods, like hydrogen, the future energy gap cannot be closed reliably. It’s for this reason that nuclear scientists are researchers are in a race to a new type of energy source with zero carbon emissions called nuclear fusion. Unlike the existing nuclear reactor which uses nuclear fission, nuclear fusion harnesses the power of an artificial star on planet Earth to generate electricity and has great advantages over our current sources of energy since nuclear fusion produces no carbon, sulfur, or nitrogen emissions. Nuclear fusion isa nuclear process where energy is produced by smashing together light atoms.Theoretically, nuclear fusion could provide a cheap, clean, and almost boundless source of energy. For example, one tablespoon of liquid hydrogen fuel—a mix of deuterium and tritium—would produce the same energy as 28 tons of coal. That’s why companies like Microsoft and Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, and Microsoft arebetting on a $10 trillion energy solution for the planet with investments in fusion energy startups like General Fusion andCommonwealth Fusion (CFS). But there’s one other startup working on a moredisruptive energy production technology using laser-driven fusion energy. EnterFocused Energy, a fusion energy startupfounded by two physics professors Todd Ditmire and Markus Roth. with expertise in extremely high-powered lasers. Launched last summer,Focused Energy combines direct-drive laser fuel compression with proton fast ignitionto generate a commercially attractive path to harvest energy.  The Focused Energy team consists ofveterans with many years of experience in the nuclear sector, including Prav Patel, who spent 23 years at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In just a few months, the startup has gotten the attention of investors. The startup recently scored $15 million in early-stage funding from the venture capital firm Prime Movers Lab, plus Marc Lore (who sold e-commerce companies Diapers.com and Jet.com to Amazon and Walmart respectively), tech investor Tony Florence, and the former Yankee slugger Alex Rodriguez. “Focused Energy is capitalizing on over 70 years of government research into fusion,” Matthew Moynihan, a nuclear fusion consultant, told CNBC. “They have a credible team and a good plan, but they have hard challenges ahead.” Before founding Focused Energy, Professor Ditmire worked at Livermore for three years, where he worked on the very first ultra-powerful petawatt laser and met Roth. He later joined joined University of Texas in 2020 where he built the Texas Petawatt Laser. “The U.S. electrical grid produces about a half a trillion watts of power. So that’s a half a terawatt,” Dimitre explained in a conversation in June. “A petawatt is 1,000 trillion watts. So a petawatt laser has the same power as 2,000 times the power output of the United States electrical grid.” He explained, “You take all the wattage of the sunlight falling on the state of Texas, it’s about 140 terawatts. So I would always say Petawatt is brighter than the Texas sun.” Todd Ditmire, standing next to the optical amplifiers, a key piece of the Texas Petawatt laser."

The FDIC said that in July, FTX head of U.S. operations Brett Harrison posted a tweet thatcontained misleading claims that funds held at and stocks purchased through FTX were FDIC insured. In a July 20 tweet, which has since been deleted, Harrison stated that direct deposits from employers to the crypto exchange are “stored in individually FDIC-insured bank accounts” and that stocks purchased via FTX US “are held in FDIC-insured” brokerage accounts. In a cease and desist letter sent to FTX USon Thursday, the FDIC said that Harrison’s statements implied that FDIC insurance was available for cryptocurrency and stock holdings and that the agency does not insure brokerage accounts. “FTX US is not FDIC-insured, the FDIC does not insure any brokerage accounts, and FDIC insurance does not cover stocks or cryptocurrency,” the FDIC said in the letter. It continued: “The FDIC only insures deposits held in insured banks and savings associations…and FDIC insurance only protects against losses caused by the failure of insured institutions. Accordingly, these statements are likely to mislead, and potentially harm consumers.” FTX is not alone. The FDIC also warned four other crypto companiesto stop making false and misleading statements about FDIC deposit insurance.In addition, the FDIC also said in its letter thatFTX is also identified as an FDIC-insured crypto exchange on SmartAsset.com and CryptoSec.info The FDIC gives FTX US fifteen business days to comply with the request. FTX was founded in 2019 by 29-year-old MIT graduate Sam Bankman-Fried andhis co-founder Gary Wang. The Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTXoffers derivatives products like futures and options as well as spot trading. Once an unknown startup, FTX has become a key player in the crypto space, rivaling the likes of Coinbase and Binance. Bankman-Fried, who currently resides in Hong Kong, is now worth at least $25 billionmaking him the richest person in crypto, according to Forbes.Sam graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2013 at the age of 21. He was skilled in math and loved to solve problems and give back to society. With $2 billion in total funding since its inception three years ago, FTX has built up a war chest at a time when digital currency prices have sunk considerably. However, Bankman-Fried doesn’t think we’re entering a “long-term crypto winter.”"

The investment, which is a continuation of its 2021 round, was ledby the Lithuanian Business Angels Fund, Czech Presto Ventures, and Lighthouse Ventures. The latest round brings the startup’s total funding raised to €1 million. According to recent data,venture capitalists have decreased their annual investment in early-stage deals by 22%. Venture capital and angel investor funding for various firms have declined since at least 2010.Despite the sector hitting a troubling time, a total of $1.7bn was raised by 34 companies this week. Founded in 2015 byco-founder and CEOGerda Jurkonienė,Vilnius-basedOkredo is an open data platform that provides credit scores, financial ratios, and insights into both freemium and premium accounts, helping companies accelerate growth and mitigate risks. The startup also sets a new standard in the data industry by joining open data, open banking, and credit bureau functionalities. Since its establishment seven years ago, Okredo has become a trusted SaaS platform that enables SMEs to assess the credibility, stability, and sales potential of prospective and ongoing business partners and clients. Okredo’s success in securing funds is an exception in the current state of the startup market. A recent report revealed that the value of venture investments has ticked lower in most months since November 2021, before dropping another USD 5 billion from March to April 2022. The investments into scalable and practical solutions seem to be holding investor interests. Okredo is one of the tech startup companies that has shown steady growth by delivering a solution to a broad issue — access to data. More specifically, an issue that SMEs are now experiencing — most countries’ data is fragmented across several sources, requires numerous integrations, takes a long time to acquire, and is challenging to comprehend. This data could be utilized for both sales and credit risk management. Consequently, there is a need in the market for a product that allows data to be easily understood and aid businesses in resolving these issues — and Okredo plans to offer such practical solutions. In a statement,Jurkonienė said, ”The decision of some venture capital funds to continue investments is a sign of the company’s efficiency and ability to deliver results. The general proliferation of the data market — with its ability to increase the overall speed of business — has also helped attract further investments. The data industry, which has even been dubbed by some as the ‘new oil’, is an attractive field for investors.” She added, “Most importantly, our platform offers a variety of tools that make it simpler to assess businesses’ risks and sales potential. These tools are highly valuable due to the current economic instability, brittle logistical chains, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the reorientation of international commerce. However, European companies currently lack a widely-accessible open data platform to analyze such factors, which is exactly what we want to change. To help tackle this situation, we have also created a number of API solutions for our partners who create ERP, CRM, and accounting systems, adding the value of current data to their services.” The burgeoning of the data industry is a result of the 2019 EU Directive on Open Data and the Re-use of Public Sector Information, which urges EU countries to make publicly financed and public sector data as accessible as possible to enable information re-use, which can result in financial gains. This data market development especially impacts SMEs, which are often exposed to greater risks as they have insufficient knowledge and resources to collect and interpret data and no funds for expensive credit risk management solutions such as credit bureaus or credit insurance. Having successfully launched in the Baltic States, Okredo now plans to take advantage of the EU directive and expand into new markets. The platform was introduced in all three Baltic nations last year and currently has over 17,000 users and more than 3,000 corporate clients. Roman Nováček, partner at Presto Ventures: “Having invested in Okredo a few months ago, we had the opportunity to observe the company’s operations from the inside, to get to know the processes and the team. Our investment has exceeded our expectations and we still see potential in further developing their product and adding new features to broaden the market potential. We want to play a more active role in Okredo’s expansion to other countries. We have no doubt that a single European platform for corporate data can make doing business across Europe more secure, especially for small businesses that were traditionally priced out of the market. They will definitely appreciate it in these uncertain economic conditions” In addition to the planned expansion to the UK and other markets, Okredo is developing an open banking solution for its users. More specifically, the company wants to tackle the critical element in a company’s risk assessment — the financial status based on annual reports that become obsolete even before the official declaration. The solution, with the company’s consent, will categorize cash flow and other financial parameters and enable the sharing of its financial performance with relevant stakeholders throughout the year. Businesses will be able to make financial decisions quicker by engaging business partners, investors, or lending institutions with access to up-to-date data. Even if the financial performance is weakened, the company will be able to address issues sooner, initiate credit amendment actions, etc. In turn, up-to-date data would provide a more thorough basis for business assessment, allowing to improve the structure of internal operations and accelerate business processes."

Their controversial proposal was met with backlashon social media. But their idea is nothing new. A year earlier, a team of researchers andscientists at the Weizmann Institute in Israel had grown synthetic mouse embryos outside the womb solely from stem cells cultured in a petri dish – that is, without the use of sperm or fertilized eggs,but only stem cells taken from the skin. The results of their study findings were publishedin Cell. Prof.Jacob Hannaof Weizmann’s Molecular Genetics Department, who headed the research team explained that the synthetic embryos were not “real” embryos and did not have the potential to develop into live animals, or at least they hadn’t when they had been transplanted into the wombs of female mice. Day 8 in the life of a mouse embryo: a synthetic model (top) and a natural embryo (bottom). The synthetic models displayed a 95 percent similarity in both the shape of internal structures and the gene expression patterns of different cell types After the research,Hanna decided to start his own biotech startup called Renewal Bio withthe missionto reverse “declining birth rates and fast aging populations” by creating “synthetic” human embryos that would be used to harvest organs in order to facilitate transplants and treat conditions such as infertility, genetic disease, and aging. Hanna said the Renewal Bio wants to leverage the success of the earlier research work andreplicate the process with human embryos that would serve as a source of tissues and cells that can be used to treat various diseases. Fast forward about a year later,Renewal Bio announced that it has successfully used advanced stem cell technology and artificial wombs in order to grow mouse embryos which continued to develop for several days. The results of the research werepublished in the journal Cell on Monday. The artificially grown embryos remained alive until they developed beating hearts, blood flow, and the beginnings of a brain, according to MIT Technology Review. The results of the Renewal Bio experiment published in the journal Cell.  Hanna also said that he hopes to eventually produce artificial models of human embryos equivalent to a 40- to 50-day-old pregnancy. “We view the embryo as the best 3D bioprinter,” said Hanna. “It’s the best entity to make organs and proper tissue.” “Remarkably, we show that embryonic stem cells generate whole synthetic embryos, meaning this includes the placenta and yolk sac surrounding the embryo,” Hanna told the British publication.”We are truly excited about this work and its implications.” Hanna also told the Guardian that the synthetic embryos weren’t “real” in that they did not have the potential to develop into real-life animals.“To solve these complex and compounding issues, Renewal Bio aims to make humanity younger and healthier by leveraging the power of the new stem cell technology,” the startup says on its website. Although Renewal Bio’s technical plan has not been disclosed yet, Hanna said the firm’s approach is ethical and provides an alternative to the use of real human embryos. “This is providing an ethical and technical alternative to the use of embryos.” In a statement,Omri Amirav-Drory, a partner at NFX who is acting as CEO of the new company, told MIT Technology Review:“It’s very low on details for a reason. We don’t want to overpromise, and we don’t want to freak people out. The imagery is sensitive here.” Hanna also added: “In Israel and many other countries, such as the US and the UK, it is legal and we have ethical approval to do this with human-induced pluripotent stem cells.” An image showing the embryo growing process in the Cell medical journal.  However, the research is not without controversy. Bernard Siegel, a patient advocate and founder of the World Stem Cell Summit told MIT Technology Review that the experiment has huge societal implications. “This experiment has huge implications One wonders what mammal could be next in line,”Siegel said."

However, integrating these toolsoften requires technical expertise that some may not have without a full-blown IT team. That’s where today’s fintech startup comes in. Enter Deposits,a Dallas-basedPlug-and-play fintech startup that simplifiesthe implementation of digital banking tools for banks, businesses, and brands. Deposits’ cloud-based platform enables credit unions, community banks, insurers, retailers, and even product brands to offer a wide spectrum of payment and banking experiences without the need for deep technical expertise. To further build out its full-stack banking platform, Deposits announced today it has raised $5 million in seed funding led by ATX Venture Partners and joined by Cabal Fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and others.Deposits also plans to use the funding proceeds to expand its sales, marketing, and engineering teams and hire for a range of positions. Co-founder and CEO Joseph Akintolayo started Deposits in 2019 with his friend Daniel Paramo after many years of working with banks and listening to people describe how they want their money to work. “Local banks and credit unions have built trust with customers over decades by keeping money within the community. But those customers often fall out of love because those institutions struggle to provide a modern, mobile-first banking experience,” said Joseph Akintolayo, founder and CEO of Deposits. “Deposits makes it easy for trusted brands to provide stellar experiences with money. This means their customers can participate in a full range of financial services that in turn improve their financial circumstances and well-being.” Deposits opens up access to digital banking by making it easy for organizations, regardless of size, skill or budget, to strengthen their relationships by offering modern financial experiences. These services include mobile apps, fully online account opening, identity verification, debit and credit accounts, mobile deposits, virtual cards, P2P payments, home and auto loans, foreign exchange, and more. Deposits’ modular, flexible platform allows for rapid implementation, enabling partners to offer modern banking services in days versus months. Deposits stands out for its next-generation plug-and-play fintech platform that fills the gap left by embedded finance providers by eliminating technical barriers as well as for its mission to bring modern banking services to new communities. “Local banks and credit unions have built trust with customers over decades by keeping money within the community. But those customers often fall out of love because those institutions struggle to provide a modern, mobile-first banking experience,” said Joseph Akintolayo, founder and CEO of Deposits. “Deposits makes it easy for trusted brands to provide stellar experiences with money. This means their customers can participate in a full range of financial services that in turn improve their financial circumstances and well-being.” The Deposits platform comprises several kits, each of which provides thematic financial experiences for Web, Android and iOS devices using no-code/low-code tools and is extendable through open APIs including Banking, Money, Identity, Commerce, and Workplace kits. “The first wave of embedded fintech platforms demonstrated demand but required deep technical expertise and suffered delayed rollouts,” said Chris Shonk, partner and co-founder at ATX Venture Partners. “Deposits delivers on the promise with a low-code platform that literally any credit union or product brand can use. Combine that with the team Joseph has put together, its compelling mission and impressive early traction, and it was an easy decision to invest.” Deposits partners with a range of networks, aggregators, program managers, and issuing banks to facilitate the issuance of payment cards, loans, and other financial products.

According to apreliminary settlement of the proposed class action filed on Monday in San Francisco federal court, Meta agreed to pay $37.5 million to settle the lawsuit that began about four years ago. However, Meta denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the case. The final settlement requires a judge’s approval before the case is finalized. This settlement covers users in the United States who used Facebook after Jan. 30, 2015, Reuters reported. In a lawsuit that began in November 2018, lawyers for the plaintiffs claimedthat Facebook violated California law and its own privacy policy by gathering data from users who turned off Location Services on their mobile devices. The lawyers are seekingup to 30% of Monday’s settlement for legal fees, the court settlement papers show. “The users said that while they did not want to share their locations with Facebook, the company nevertheless inferred where they were from their IP (internet protocol) addresses, and used that information to send them targeted advertising,” Reuters reported. Meanwhile, this is just one of the many settlement cases Meta has reached in the last few years. In February,Meta agreed to pay $90 million to settle a 10-year privacy lawsuit for tracking users’ activity even after they logged out of its website. As usual, Facebook denied any wrongdoing but agreed to settle the case to avoid the costs and risks of a trial. According to the court filing, users accused Facebook, now a unit of the new Meta Platforms Inc. of violating federal and state privacy and wiretapping laws by using plug-ins to store cookies that tracked when they visited outside websites containing Facebook “like” buttons. The court documents also showed thatFacebook then allegedly compiled users’ browsing histories into profiles that it sold to advertisers.In addition to paying $90 million, Facebook is also required to delete all the data it collected improperly."

Since its popularity a year ago, crypto-enthusiasts, celebrities, and brand marketers jumped on the NFT train hoping to cash in. However, the NFT entered a bear market early this year and sales have been in a freefall ever since.But not for Nike,the world’s largest and most valuable sports footwear brand. Nike, with itsloyal fanbase, first entered the world of NFT and Metaverse late last year with the acquisition of an NFT startup called RTFKT Studios to accelerate its digital transformation.The terms of the deal were not disclosed. RTFKT was founded in 2020 by Benoit Pagotto, Chris Le, and Steven Vasilev. The startup leverages the latest in game engines, NFTs, blockchain authentication, and augmented reality to create one-of-a-kind virtual products and experiences. Then April of this year, the companyintroduced its first collection of virtual sneakers, Cryptokicks collection, which included 20,000 NFTs, one of which was designed by Takashi Murakami. One of the NFT sneakers in the collection was purchased for a staggering $134,000, according to a report by The New York Times. “The mechanics around NFTs and sneakers are pretty similar,” saidJurgen Alker, who runs the NFT studio forHighsnobiety, the lifestyle site that covers streetwear and sneakers. “Both are created around scarcity and drops. It is about community, status, and belonging to something.” Fast forward a few months later.

However, most successful startup founders are motivated by creativity and the drive to solve problems or make lives better by developing products or services that could help improve people’s lives. They are great listeners and pay attentionto the needs and problems around them. That’s the story behindCelonis, a Munich, Germany-based startup that was foundedin 2011 by three college friends, Alexander Rinke, Bastian Nominacher, and Martin Klenk when they were students at the Technical University of Munich.Celonis has been cash flow positive every year since its inception 11 years ago and continues to grow at a triple-digit pace. Celonis helps organizations optimize their business operations, by using what it calls “process mining” software to find flaws, for example, bottlenecks in supply chains, and eliminate them. Just to give you a glimpse of how big the digital transformation market is, enterprises around the world spend more than $1 trillion annually tointegrate digital technology into all areas of business operations and business processes. We first covered Celonis back in November 2019 after raising $290 million in Series C funding to become a member of the highly-coveted unicorn club at a $2.5 billion valuation. Since our last story, the company has quadrupled in value. Today,Celonis announced it has secured an additional $1 billion in funds to accelerate its unique position to help customers thrive in challenging economic environments.The round, which includes a $400 million Series D extension and a historic $600 million credit facility with a syndicate of leading global banks, pushesthe company’s valuation to $13 billion. The latest funding followsCelonis’$1 billion funding round announced in June last year. The $400 million Series D extension is led by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and includes new blue-chip investors Activant Capital, a fund advised by Neuberger Berman, Alta Park Capital and Commonfund Capital. Existing investors including Arena Holdings, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., Franklin Templeton, Durable Capital Partners LP, TCV, 83North, Accel Partners and Sator Grove also joined the round extension. Celonis will use these additional funds to invest in product innovation, drive adoption with Global 2000 customers, expand market potential with acquisition investments, and deepen penetration with ecosystem partners. As Germany’s most valuable private company and New York’s most valuable start-up, Celonis started as a university project just 11 years ago and achieved unicorn status in 2018. Founded in 2011, Celonis is a New York- and Munich-based leader in enterprise performance acceleration software, turning process insights into action with the process mining technology it pioneered. Its Intelligent Business Cloud allows organizations to rapidly understand and improve the operational backbone of their business. Companies around the world including Siemens, GM, 3M, Airbus and Vodafone rely on Celonis technology to guide action and drive change to business processes, resulting in millions of dollars saved and an improved experience for their customers. The Celonis five-year $500 million line of credit is expandable to $600 million and is the largest syndicated bank recurring revenue revolving credit facility of its kind. This debt facility was led by KeyBanc Capital Markets, with Goldman Sachs, HSBC Ventures, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Citibank, and Deutsche Bank acting as joint lead arrangers. Lenders in the syndicate also included RBC Capital Markets, Silicon Valley Bank, SMBC, Citizens, MUFG and Bank of America. “Since the first days of Celonis, we have built a company that is operating on sound fundamentals, immutable customer value, and the kind of resiliency that performs at the highest levels in any economic environment,” said Bastian Nominacher, co-CEO and co-founder of Celonis. “These fundamentals are what puts Celonis in such a unique position to lean into the wind, while others are stepping back. With an additional $1 billion in liquidity, Celonis will have maximum flexibility to aggressively innovate, capitalize on new market opportunities, and extend our market leadership.” “There is a ‘behind-the-scenes secret’ that Celonis is equally effective in driving top and bottom line value in both booming and challenging economies,” said Alex Rinke, co-CEO and co-founder of Celonis. “We have never experienced more urgency from customers to use Celonis to hunt down and fix the kind of process problems that can yield tens to hundreds of millions in cash and time savings.” “Celonis is well aligned with QIA’s strategic focus on innovative, best-in-class companies that are shaping the global economy of the future,” said Mansoor Al-Mahmoud, CEO of QIA. “Celonis is providing clear added value for its customers by enhancing their operational efficiency and driving their performance.

2022.8.23,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/23/sternums-free-license-openwrt-devices-eradicating-issue-trust-iot/,"The number of IoT-connected devices worldwide is expected to approach 30 billion by 2030. This is more than double the 13 billion estimate for 2022. With this many devices, it is worrying that there is still no security standard established for IoT devices until now. Unfortunately, not many pay attention to IoT security. Verizon’s Mobile Security Index 2021 report shows that around 52 percent of organizations sacrifice IoT security to “get the job done.” IoT end users are also unlikely to be bothered by the possible security risks that come with using unsecured devices. This should not be the case, as IoT devices are increasingly playing major roles in cyberattacks. For example, they are used in DDoS attacks, and vulnerabilities in such devices facilitate access to networks or the stealing of login credentials. One company is trying to change the way organizations view IoT security with the announcement of its free license for OpenWrt devices. Sternum, an autonomous security and observability platform, seeks to make device security more accessible and help address the growing threats around IoT devices by making its platform free to use. In late July 2022, Sternum announced the decision to provide its autonomous security and observability platform free for OpenWrt devices. “Using this license, OpenWrt users will be able to activate Sternum security and observability solutions on their own on up to 3 devices,” Sternum CEO and Co-founder Natali Tshuva wrote in a blog post. The free license announcement marks the first time for a security solution to be made free for IoT devices. Tshuva explained that the decision to make their platform freely available was aimed at setting a standard of openness and trust-led growth in the IoT security industry. Tshuva added that there are plans to expand the free license to other Linux and RTOS variants such as Zephyr, VxWorks, and FreeRTOS. So how does Sternum’s decision to make its security platform free for OpenWrt devices solve the IoT security trust issue? As Tshuva mentioned, Sternum seeks to promote openness and trust-driven growth in IoT security. It is difficult to establish openness when the opportunity to test security products is paywalled. Tshuva explains that one of the reasons why organizations do not accord IoT security the attention and priority it deserves is the lack of trust. Security solutions may be available, but not many are convinced or compelled to give them a try because of distrust. “The (IoT security) space is quickly becoming saturated with players that make impressive marketing claims but fail to deliver during the evaluation phases,” she writes. It is frustrating to invest time and effort in getting familiarized with a security solution only to be disappointed with the results. To emphasize, IoT security is just a fraction of the overall cybersecurity of an organization. Adopting an IoT solution entails the need to integrate it with the rest of the security controls and security posture management system. In the modern cybersecurity paradigm, security controls cannot be left to operate independently lest they result in silos that end up becoming vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can serve as ways for threat actors to defeat or get around cyber defenses. Sternum’s free license for OpenWrt devices is a way to “flip the script and win back user trust – to create easier ways to experience IoT security solutions.” Tshuva says that this has already been done in other industries, so doing the same with IoT makes sense. “Here too, putting the product into the hands of the users, and allowing them to reach their own conclusions, can be a powerful way to win back user trust, boost adoption and help disregard all of those past disappointments,” Tshuva notes. Sternum offers autonomous security and observability platform to help device makers ensure that their products have real-time protection and autonomous threat monitoring. This embedded self-protection platform designed for low-resource devices provides active threat mitigation for any kind of device with its patented exploitation fingerprint technology. Sternum offers device manufacturers an out-of-the-box product security solution that prevents vulnerability exploitation in real-time. It is capable of protecting virtually all product components (software side) including third-party libraries. This allows manufacturers to optimize product delivery in the aspect of cybersecurity, making it unnecessary to undertake repetitive debugging and endless patching. Providing a centralized security data platform, Sternum establishes reliable security visibility that delivers accurate and consistent real-time data from various devices. This keeps security teams constantly informed about emerging threats and new vulnerabilities. Moreover, it is designed to work across different environments or operating systems with its generic direct-to-binary approach and self-monitoring function. Sternum has an impressive list of features, which include the following: These may sound too promising—even incredible to some. However, with the Sternum autonomous security and observability platform made free for the wide range of OpenWrt devices, organizations get the opportunity to prove if the features and outcomes advertised are real or attainable. IoT security cannot continue to be placed on the back burners. It is time to have IoT security standards. While standards are yet to be discussed and agreed upon, it is important to use available security tools that can enable security for IoT devices. For IoT manufacturers, trying out Sternum as a free security solution on their devices is a great start."

In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),Elon Musk said he’s seeking to end the $44 billion deal, citing a lack of sufficient information on fake accounts and spam bots. It turns out there’s more to the story and Musk might be right. In an explosive whistleblower complaint published by The Washington Post, former Twitter security chief Peiter ‘Mudge’ Zatko alleges thatTwitter buried ‘egregious deficiencies’ andmisled regulators about lax security and bot and spam accounts. Zatko claimed that the social media company misled federal regulators about the spam and bot accounts,according to complaints filed with the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Justice, The Post reported. The complaints were filed by nonprofit law firm Whistleblower Aid, which is representing Twitter’s former head of security Peiter “Mudge” Zatko.In the complaint with the SEC, Zatko alleged that he “witnessed senior executive engaging in deceitful and/or misleading communications affecting Board members, users and shareholders” on multiple occasions in 2021, during which CEO Parag Agrawal asked Zatko to provide false and misleading documents. CNN also reported thatTwitter executives don’t have the resources to fully understand the true number of bots on the platform, and were not motivated to,citing Zatko’s complaints.A lawyer representing Zatko said the former Twitter employee has had no contact with Elon Musk, who in July said he was withdrawing his $44 billion bid to acquire the company. “We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding,” Musk attorney Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel told media outlets. Zatko alleges that a tweet by CEO Agrawal on May 16, which said the company is “strongly incentivized to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can, every single day” was “a lie.” He said Twitter executives are not incentivized to detect bots and “senior management had no appetite to properly measure the prevalence of bot accounts” because “if accurate measurements ever became public, it would harm the image and valuation of the company.” Zatko further alleged that Twitter didn’t have proper security controls in place. According to The Washington Post, about 7,000 Twitter employees had “wide access to the company’s internal software, and that access was not closely monitored.” In a statement, Twitter said Zatko was fired in January “for ineffective leadership and poor performance.” “What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context,” a Twitter spokesperson told CNBC. “Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be.” Meanwhile, an analysis conducted by Israeli cybersecurity company CHEQ back in May found that12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.“Up to 12% of all traffic originating from Twitter is made up of bots.”CHEQ found that11.71% of all website visits originating from Twitter were by bots or fake users. In a May 17 tweet,Musk said that “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.” 20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.

Today, we now have new updates based on the Whistleblowerdisclosure filed in July with federal regulators (pdf)th regulators in July.In the filing, Zatkosaid that Twitter misled Tesla CEO Elon Musk about the number of bots on the platform. His disclosure also includes the allegation that the true number of spam accounts and bots on Twitter is probably “meaningfully higher” than the 5 percent of daily monetizable users that the social media firm claims. “26.A more meaningful and honest answer to Mr. Musk’s question would be trivial forTwitter to calculate, given that Twitter is already doing a decent job excluding spambots and other worthless accounts from its calculation of mDAU. But this number islikely to be meaningfully higher than 5%.“ Zatko didn’t stop there. He alsomade a series of explosive allegations regarding Twitter’s cybersecurity policiesincluding the claim that Twitter was “lying about bots to Elon Musk.”  Zatko accuses Twitter of fudging numbers and furtheralleges that Twitter uses an “opaque metric” called monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rather than an earlier metric of total monthly users that was subject to big swings, including when spam and bot accounts were removed. “Until 2019, Twitter reported total monthly users, but stopped because the number was subject to negative swings for a variety of reasons, including situations such as the removal of large numbers of inappropriate accounts and botnets. Instead, Twitter announced a new, proprietary, opaque metric they called “mDAU” or “Monetizable Daily Active Users,” defined as valid user accounts that might click through ads and actually buy a product. From Twitter’s perspective “mDAU” was an improvement because it could internally define the mDAU formula, and thereby report numbers that would reassure shareholders and advertisers. Executives’ bonuses (which can exceed $10 million) are tied to growing mDAU,” the disclosure states. Zatko also added thatexecutive bonuses—which could be in excess of $10 million—are tied to mDAU growth. He allegesthat Twitter executives are “incentivized to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU” in order for the platform to be more appealing to advertisers. Zatko also claims in the disclosure that there are “many millions” of active accounts that aren’t part of the mDAU calculations because they’re spam bots or Twitter doesn’t think they can monetize them, but their presence on the platform still affects user experience. Zatko also asked the company’s Head of Site Integrity—who’s responsible for addressing platform manipulation, including bots—what the underlying spam bot count was, according to the disclosure. “We don’t really know,” was the response, according to the disclosure, which said that “the company could not even provide an accurate upper bound on the total number of spam bots on the platform.” Now dozens of banks, funds, and other stakeholders have been subpoenaed to testify at a non-jury trial scheduled for October. Zatko could end up its star witness. In his response to the bombshell disclosure, Musk tweeted: “So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public …” So spam prevalence *was* shared with the board, but the board chose not disclose that to the public … pic.twitter.com/lXk48TFZL1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 23, 2022  Meanwhile, Twitter insists that spam bots on its platform represent less than 5% of users.

2022.8.24,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/hackers-stole-100-million-worth-nfts-past-year-report/,"In just two years, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have grown from under $100 million in 2020 tosurpass $40 billion in 2021. TheNFTmarket cap is now forecast to reach over $80 billion by 2025. However, as NFT popularity soars, so is the number of hacking incidents.The number of NFT thefts skyrockets in the last few months ashackers shifted their tactics and began to set their sights on NFTs. According to a new report from blockchain research firm Elliptic, cyber thieves have stolen over $100 million worth of NFTs since July of 2021. Even with the decline in NFT sales, theLondon-based Elliptic said in its report that scams remain rife in the NFT market. The firm also added that “security compromises via social media have surged, accounting for 23% of NFT thefts in 2022,” Reuters reported. Elliptic said that cyber thieves received an average of $300,000 per scam, adding that the true scale of NFT thefts could be higher because not all NFT thefts are publicly reported. “There is a growing threat to NFT-based services from sanctioned entities and state-sponsored exploits,” Elliptic said, citing a $540 million theft in April which U.S. officials have linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The firm explains that nearly$8 million of the theft are involved inmoney-laundering on NFT-based platforms, with another $329 million worth of funds in the NFT market coming from services such as the so-called crypto tumbler or cryptocurrency mixers, which are designed to hide the funds’ origin. In February,about $2 million worth of NFTs were stolen from the world’s first and the largest NFT marketplace OpenSea in a phishing hack. The company’s CEO Devin Finzer also confirmed that the platform was hit by a phishing attack and at least 32 users had lost their valuable NFTs worth $1.7 million. Then two months later, in April, hackers again stole $13.7 million from the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT project. The group said that hackers stole 54 NFTs estimated to be worth $13.7 million after BAYC’s Instagram account and Discord server were breached. NFTs are digital tokens that can’t be exchanged for one another. They’re often touted as a way to prove ownership of digital assets like art or sports collectibles.Since its popularity a year ago, crypto-enthusiasts, celebrities, and brand marketers jumped on the NFT train hoping to cash in.However, the NFT entered a bear market early this year and sales have been in a freefall ever since. NFT sales have dropped by 95% in monthly trading volume, fromnearly $17 billion in total trading volume across all platforms in January 2022 versussales of $800 million in August this year."
2022.8.24,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/everdreamsoft-brings-spells-genesis-social-hub-sandbox-part-metaverse-push/,"The metaverse has become the latest buzzword since Facebook announced its name change to Meta back in October. The popularity of the metaverse has also taken online gaming with the launch of new metaverse games. One of these games isThe Spells of Genesis, thefirst blockchain-based mobile game where users can collect, trade, and combine orbs to build the strongest decks. Now, Spells of Genesis (SoG) takes the next step in its Metaverse push in The Sandbox. Through its Spells of Genesis – Askian Door social hub, players can come face-to-face with their favorite in-game characters. Metaverse experiences will help unlock a new wave of interactivity between visitors and otherwise static characters, game worlds, etc. Spells of Genesis – Askian Door is one exciting example of what that future may entail, as the social hub will be accessible through The SandBox. In the “Askian Door” social hub, people will be at the entrance to Askian, where everyone can gather. Some of the most iconic in-game characters are brought to life and can be interacted with. In addition, users can collect hidden Satoshi Blocks spread across the SoG metaverse and explore spots of interest, all of which have strong ties to the game. You can find the social hub’s trailer here while waiting for the official release date on September 30th. In addition to enabling a more interactive user experience, the iconic Spells of Genesis NFT collection will return to The Sandbox Marketplace and 10 brand new NFTs will be added to the collection. That is a significant development, as users who participate(d) in the previous and/or new drop by buying an NFT will have a chance to win a The SandBox Season 3 Alpha Pass. These passes are a feature designed by The Sandbox and unlock rewards up to 500 $SAND for the holders who accomplish quests within the Alpha Season 3. EverdreamSoft, creators of the SoG universe, will give away three such passes via their official Twitter account. More information on these giveaways will be announced via the EverdreamSoft and Spells of Genesis accounts in the coming weeks. Furthermore, The Spells of Genesis team is also excited to announce that every individual who owns an NFT from the SoG collection on The Sandbox Marketplace will gain exclusive access to all future Spells of Genesis experiences within The Sandbox. The team continues to bring long-term utility to the non-fungible tokens being created to ensure optimal interactive benefits to community members. The Sandbox Alpha Season 3 is an event that runs for 10 weeks and spans over 90 different experiences. There are a total of 10,000 Alpha Passes available, with up to 500 $SAND and other guaranteed rewards for Season 3 Alpha pass holders. The Sandbox continues to push the boundaries of what metaverses are capable of and how they can bring together communities across different projects to help unlock new social interactions. EverdreamSoft maintains an Estate of 6×6 land plots in The Sandbox. Its Spells of Genesis – Askian Door social hub resides on one of the land plot, with more experiences to occur across the Estate in the coming months and years. In addition, Sandbox community members had the opportunity to buy digital real estate land around the EverdreamSoft Estate in February. By owning land, participants received 3 premium NFTs including the Spells of Genesis’ iconic Bearwhale. The EverdreamSoft team also dropped SoG NFTs in April 2022 through a collaboration with talented artists from Nabiya studio. A series of 14 voxelized NFTs were available to eligible community members. EverdreamSoft (EDS) is a Swiss-based company founded in 2010 as a game studio. Since 2014 EDS has been pioneering the integration and use of blockchain tools in the domain of gaming and digital collectibles. With their mobile game Spells of Genesis, pre-launched in 2015, EverdreamSoft set a trend of “true ownership” of digital assets. EDS is also the creator of EverdreamSoft Crystal Suite, an integrated suite of tools allowing to explore, create, share and manage “Orbs” – rare digital items (art, game items, collectibles) linked to blockchain tokens. EverdreamSoft is also one of the founding members of the Blockchain Game Alliance (BGA). The Sandbox is a play-to-earn game that combines blockchain technology, DeFi, and NFTs in a 3D metaverse. Its virtual world allows players to create and customize their games and digital assets with free design tools. The virtual goods created can then be monetized as NFTs and sold for SAND tokens on The Sandbox Marketplace."

Although the technology is still in its infant stage,NFTs can be used to represent ownership of any digital assets. Because each NFT is unique and cannot be replaced by another token,NFT can be used in different industries including arts, decentralized marketplaces, and supply chain management. NFT can also be used in agriculture, water management, and environmental causes. An example of this is how two startups are working together to use NFT to help save up to 40% in water for irrigation. Kilimo is a big data startup that provides solutions for water management in agriculture. The startup features climate monitoring by using satellite and site data to provide prescriptions for each crop and increase water use efficiency. Kilimo and WakeUp Labs recently joined forces to tokenize water savings through NFTs to achieve water-neutral goals and reward farmers. Today,WakeUp Labs, which is built on Rootstock, announced it has partnered with Kilimo, one of the leading digital platforms for irrigation management in agriculture, to provide the technology infrastructure for generating water-saving certificates using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This means that farmers’ water savings will be represented by an NFT, which can be bought by companies that want to compensate for their water footprint. This mechanism will generate additional income for farmers who use irrigation efficiently. WakeUp Labs, part of Rootstock Ecosystem, will support the creation of NFTs certificates that will be registered on the blockchain, thus providing clear evidence of the water savings achieved. Rootstock, the first Bitcoin sidechain that brings smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin network, has more than 50% of the Bitcoin hash rate, which makes this entire ecosystem one of the most secure in the world. Kilimo is a ClimTech start-up that verifies and helps to improve water consumption in agriculture. They use Big Data and Machine Learning to effectively use these resources in agriculture. Their irrigation practices are used by over 2,000 farmers. By 2050, 51 percent of the population could be at high water risk according to a report made by the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) in 2020. And here Kilimo saved over 72 billion liters of water in Latin America. Kilimo Founder, Jairo Trad, said: “We are excited because Kilimo’s technology will allow farmers to receive income for saving water, and simultaneously companies can offset their water footprint. This is how we can make Everyday DeFi a reality” “Amazing to see RSK being tapped by these two influential players for a great sustainable cause that’s helping enable innovative everyday DeFi for farmers,” commented Augustin Pandolfini."

According to an internal memo seen by CNBC,Packable sent a notice to employees Monday that it was laying off 138 people, or roughly 20% of its staff, with the remaining 372 employees expected to be terminated as “individual winddown responsibilities are completed.” The memo was signed by Leanna Bautista, the company’s chief people officer. Packable also stated it was forced to take the measure due to its inability to securenew financing that would have enabled it to stay in business. The companypreviously secured funding from high-profile investors, including Carlyle Group, Fidelity, and Lugard Road Capital. Packable had planned to go public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) about a year ago. But that hope was dashed after the SPAC market evaporated due to the sputtering economy. Just about a year ago,Pharmapacks was the No. 1 Amazon seller in the U.S. It now ranks fifth among the site’s top sellers nationwide, according to research firm Marketplace Pulse. “We diligently pursued internal and external financing options but were ultimately unsuccessful,” the company said. “Given the company has no viable financing alternatives, we are now forced to cease operations, liquidate any remaining collateral, and shut down the business, including the facility you report to.” Founded in 2010 as a single brick-and-mortar pharmacy in the Bronx, New York,Pharmapacks is an online seller of health, personal care, and beauty products. The pharmacy marketplace startup later moved online and built its business on Amazon.In addition, Pharmapacks also sells products on marketplaces run by Walmart, eBay, and Target. The quick reversal was shocking.Just two years ago, Amazon was by far Packable’s largest channel, accounting for 80% of all the company sales, according to an investor presentation."
2022.8.24,techstartups.com,https://techstartups.com/2022/08/24/chingari-adds-new-monetization-option-video-nft-marketplace-creator-cuts/,"Blockchain-friendly social media app Chingari said this week it has launched Creator Cuts, a brand new video NFT marketplace that will showcase the most popular videos from its top creators. Through Creator Cuts, fans will be able to buy a tokenized version of these videos and earn a share of the passive income they generate. The popular Chingari app has become a huge hit in India, its home nation. It was launched back in 2018 as a kind of alternative to TikTok, which was later banned in the country. Like TikTok, Chingari users can create short videos with background music and various kinds of overlaid graphics and filters and share them with their fans. Chingari is today one of India’s most popular social media apps, ranked among the biggest downloads in the Google Play store. It’s available in more than 20 languages, including English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and others. Since last year, Chingari has been a vocal advocate for cryptocurrency and believes it can drive an entirely new and fairer “creator economy” that will see its most popular influencers earn rewards for creating and sharing content. Moreover, their fans will benefit too, earning rewards for engaging with their content. To enable this creator economy, Chingari created its very own cryptocurrency, called GARI, which now serves as the key element of its recently launched GARI mining program. Through it, Chingari app users can create a GARI wallet and earn crypto daily simply by logging into the app, watching videos, liking and sharing their favorites. Meanwhile, the creators themselves earn GARI rewards based on how many likes, views and shares their videos receive. Given the status of Chingari as one of India’s most popular social media networks, it’s no surprise that GARI is now ranked as the number two project on the Solana blockchain in terms of active wallets. To date, there are more than 1.1 million active wallets, just six months after GARI was first launched. Creator Cuts is designed to build on this nascent crypto-creator economy in several ways. For creators, it enables them to monetize their most popular videos by minting them as NFTs and selling them. Buyers of the NFTs will then be entitled to 10% of the daily GARI rewards those videos earn, meaning that if they’re smart and they buy a video NFT that has the potential to go viral, it could be a very smart investment. The exact rewards each video NFT earns will be based on how many daily likes, views and shares it receives. Moreover, Creator Cuts provides a new way for creators and their fans to engage with one another. Chingari’s CEO Sumit Ghosh said the main vision for Creator Cuts is to empower creators in new ways. “We believe in the immense potential of the Creator Economy and are wholly committed to its growth and democratization across the spectrum,” Ghosh said. To that end, Chingari is always looking to innovate with unique programs and ideas that intersect with popular culture, and its ecosystem growth, Ghosh explained. “The introduction of Creator Cuts is one such unique initiative which empowers the creators as well as the community to not only form deeper connections but also grow together in the truest sense of the term,” he added. It’s certainly a novel idea. By allowing creators to sell what is essentially a share of their passive income, they’ll be able to form much deeper relationships with their biggest fans. At the same time, video NFT holders will be motivated to share and promote their tokenized content, benefiting both themselves and the content creator. Creator Cuts is available in beta now, with an exclusive collection of 100 hand picked videos currently available to buy. Later, Chingari said it plans to expand Creator Cuts, enabling anyone to mint their content as NFTs and sell them to their fans."
2022.8.22,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/22/twelve-makes-jet-fuel-from-co2-signs-deal-with-microsoft-alaska-air.html,"Sustainable aviation fuel, commonly called SAF, has so far been expensive to produce, but new startups are now creating clean fuels out of carbon at a much cheaper cost. Now, new tax credits for clean fuel production from the recently signed Inflation Reduction Act could propel these companies further faster. Most SAF is made out of carbon from organic vegetable oils, but Twelve, a chemical technology company based in Berkeley, California, is making fuel out of carbon dioxide. It just announced a collaboration with Alaska Airlines and Microsoft to advance production and use of Twelve's E-Jet, a lower-carbon jet fuel. ""Our process takes CO2, water and electricity as inputs. We use the electricity to break apart CO2 and water, and then we have catalysts that recombine the elements to make new products. And one of the things that we can make is the building blocks for jet fuel,"" said co-founder and CEO Nicholas Flanders. What the climate bill does for the nuclear industry More than 100 million Americans will be exposed to extreme heat by 2053 Parts of Great Barrier Reef show highest coral cover seen in 36 years The process, according to Flanders, is far cheaper than existing SAF production. ""The cost of renewable electricity has been falling over the last decade, so has the cost of CO2 capture, and so has the cost of electrolyzers, which is the technology that we use to transform CO2 and water into the building blocks for jet fuel,"" he said. Flanders says aircraft would not need to be changed in any way to accommodate the new fuel, which he said has 90% lower emissions than conventional jet fuel. That's huge for airlines trying to reach aggressive emissions goals. ""We have a goal of reaching net zero by 2040. We've got five steps to get there,"" said Diana Birkett, senior vice president of public affairs and sustainability at Alaska Airlines. ""But sustainable aviation fuel offers the biggest opportunity of all of those steps to take a meaningful leap into that 2040 goal."" At scale, the technology should be cost-competitive with traditional jet fuel, Flanders says. Twelve is backed by DCVC, Capricorn Investment Group, Carbon Direct, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, Breakout Ventures, Munich Re Ventures and Elementum Ventures. It has raised $200 million to date."
2022.8.18,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/18/focused-energy-fusion-industry-veterans-bet-on-insanely-strong-lasers.html,"As the effects of climate change become more obvious, the promise of nuclear fusion — a virtually unlimited source of carbon-free energy — is getting a new wave of attention. The field has drawn almost $5 billion in funding, with recent interest off the charts. One of the newest efforts to commercialize fusion comes from startupFocused Energy, founded by a pair of physics professors with expertise in extremely high-powered lasers,Todd Ditmireand Markus Roth. The startup launched last summer and has a strong bench of veterans, includingPrav Patel, who spent 23 years at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Now the startup has scored $15 million in early-stage funding from the venture capital firm Prime Movers Lab, plus Marc Lore (who sold e-commerce companies Diapers.com and Jet.com to Amazon and Walmart respectively), tech investor Tony Florence, and the former Yankee slugger Alex Rodriguez. Unlike nuclear fission, which powers all the commercial nuclear reactors in the world today, fusion does not generate long-lasting nuclear waste. But it requires a sustained reaction at extremely high temperatures, and despite decades of effort, nobody has yet figured out how to turn it into a commercially viable energy source. There are two religions in the race to commercialize fusion: magnetic confinement fusion, which uses ultra strong magnets and a round device called a tokamak, and inertial confinement energy, which typically uses lasers. Prime Movers Lab has invested in Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a Boston-based fusion company spun out of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as its best bet for magnetic confinement fusion. Focused Energy is its top pick for the ""breakout"" laser driven approach, according to partner Carly Anderson. Even so, attempting to contain the same energy source that powers the sun will require a lot of research and effort. ""Focused Energy is capitalizing on over 70 years of government research into fusion,"" Matthew Moynihan, a nuclear fusion consultant, told CNBC. ""They have a credible team and a good plan, but they have hard challenges ahead."" Ditmire worked at Livermore for three years, where he worked on the very first ultra-powerful petawatt laser and met Roth. In 2000, Ditmire joined University of Texas in where he built the Texas Petawatt Laser. Its power is hard to conceptualize. ""The U.S. electrical grid produces about a half a trillion watts of power. So that's a half a terawatt,"" Dimitre explained in a conversation in June. ""A petawatt is 1,000 trillion watts. So a petawatt laser has the same power as 2,000 times the power output of the United States electrical grid."" He continued, ""You take all the wattage of the sunlight falling on the state of Texas, it's about 140 terawatts. So I would always say Petawatt is brighter than the Texas sun."" In 2010, Ditmire started a company in Austin called National Energetics to design and build the kind of high-powered lasers he needed for his own research. ""It turns out it in 2010, the only place you could get a customized power laser was from France,"" Ditmire told CNBC. At the company's peak, it had a staff of about 30. In 2014, National Energetics won a $40 million contract to deliver a 10 petawatt laser system to the Czech Republic, which the company is in the final stages of finishing. After that project is wrapped, so too will the company. Ditmire is transferring all the intellectual property from National Energetics into Focused Energy. ""I decided it was time to go off and slay a bigger dragon,"" Ditmire said. ""And what what bigger dragon could there be than fusion energy?"" For a six month period, Ditmire worked with Marvel Fusion, another startup working to commercialize fusion with lasers. Roth also worked at Marvel Fusion for a time. Marvel Fusion is using proton boron as the fuel source, which is an ""interesting concept,"" according to Ditmire, but his ""real interest"" was in working with laser fusion and using fuel made from hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium. So Roth and Ditmire decided to start their own company. In 2009, the Lawrence Livermore finished building the National Ignition Facility, where 192 laser beams point to a central chamber, creating the kinds of temperatures and pressures that exist in the center of stars, planets, and an exploding nuclear weapon. Patel expected the team to get to a key fusion landmark, called ignition, within a few years. ""I thought it would be quick. And that was almost that was 10 years ago. Then we spent the next 10 years getting the ignition,"" Patel told CNBC. The lab finally reached ignition on Aug. 8, 2021, meaning it had produced 1.3 megajoules of energy. Omar A. Hurricane, the chief scientist for the Inertial Confinement Fusion Program at the lab told CNBC at the time it was ""a Wright Brothers moment"" for the fusion industry. That validation was an important step for investors in the nascent industry. ""The NIF shot removed a major element of risk for Focused Energy's approach,"" Anderson told CNBC. ""For Focused Energy to achieve cost-effective fusion, the team needs to develop cheap lasers and cheap fusion fuel. These are engineering challenges. Significant scientific risk (solving the plasma physics challenges needed for a machine that will produce burning plasma from scratch) has been retired."" After that milestone achievement, Patel was willing entertain Roth and Ditmire's offer to join them — an offer he'd previously declined. Focused Energy is going to use both the kind of lasers that Ditmire has been building and the kind that Patel has worked with for decades at Lawrence Livermore. ""We have conventional long pulse lasers like at NIF to compress this fuel. And then we have these Petawatt lasers that Todd was talking about to produce this intense beam of protons,"" Patel said. The goal then is to ignite the fuel with a spark. Ideally, that fuel continues to burn on its own — what's called a ""propagating burn"" — to fuse the rest of the fuel, Patel said. ""It's a scheme that potentially with lasers two or three times smaller than NIF, you could potentially get 30 times more energy out."" One of the advantages of using laser-ignition fusion, as opposed to magnetic confinement fusion, according to Ditmire, is that it uses only tiny pellets of tritium, a mildly radioactive isotope. The company is in very early stages and faces significant challenges ahead. ""They need to be able to cheaply and reliably make small pellets of fusion fuel and place them inside a chamber for compression.Once fused, they have to covert the resulting fusion energy into safe, economic and reliable electricity,"" Moynihan told CNBC. ""All of this needs to be done within the legal frameworks for fusion written by the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) and those rules are still evolving."" Focused Energy aims to prove out its fusion process with an ignition facility by 2030. That will cost $3 billion to build. The $15 million raised so far will be spent on a laser system at University of Texas at Austin and to build out experimental facilities in Darmstadt, Germany. Demo power plants in the 2030s is ""not inconceivable,"" Ditmire said. ""And that's not too late. It's probably just in time. We probably don't have time to dally, but it's just in time."" A commercial fusion facility will cost Focused Energy about $5 billion to build. But the money is flowing in fusion right now. It took Ditmire four years of going back and forth to Washington D.C., lobbying on the Hill, to get $15 million to build the Texas Petawatt laser. ""It took me four years of work. You know, we went out and raised $15 million with 4 Zoom calls,"" for Focused Energy, Ditmire said. ""The investor interest was just stunning."" The fusion industry depends on investors' continued interest in the ""holy grail"" of energy. ""We stand on the shoulders of giants,"" Ditmire said. ""But times are changing, which means the rate at which science progress has happened is going to have to accelerate, and the place that's going to happen is in is in the private sector."" For Ditmire, it's personal, too. ""It is my raison d'être in my career to make this happen before the end of my career,"" he told CNBC. ""This is it, baby. This is the dragon in Mordor."""
2022.8.16,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/curio-led-by-energy-dept-veteran-aims-to-recycle-nuclear-waste.html,"Ed McGinnis knows a lot about the nuclear waste problem in the United States. He worked in U.S. Department of Energy from 1991 to 2021 and dealt directly with the U.S. government's failed effort to build a nuclear waste repository in Yucca Mountain, Nevada. ""I certainly have the tire tracks on my back"" from trying to lead the United States to develop and execute a long-term storage plan for nuclear waste, McGinnis told CNBC in a phone conversation in June. ""Essentially, both parties have said it's politically unworkable"" to find a permanent solution, McGinnis told CNBC. ""But during the meantime, we have a huge, huge unresolved problem representing pretty much the largest ball and chain on the ankle of the U.S. nuclear energy sector that's trying to transition itself for the next generation of reactors."" McGinnis no longer works for the government, but he is still working to solve the nuclear waste problem at the helm of a startup called Curio, founded in 2020 by brothers Yechezkel and Yehudah Moskowitz as part of their investment holding company, Synergos Holdings. The brothers founded Curio to develop next-generation advanced nuclear reactors. After some research, they decided there were already many companies innovating in that space, but far less competition to deal with the nuclear waste problem. The United States generates about 2,000 metric tons of new nuclear waste per year, adding to the approximately 86,000 tons that are already generated. Reprocessing nuclear waste is one way to make it less radioactive, but there's only enough capacity in the world to reprocess 2,400 tons per year, and most of that is in France (1,700 metric tons) and Russia (400 metric tons). The pre-revenue, ten-person startup is still in the very early stages of a capital-intensive, long-term build out. But it aims to have a pilot facility up and running in six years and a commercial nuclear waste reprocessing facility up and running by 2035, McGinnis told CNBC. Curio's commercial plant will have a capacity of 4,000 metric tons when fully built out. It will cost $5 billion to build and it will be about the size of an NFL football stadium. ""We would take title of all 86,000 metric tons and the federal government and the public would never see that high level radioactive material on their books again, we would take the burden of it,"" McGinnis said. ""And we would take trash and turn it into products and treasures. That's our business line."" Calling the fuel that comes out of conventional reactors waste is a misnomer, according to McGinnis, because only 4% of the potential energy value has been used. But it's dangerous, with enough radiation to harm humans for approximately a million years. Curio has developed a chemical process it calls NuCycle to turn nuclear waste into usable products, like fuel for advanced nuclear reactors, as well as isotopes that can be used for other functions, such as generating ingredients to make power sources for space missions, and power sources for tiny batteries. The process reduces the amount of radioactive waste to less than 4% of what it started with. That waste would require only about 300 years of storage, McGinnis told CNBC. ""There is essentially a treasure trove of products and commodities that are waiting to be extracted from this so called waste,"" McGinnis told CNBC. Right now, Curio is ""refining and validating the chemistry,"" McGinnis said. Some of that work involves collaborating with scientists at the national labs around the country, but those partnerships are in very early stages. Critically, Curio's technology will be different from an existing process called PUREX(plutonium uranium reduction extraction), ""which among other things separates and extracts plutonium in a pure stream,"" which can be a problem under nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaties. ""We have a process where we never separate out pure plutonium,"" McGinnis said. ""We're never going to do that because we want to have a proliferation security-hardened process. We have self-protection built in."" One of the most challenging aspects of dealing with nuclear waste is convincing local community members to accept a facility in their backyard. ""Public communication is very, very important,"" McGinnis said. Curio said it is engaged with multiple states about locating its facility there but declined to name them. But he believes the economics would be helpful for many local communities. ""A facility like ours would employ well over 3,000 full time, well paid jobs,"" McGinnis said. McGinnis also says negotiations for a recycling facility are going to be easier than those that are for a permanent repository. ""I led efforts meeting with states trying to convince them of why they should accept material that's going to be there for 10,000 years. That's a very, very difficult thing,"" McGinnis said. ""And I can understand why the NIMBY communities see that as a big issue. But again, this is apples and oranges."" (NIMBY is an anacronym for ""not in my back yard."") The U.S. needs to explore new and innovative technologies solve its nuclear waste problem, Steve Nesbit, the former president of the American Nuclear Society, told CNBC. ""When advanced reactors get going, it makes more sense (to me) to develop and deploy recycling for those materials,"" he told CNBC. It's possible to recycle waste and put some elements of that recycled waste back into the existing fleet of nuclear reactors, but ""it is better suited for some advanced reactor designs,"" he told CNBC. He said he ""certainly"" knows McGinnis, but added ""Curio is keeping its cards pretty close to the vest, for now."" Curio's goals are formidable, said Ashutosh Goel, a Rutgers professor who has done research on dealing with nuclear waste with a process called ""immobilization."" ""Yes, what Curio is targeting is ambitious. However, isn't that the case with anything in nuclear energy?"" Goel told CNBC. ""If we are serious about reducing the carbon footprint and still meeting the energy demands of the nation, we cannot accomplish this goal without nuclear energy."" Goel does not know Curio or McGinnis personally but is aware of them professionally. ""Ed is a well-known leader in the field of nuclear energy, thanks to his leadership roles in the US Department of Energy. Therefore, I am hoping for positive things from Curio,"" Goel said. Curio is making smart steps early on, according to Ben Cipiti, a nuclear engineer at Sandia National Labs, that is working on a proposal for an government grant with Curio. ""I see Curio as having a good shot at making progress in this area since their approach utilizes lessons learned from the past,"" Cipiti told CNBC. ""They're partnering with national laboratories to take advantage of the latest research and development and the wide variety of expertise required to be successful in this area."" If Curio is successful, the work could be transformational for the industry as a whole. ""Once we solve this, in my humble opinion, I think it it Tesla-fies the nuclear industry in a way we've never seen, because it's such a heavy ball and chain on on the nuclear sector — it affects public opinion, acceptance, economics, investors,"" McGinnis said. ""So when we finally show a no nonsense, thoughtful solution to the back end, that's when the nuclear energy sector takes off in my view."""
2022.8.16,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/16/climate-bill-could-create-1000-new-companies-breakthrough-investor.html,"The Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress includes a $369 billion investment in climate and energy policies, the biggest investment in U.S. history to fight climate change. From tax breaks to direct subsidies, it has big implications for businesses in clean energy, clean manufacturing and clean innovation. Its passage will be huge for startups in the climate space as well as the big venture capital firms that back them.  ""Everybody wants to be part of this,"" said Carmichael Roberts, co-leader of the investment committee at Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the climate fund founded by Bill Gates. ""The calls that I'm getting now — tremendous, already, and there was already a big groundswell around climate, but this just really boosted even further."" Roberts said the ability to manufacture in the United States, thanks to tax breaks and other incentives, is ""transformative"" for startups and will incite entrepreneurship. ""I bet you there's somewhere between 300 to 1,000 companies that will exist now because of this bill that would not have existed,"" said Roberts. Startups in the climate space already are applauding the passage. Here's what the CEOs of some companies featured in CNBC's Clean Start series have to say: Perhaps the biggest impact is that government investment in climate initiatives and innovation will give private investors much more confidence in the climate space. ""The venture capital dollars will flow in a lot faster from areas that may not have been investing in an area, but now all of a sudden, see, wow, we're going to have a real path to scale with the best and the brightest people, and the best companies being created.

2022.8.10,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/10/ukrainian-ceo-shares-lessons-on-how-to-run-a-business-during-war.html,"Like all CEOs, Aleksandr Volodarsky bears the heavy responsibility of the success or failure of his company. But the 36-year-old has to make hard decisions that most CEOs don't have to — he is running a start-up in war-torn Ukraine. ""The biggest problem is not to have people in place. One of the [employees] who's fighting on the front line is our chief marketing officer,"" said the founder of Lemon.io, an online freelance marketplace for software developers. When Russia's invaded Ukraine in February, Volodarsky told his 60-strong staff that their jobs will be retained and they will continue to receive salaries — even if they are mobilized or fight voluntarily. ""A lot of people were misplaced and lost their jobs … this helped a lot because if you have to go through this experience and also worry about your income, it's like double anxiety,"" Volodarsky said. ""If you lost your job, it's much harder to go through this."" What are the lessons this CEO learned from running a start-up during wartime? CNBC Make It finds out. As the war drags on, Volodarsky is now faced with uncertainties for the future. ""One of the hardest questions right now is, how do we hire another person — or not hire another person — and keep the [first] person?"" He added: ""I want to take this job [chief marketing officer] but actually suck at the job … it's not efficient, it's not good for the company in the long run. But we need someone to do the job."" That's not the only dilemma he has ""no good answers"" for. For example, should he hire men right now, given that there could be ""full mobilization"" at any time? ""On one hand, excluding someone is just an ugly thing to do. But on the other hand, I have 60 people that I'm responsible for, and if I do something that can hurt the company and their future income, I cannot do that,"" Volodarsky said. He added that he is still ""debating"" on the right thing to do, but one thing for sure — he wants to keep his promise to all of his staff. ""Decisions I make right now are not the decisions to make [the situation] better. It's just … to suck less."" Volodarsky also decided to pay his employees in advance — and in cash. ""Closer to the war, people got more nervous and we said, let's try to make some plans so people feel confident,"" he said. ""We decided to give people two months' salary in advance so they have cash. Whatever happens, people always need cash … the banking system can go down, whatever can happen."" True enough, the Ukrainian central bank suspended electronic cash transfers on the same day that Russia invaded the country. As the invasion proceeded, ATMs across the country started to run out of cash, and some people stood in line for hours only to face a $33 limit per transaction. ""It's been challenging. The last five months have been a bit messy … but people are confident that if we are working, they have [a sense of] security."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent 3 million people fleeing their homes and into neighboring countries in less than three weeks. Because of that, a lot of people couldn't work, said Volodarsky. ""They had to relocate, make their own plans and help their families. At the beginning, we said, 'Screw all the goals [for the company], we just want to make sure that people can get settled.'"" But Volodarsky realized that didn't help with his employee's morale. ""When everything is a mess and uncertain … having a sense of accomplishment actually helps [them] to live a normal life. At least you can see that there is some progress in what you do, instead of sitting and waiting for the war to be over."" He added that he started steering his team to push for the goal that was set before the war, which was for the platform to be ""the main source of income"" of software engineers. ""We also have smaller goals to improve the platform and user experience … People [in the company] are excited because they actually can provide jobs [for] a lot of Ukrainian developers,"" said Volodarsky. The start-up says it will provide jobs to 1,000 engineers by the end of 2022. ""You feel there's a little more meaning in what you do. I saw people get very excited every little win that we had."" Volodarsky's decision to give ""all profits"" to the Ukrainian military has also given his company a good dose of motivation. ""Not everyone can do something [for the war], but they know that if they can keep contributing to the company and the company is growing … they actually have influence."" However, Volodarsky stressed that giving up profits is less ""heroic"" than it sounds. ""Actually what are profits? You make revenue and whatever you need to spend on — salaries, advertisements … and then whatever's left you give to the army,"" he said. ""Giving people money is not hard. We are able to do this because we've been able to generate some cash and we're still profitable."" Volodarsky added that the company has always been ""capital efficient,"" while taking ""very little outside funding."" ""It cannot hurt you because you give only the profits … we're very happy that we've given a lot of money and it is very fulfilling to help the army get closer to victory.""

2022.8.8,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/fernish-startup-aims-to-put-an-end-to-fast-furniture.html,"In this article The furniture industry generates about 10 million tons of waste that ends up in U.S. landfills each year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. While it doesn't get the type of attention that fast fashion does, fast furniture is just as harmful to the environment. California-based startup Fernish is trying to mitigate that by marketing furniture rentals to a higher-end, professional consumer. Fernish allows its customers to either rent to own, or return the pieces when they're done with them. While furniture rental isn't new, it's often used by consumers who can't afford to buy. With younger generations more mobile than ever, Fernish's co-founder, Michael Barlow, said the problem was right in front of him. ""After walking by many, many, I'd say, nuclear bombs or furniture on the side of streets in urban metros where I lived or some of our other employees lived, we came up with the idea of reuse, refurbish and recycle,"" said Barlow. Barlow said 90% of his customers hadn't heard of furniture rental before finding Fernish. The company's pieces are of higher quality than typical rental companies and therefore easier to refurbish and re-use. Veronica Droulia and her roommates were recently moving out of small apartments and into a larger townhome in Washington, D.C. They didn't have enough furniture, so they went looking online. ""I really, really, valued the sustainability that Fernish has, and I also just wanted something that felt like a forever piece. As a 25-year-old, I don't know where I'm gonna be next. I don't know where I'm going to move to,"" she said. Droulia is a social media influencer, so she made a deal with Fernish to promote the 18 pieces she chose, rather than pay rent on them. If she paid, the bill would be about $900 a month. Fernish's backers include Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff, former Amazon worldwide consumer CEO Jeff Wilkie, Intuit co-founder Scott Cook, and Khosla Ventures, TechStarts and RET Ventures. Total funding so far: $75 million."

But bringing them on board wasn't too difficult, he said. ""They saw how this business was growing in front of them, they saw how quickly we achieved what we achieved."" It took just nine months for Vohra and his co-founder, Aadit Palicha, to bring Zepto — an app from India that promises to deliver groceries in less than 10 minutes — to a valuation of $900 million. How did two teenagers build one of India's fastest-growing quick commerce apps? CNBC Make It finds out. Finding a good product-market fit is important, said Vohra. His advice on how to do that? ""Speak to customers. Just use that as a holy grail [to] ensure you're on the right track to finding product market fit."" ""One of the hardest things is actually getting to that point where you have a product that people love … It is much easier and much faster if you're constantly speaking to customers, getting feedback from them and learning from them,"" he added. In the early days of Zepto, the 19-year-olds handled customer support themselves and delivered groceries to consumers just so that they could have a quick chat with them. ""We still do it till this day … We've got millions of customers, with hundreds of thousands of orders every day. [We still] spend a significant amount of time just speaking to customers, learning from them,"" said Palicha. ""Going in with the mindset that you're wrong and learning where to get right … that journey has been humbling."" Palicha and Vohra weren't always taken seriously — not just because of their age, but also because of the ""craziness"" of an under-10 minutes delivery idea. ""When we started this 12 months ago, every conversation we had was, 'You're totally out of your mind, this is never going to work,'"" said Palicha. But their conviction in their product kept them going. ""Kaivalya and I fell in love with the product so much that we just saw ourselves as custodians of what would probably end up being a large phenomenon in consumer internet in India,"" said Palicha. ""If we don't build it, somebody else will. When you operate with that mentality, everything becomes less intimidating."" That's why the duo could take on ""challenging conversations"" with investors, senior executives, and even a government official, Palicha added. Despite being just one of many businesses to join the instant commerce wave, it has caught the attention of investors. Its latest cash injection of $200 million in May brought Zepto one step closer to unicorn status. ""Falling in love with the product and building that conviction really just pushes you to … see that product through,"" said Palicha. Palicha and Vohra have been friends since they were seven-year-olds — a major advantage as they turned from childhood pals to business partners. ""Kaivalya and I really complement each other's skill set. He has always been more technically sound than I am, so he's made a great chief technology officer,"" said Palicha. ""12 months ago, when we were building the first iteration of the product, I don't think we'd been able to get it off the ground [without him]."" For Vohra, it's their ability to ""hold each other accountable"" that brought them this far. ""This has been something we've been doing since way back … [even as] weworked on a bunch of projects together throughout school,"" he added. ""Over time, I think that relationship just strengthened.

2022.8.2,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/02/stanford-dropouts-startup-worth-millions-could-be-india-tech-unicorn-.html,"""When we started this 12 months ago, every conversation we had was, 'You're totally out of your mind, this is never going to work,'"" said teenage CEO Aadit Palicha. Yet, Palicha's company has managed to prove those doubters wrong — it's now nearing unicorn status and is one of India's fastest-growing quick commerce apps.A unicorn is a startup valued at more than $1 billion. Zepto is a startup that promises to deliver groceries in less than 10 minutes. Despite being just one of many businesses to join the instant commerce wave, it has already caught the eyes of investors. Its latest cash injection of $200 million in May 2022 valued the business at $900 million, just nine months after its launch. Driving its meteoric growth are Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two 19-year-olds who dropped out of Stanford University to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams. ""At that point, we had already scaled to a couple million dollars of annualized revenue. We said here's an opportunity to raise a large amount of capital, it's got clear product market fit,"" Palicha told CNBC Make It. ""How many people in their lifetimes get an opportunity to build a potential generational company? We figured that was just a more exciting opportunity than studying in an elite university."" The idea for Zepto came in July 2021 — when the childhood friends were stuck in their homes in Mumbai, right in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic and a nationwide lockdown. At the time, demand for delivery services surged as many stayed home. ""Online groceries [would] take six, seven days to deliver, offline options were practically shut down or unavailable. It was incredibly difficult for us to get groceries,"" said Palicha, who is Zepto's CEO. ""We had sort of similar conversations with our neighbors that complained about pretty much the same problem. That's when we said … why don't we try building a solution for the folks in our neighborhood?"" But Palicha and Vohra were no strangers to the instant grocery delivery business. In 2020 — at just 17 years old — they started KiranaKart, which they said delivered groceries in Mumbai in under 45 minutes. ""Some people were getting their deliveries [within] a 10-15 minute timeframe,"" Vohra said. ""In terms of their retention, how much they liked the platform and how frequently they were referring to their friends, [it] was significantly higher for those people who got the deliveries in that timeframe."" ""Which is why we said, 'Look, maybe there's some value in exploring that.'"" They weren't wrong. According to research from consulting firm Redseer, India's online grocery market could be worth up to $25 billion by 2025 and that is an opportunity that was ""too compelling to pass up,"" said Palicha. ""If you look at all the other major categories of e-commerce — electronics, apparel, you take all of them and combine them, they're a fraction of the grocery market,"" he added. In order to fulfill grocery orders in under 10 minutes, the duo established a network of dark stores, or microdistribution hubs across cities. Dark stores are are closed to the public, housing goods meant solely for online ordering. ""We design our network across the city, to make sure that our points of pickup are very close to population clusters in a specific neighborhood,"" Palicha said. ""What ends up happening is that the average distances of our deliveries are so short, we're able to get deliveries done consistently in 10 minutes."" The startup added that the average distance for its deliveries ranges from 1.7 to 2 kilometers. Other forms of hyperlocal delivery, it said, could be ""2 to 2.5 times longer than that."" Today, Zepto says, it operates hundreds of dark stores across 10 cities in India, with tens of thousands of delivery drivers at work. Palicha added that it is currently delivering ""90 to 95%"" of its orders between five and 20 minutes. But speed is not Zepto's only secret to retaining customers and building loyalty. The startup, whose name comes from zeptosecond — the smallest unit of time — claimed it is adding 100,000 new users daily. ""To really retain customers for the long term, what do you really need to build is trust and reliability. Reliability comes in many ways,"" said Vohra, who is also the chief technology officer. ""Yes, we deliver on time, but also reliability in terms of — if I ordered 10 things, I get those 10 exact things. And if I order fruits and vegetables, [they're] the highest quality possible."" Investors are excited about Zepto's popularity too. To date, the company had attracted $360 million dollars from investors, including Y Combinator, U.S. health-care consortium Kaiser Permanente and Nexus Venture Partners. Its latest funding round puts the company on course for a likely $1 billion valuation. Palicha said one the key drivers of Zepto's investment success is its ""operating discipline."" ""When we went to investors this time around, we showed very, very clear paths to profitability. We went from $0 in revenue roughly a year ago to today, we're doing hundreds of millions of dollars in annualized revenue,"" he added. ""We're still talking in terms of multiples and not percentages when it comes to our growth rate, and that's something that we're excited by."" Zepto claims it has managed to reduce its cash burn rate by 5 times on a per-order basis, while achieving a quarter-on-quarter revenue growth of 800%. Even so, the days of easy money for cash-burning tech companies are gone, as interest rates rise and investors demand more results. Nonetheless, the young founders remain unfazed. ""We're in a position where you look at the size of our balance sheet, we effectively got capital to last us multiple years, in the context of this downturn,"" said Palicha. ""Since day one, we've been … forcing ourselves to be efficient to make every dollar last.We're able to do more orders with the same amount of cash, we're able to acquire more customers with the same amount of cash."" Keeping costs lower than its competitors in the high-growth tech category has given them an edge, said the duo. ""That just puts us in a position where we are able to continue growing sustainably, where other folks have been forced to … induce layoffs, essentially pull back growth plans and contract to survive in a market like this,"" Palicha added. Because of that difficult environment, Palicha and Vohra aren't resting on their laurels despite the fresh funding that Zepto has in the bag. ""The key focus now is to just build the incremental scale we need to break even in key markets. Once we have a balance sheet that is now operating in breakeven, we can start expanding into new cities with a lot more confidence and clarity,"" said Palicha. It was previously reported that Zepto is making $200 million to $400 million dollars in annualized revenue and the founders are now hoping to ""touch the billion mark."" Palicha added: ""[Zepto] came out as a personal project between Kaivalya and [me] to see if we could solve a problem at a small scale in our neighborhood."" ""It eventually evolved into the company that we are today, which we're incredibly grateful for.""

Its units can be used as mobile communications and command centers, medical units, kitchens and even temporary housing. The systems can be ready for use within 15 minutes of arrival. Most mobile units like these have been powered by diesel fuel, which emits carbon dioxide when burned, contributing to climate change. But Sesame's units have solar panels on top which unfold, giving the company its name -- a reference to ""open sesame.""

Others include Morgan Stanley, Pax Angels, and Belle Capital.The company has raised only $2 million so far, which may seem like very little for a company with such broad potential. But Flanagan said revenues tripled in the last year and are set to do that again this year. ""The reason we haven't raised a lot of capital is because we have revenues. I'm a kind of old-school operator, I believe in get product market fit, find customers who will pay, iterate and improve it and try to run as close to break-even as you can, and then you've got options, right?"" she said. One of those is a potential new business model where rather than selling the units the company would rent them out. She wants to get FEMA on board with something like that, which she said would be a gamechanger. Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC."
2022.7.21,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/21/fifth-wall-closes-500-million-climate-fund-to-decarbonize-real-estate.html,"Fifth Wall, a venture capital firm focused on real estate technology, is tripling down on its bet that climate tech will become an integral driver in the real estate space. It just announced commitments of half a billion dollars to close its inaugural Climate Fund, which launched with $116 million in August of last year. It is the largest private fund formed specifically to decarbonize the real estate industry, according to the firm. Nearly 40% of global carbon dioxide emissions come from real estate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative. About 70% are produced by building operations, and the rest come from the construction process. Given that most real estate already exists, the goal of net zero emissions is difficult to attain. The fund aims to invest in software, hardware, renewable energy, energy storage, smart buildings and carbon sequestration technologies. ""What we're looking to do is identify the major spend categories where real estate owners are going to have to deploy capital. And then our business is buying noncontrolling minority positions in those companies,"" said Brendan Wallace, co-founder and managing partner of Fifth Wall. He emphasized the fund then works with those companies to accelerate their growth. ""We have some of the largest owners and operators and developers of real estate as LP's (limited partners) in our fund, so by virtue of those relationships, we can help grow these early stage tech companies, open these distribution lanes for them, where we basically have their largest customers as our LP,"" he added. Those partners are some of the biggest names in real estate, from single-family rental developers and operators to the hospitality industry. They include American Homes 4 Rent, which builds and manages rental homes and communities in 37 U.S. housing markets. ""The investment for us is relatively small, but the access to a number of small prop-tech, as well as environmental companies all looking to improve single-family rentals is really what excites us about the opportunities. We have a lot of rooftops and a lot of consumption of energy,"" said David Singelyn, CEO of American Homes 4 Rent. ""From a marketing standpoint our residents are typically those, that millennial generation that really values this."" For real estate companies, the investment return is pretty straightforward: they're improving their own businesses. ""But financial investors and institutional investors also get that this is one of the biggest opportunities,"" said Wallace. ""It's a generational investment opportunity, because, unlike 20 years ago, this is now imminent, real estate firms have to decarbonize."" ""It's about to become a retrofitting industry,"" said Wallace, who admits that his half-billion-dollar fund is just a drop in the bucket against what he says will be an $18 trillion expenditure to decarbonize commercial buildings alone, never mind homes and infrastructure. What he calls ""shocking"" is that so little venture capital is being deployed in climate tech today. ""Historically, only about 6% of all venture capital dollars into climate tech has gone into tech to decarbonize real estate. So it's kind of systemically underfunded in traditional venture capital markets,"" he said. Other limited partners include BBVA, British Land, Camden Property Trust, CBRE, Cosan, The Durst Organization, Equity Residential, Hilton, Host Hotels & Resorts, Hudson Pacific Properties, Invitation Homes, Ivanhoe Cambridge, Kimco Realty Corp., Lineage Ventures, MGM Resorts, NZ Super Fund, Osgoode Properties and UDR. The fund has already invested in several technology companies, including Assembly OSM, Brimstone, Clarity AI, Electric Hydrogen, Icon, Sealed, Span, Turntide Technologies and Wildcat Discovery Technologies, according to Fifth Wall."
2022.7.21,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/21/heres-how-you-can-recession-proof-your-career-according-to-one-ceo-.html,"Fears of a global recession are growing, and a number of tech companies have announced massive layoffs and hiring freezes to curtail spending. From Apple and Meta, to Microsoft and Netflix — the tech sector, which boomed during the pandemic, is showing signs of a downturn. ""This news is discouraging enough to cause anxiety, forcing professionals to go above and beyond to keep their jobs,"" said Aleksandr Volodarsky, CEO of Lemon.io, an online freelance marketplace for software developers. How can you recession-proof your career? CNBC Make It finds out more. Don't rely on just one way of making money — that's the ""best anti-crisis strategy,"" according to Volodarsky. ""Ideally, look for gigs in different verticals, geographies, and skill sets to diversify your income portfolio and minimize risk. If one of your gigs shuts down, you'll have a much easier time finding a replacement for, say — 30% of your income rather than losing everything all at once."" However, there are other options on top of freelancing or working several jobs at once. ""You can always find a company that offers you multiple projects rather than just one, thus minimizing risk while still staying in a more comfortable work environment,"" Volodarsky added. The freelance workforce continues to grow as more and more people want flexibility and freedom when it comes to work. In the U.S. alone, there are more than 6 million independent professionals as of 2021, according to freelancer platform Fiverr's 2022 Freelance Economic Impact Report. ""This workforce is estimated to have earned $247 billion in revenue in 2021, up from an estimated $234 billion in 2020,"" said the report. Volodarsky said that the increased demand for agile workers is the ""perfect opportunity to escape corporate slavery"" and increase earnings potential — without quitting or changing your job. ""If you do leave the corporate world, don't worry about having to spend an incredible amount of time building professional reputations before getting your first cent."" With a cloudy outlook for the rest of the year, venture capitalists are warning their portfolio companies to prepare for tougher times. And some start-ups have taken action. For instance, Swedish fintech giant Klarna, which became Europe's most valuable fintech unicorn in June last year when it was valued at $46 billion, announced last week that it's planning to lay off about 10% of its global workforce. ""They are VC-backed companies that burned through cash … fast-tracked hiring, and counted on VCs to keep pouring in cash. Now that the situation has changed, they're forced to cut back,"" said Volodarsky. ""Always triple-check the companies you work with, as you can often see the signs of trouble in massive spending, and consider bootstrapped businesses that are conscious about their funds and transparent about their profits,"" he cautioned. Even in the most challenging times, there are skills that are in high demand, said Volodarsky. ""Every crisis is an opportunity."" Volodarsky's advice is to research on skills that are trending, talk to human resources or team leaders to ""find out how to become a valuable asset."" ""Employers appreciate and promote talented staff members who are eager to learn,"" he added.

2022.7.12,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/12/gopuff-cuts-10percent-of-its-global-workforce-closes-76-us-warehouses.html,"Delivery startup Gopuff is cutting 10% of its global workforce and closing 76 U.S. warehouses, according to a letter to investors. The layoffs impact about 1,500 employees who will be notified throughout Tuesday, the letter said. The company is also closing 76 warehouses, about 12% of its network, across the U.S. while expanding services at other higher-performing sites. ""As part of our efforts to remove overhead and drive operational efficiencies, we have made the incredibly challenging decision of reducing our global workforce by 10%,"" the letter said. ""While difficult, this restructures us to align more closely around business priorities while accelerating our path to profitability."" The current cuts are an effort to help the company be profitable by 2024, it said in a letter to investors. Gopuff also said it will focus on improving its core business, which is instant delivery, and increasing international investment, especially in the U.K. ""These shifts are not only accelerating our timeline to profitability, they are taking us back to our roots of keeping profitability at the core of every decision,"" the letter said. ""We remain committed in our ambition to building a generational business and feel confident as ever in Gopuff's performance and ability to capitalize on the moment before us."" Gopuff last year was valued at $15 billion. The company had reportedly been eyeing a 2022 public listing, but has since put those plans on hold amid a broader slowdown in market debuts. The news was first reported by Bloomberg. Gopuff is one of the so-called fast delivery companies, which often promise orders to reach your door in 30 minutes or less. Firms like it been heavily subsidized by venture capitalists. But a dramatic shift has seemed to occur in recent months in the rapid delivery segment as VCs move away from a growth-at-all-costs model that once boosted companies like Uber."
2022.7.10,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/10/a-new-way-iconic-brands-like-pg-nokia-cash-in-on-rd-moonshots.html,"In this article For over a decade, the research arm of Nokia Bell Labs in Finland had been working on a cooling and energy efficiency technology for data centers and mobile network equipment. In June, that R&D effort took a big step outside its corporate parent. Innventure, which finances, operates and manages companies spun out from multinational corporations, formed Orlando-based Accelsius to house the Nokia innovation as a stand-alone startup. This approach to giving corporate R&D a life of its own is becoming more common. Co-founded by former Walgreens CEO Greg Wasson and his family office Wasson Enterprise, Innventure accesses the innovations inside corporate R&D labs with the goal of building businesses externally at less startup risk than the venture capital route and ultimately having that former parent company as a key customer. Since its formation in 2015, the industrial innovation investment firm has reviewed more than 100 technologies with multinational companies, vetting disruptive technologies that can solve critical needs and have the potential to create $1 billion or more in new enterprise value within five years. It finances the new firms through its Innventus Fund with additional strategic investment and debt. For at least a decade, many big companies have created their own corporate venture capital arms to invest in promising startups that may be disruptive threats to their businesses as well as potential acquisition targets. The Innventure model of innovation is another approach that is working far outside Silicon Valley venture circles, with corporations leveraging their internal R&D by bringing it together with external startups to be commercialized, and then become a client of an innovative business from the collaborative effort.  It's not multinationals alone that are pursuing this approach. ""We're starting to see some of these deals where a private equity firm comes in and helps a corporate carve out a startup. This could develop into a trend,"" said John Garvey, global head of financial services at PwC in New York. He added that so far it is largely being done by smaller, specialized private equity firms looking for quality assets in a frothy environment where there is immense competition for deals. ""If the firm is willing to put in the sweat equity to build the company, it is a way of working with a fixer-upper, and not at a premium price,"" he said. Several large companies, such as BMW, Siemens, and Bosch, have adopted another method to make key startup connections, known as ""venture clienting."" ""Corporations can be a great resource for technology, and through outside partnerships and startups can make use of it without owning a stake in it,"" said Gregor Gimmy, founder and CEO of Munich-based consultancy 27pilots and developer of the BMW Startup Garage,  the venture client unit within the automaker.""The beauty of this is that the corporation makes more money from using the technology rather than owning a majority stake in the startup, and without the enormous cost and risk associated with corporate venture capital investing."" Using this venture client model, BMW integrated machine learning camera technology into its vehicles as early as 2007 from Intel's Mobileye (which had been a stand-alone Israeli company before being acquired by the chipmaker and is intended to become a stand-alone company again through an IPO planned for this year) and started installing smart sensor software that detects roads conditions from Haifa-based Tactile Mobility beginning 2021.  ""This is a way to leverage startups without the enormous cost and risk associated with corporate venture capital investing,"" said Gimmy, who estimated that only one out of 10 corporate venture capital investments done in a conventional way with equity actually results in a strategic benefit. The Nokia-born Accelsius was Innventure's third collaborative company, but the firm's initial partner is giant packaged goods company Procter & Gamble. Well-known for brands like Tide and Ivory, the Cincinnati-rooted company – formed in 1837 as a soap manufacturer – has been venturing outside these core businesses in recent years. P&G is taking patented inventions from its research and development labs, which have a $1.9 billion R&D budget, and teaming up with startup incubators and investors to create entirely new businesses and categories.  The goal is not just about a financial return on investment, but maintaining access to technology innovation, said Valarie Sheppard, former P&G treasurer and company transition leader who had responsibility for the global business development for several years before retiring in March 2021. Startups, meanwhile, can leverage large, resource-rich, well-capitalized corporations to gain market access, customers, facilities, and industry expertise. The departure from the conventional model of corporate innovation was championed by Tom Cripe, a retired P&G executive who was a gatekeeper of its leading edge research and today heads up business development at Innventure. Cripe says he realized it made sense to reverse a long-held R&D process at P&G. Instead of startups and outside investors pitching P&G on scaling up new tech, the company would create the inventions, then turn them over to investment experts to nurture. Two startups to recently emerge with P&G innovations as a catalyst are located in its home state of Ohio and focused on environmental sustainability and plastics recycling – PureCycle Technologies and AeroFlexx. Located in the former iron-producing town of Ironton in southern Ohio, an area that needs economic revival, PureCycle launched in 2015 using P&G's proprietary process to transform the most commonly used and least recycled plastic wastes into a renewable, purified resource. ""P&G deserves a lot of credit for having an R&D budget to develop something completely new that even big players in plastics didn't come up with,"" said Mike Otworth, PureCycle's chairman and CEO, who also is a co-founder and board chairman at Innventure. ""For a company whose core business doesn't involve plastics, this is truly remarkable.This new recycling innovation could help fix our broken trash system,"" Otworth said. PureCycle's first product with P&G made from its recycled plastic is a shower dispenser that P&G's EC30 cleaning products line introduced late last year. It was made from trash in bins collected from U.S. stadiums. PureCycle has begun working with U.S. sports stadiums to recycle and repurpose their trash. This July, PureCycle plans to recycle tossed-out souvenir cups from the home stadium of the Jacksonville Jaguars team, which follows a deal with the Cleveland Browns last November. Long-lasting, rigid polypropylene such as waste carpet is the most common type of plastic worldwide, but less than 1% of it gets recycled. By contrast, about 30% of other more common plastics like those used for bottles and consumer goods is reused. PureCycle Technologies is aiming to eventually recycle 10% to 20% of the tougher plastics. At an industrial site along the Ohio River where a Dow Chemical plant once operated, PureCycle plans to begin churning out recycled plastics at full scale by the end of 2022. But that's about two years behind the original timetable after delays in raising financing and further tests of the technology at a pilot manufacturing plant. PureCycle broke ground for a second plant in Augusta, Georgia, in March 2022. ""They have the innovation and now they need to scale up,"" said Steve Alexander, president and CEO of the Association of Plastic Recyclers in Washington, D.C. By 2030, PureCycle aims to have 80 recycling operations worldwide, Otworth said, including one in Japan where it has an agreement with Mitsui & Co. to develop a plant. PureCycle has been gearing up for $800 million in annual revenue by 2024 and $2.3 billion in 2027. Just within P&G, there is more than one model for bringing innovations to market. The consumer giant has a new business division focused on creating brands and technologies outside its existing product categories, either through organic development or through acquisitions and joint ventures.  Guy Persaud, a 21-year veteran of P&G who has done the corporate tour of duty in Greater China, Europe and Latin America, was named president of the unit in early 2021, reporting to COO Shailesh Jejurikar. His role encompasses P&G's ventures studio, helping startups incubate their ideas and obtain resources to scale startups. Over the past seven years, the studio has rolled out three new brands in health and beauty categories as well as Zevo, a line of household insecticides. Persaud, who now works from the twin towers of P&G's downtown Cincinnati headquarters, also has taken up a post as board chair at Cintrifuse, a P&G and Kroger-supported accelerator and investor in a budding startup hub of the city known as Over-the-Rhine for its once-large German immigrant population. At a recent annual meeting of Cintrifuse, Persaud said he sees strong opportunities for fintech, sustainability and women and minority-led enterprise startups to thrive in the region, working with big companies such as P&G. ""P&G's collaboration with Cintrifuse opens up innovations with startups, and Guy is put in that role to make P&G more nimble,"" said Peter Blackshaw, CEO of Cintrifuse. P&G is the biggest investor in Cintrifuse's syndicate venture fund of $110 million. One thing the new model hasn't changed is the high degree of risk associated with moonshot ideas that come out of the lab but have a long way to go before achieving economies of scale and offering the market a cost-effective solution. In March 2021, PureCycle completed a $1.2 billion SPAC on Nasdaq, a move that prompted short selling firm Hindenburg Research to issue a report noting that PureCycle is the ""latest zero-revenue, ESG-themed SPAC taken public with a bold story about how it will someday revolutionize the plastics recycling industry."" The stock has suffered steep losses since the offering, down more than 70% since its first day of trading, and it has faced multiple class-action lawsuits, as well as an SEC investigation into statements made in securities filings. The SEC closed that review without any further action taken and the company says it remains focused on its business goals. P&G's second spin-out business with Innventure is West Chester, Ohio-based AeroFlexx, which launched in 2018 with technology for a liquids package that is flexible and uses far less plastics and is fully recyclable. P&G stands to be a major customer of both Innventure startups, given its goal of 100% recyclable or renewable plastics by 2030. Beauty products company L'Oreal and French energy company Total also have been lined up as initial purchasers of PureCycle's plastics. AeroFlexx has completed select pilots and soft launches with P&G brands Dawn, Olay and Old Spice, as well as a handful of non-P&G brands such as Mighty Mutt dry shampoo for dogs and hair clipper maker Wahl. ""Once we license the technology from P&G, our job is to fund it from inception to exit off the balance sheet with investment partners and debt financing,"" said AeroFlexx CEO Andy Meyer, also an Innventure co-founder."
2022.7.7,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/07/how-this-former-lehman-brothers-banker-built-a-pandemic-proof-business.html,"Declan Ee always knew he wanted to run his own business. But when he graduated from University College London in 2006, he saw his peers applying for jobs at investment banks and decided to give it a try. His first gig? Lehman Brothers. ""I liked seeing how businesses worked on a global scale. So that was very interesting."" But the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers not only roiled global markets, it was a shake-up for Ee too. ""I was in the subprime mortgage division. I dodged reporters while walking to Lehman in Canary Wharf. It made me double down on leaving banking at some point."" The 39-year-old Singaporean did leave investment banking eventually in 2016, to build his furniture start-up, Castlery. Today, the business is bringing in millions and its modern pieces can be found in over 300,000 homes globally, said Castlery.CNBC Make It finds out how. It all started when Ee came back to Singapore 11 years ago and was furnishing his marital home. His good friend and co-founder Fred Ji was also looking for affordable modern furnishing. ""We shared a bond in that … [the process was] frustrating. We want to get the nice pieces but they are so inaccessible."" That is due to things like the price point and managing multiple lead-times of furniture, he explained. That's when they had the idea of selling affordable, designer furniture to ""urban millennials"" between 25 to 45 years old. ""This age group, you go through a lot of change. You leave school, you start building your career, you get married, you have a kid … We add stuff to our homes,"" the president of Castlery told CNBC Make It. Ee wanted to provide options to young adults who want to have an ""inspiring space"" and ""something more than Ikea,"" — without breaking the bank. In 2013, Ee and Ji went digital-first with Castlery, allowing consumers to view a virtual studio and purchase furniture online — a disruptor in the traditional furniture industry. ""When customers started to shop online for furniture, they realized that, 'I don't need to go to 25 furniture stores anymore.' The next time they need to buy something, they will do it online again."" Ee's experience in investment banking, where he ""saw many blow-ups,"" has taught him a thing or two about running his own business. When it came to financing Castlery, Ee was determined to not go down the ""venture capital route"" too early for his start-up. ""With the VC game, you want to mock up your valuation every 18 months. And when we started, I knew that we had to spend time learning the business,"" he said. Having no experience in the furniture retail business, Ee estimated he needed six to seven years to master the ropes, which is as long as the ""fund life"" of VCs. ""Straightaway, there's a conflict … that's why stress happens — you don't have clarity of thought, because you have to scale at all cost."" Instead, Castlery's initial investments came from family members and other entrepreneurs who have exited their businesses. ""At the core, it's about building a good foundation and a strong business that gives value to your target customers. That will always translate no matter what, whether you want to sell or list your company,"" Ee said. When the pandemic hit in 2020, Castlery had just begun expansion into the U.S. market, apart from its presence in Singapore and Australia. ""I thought, wow, this is really not meant to be. I was really stressed because our most profitable country was Singapore and there was the circuit breaker too."" He was referring to partial lockdowns in 2020, designed to break the chain of infection. But his stress turned to surprise as he saw a surge in e-commerce, with nationwide lockdowns pushing shoppers to rely on internet retailers for their consumer needs. And as millions of employees were shut out of their offices and required to work from home, the ""meaning of home"" also changed, Ee observed. ""It's not just a place you come back to [after work]. You are doing your work, you're pursuing your passions, you have your kids. How you furnish your home matters because you're spending much more time there."" With more people looking to upgrade their space, Castlery's growth ""accelerated,"" said Ee. ""We were growing so fast, our faces were turning green."" According to Castlery, the company grew ""six times"" during the pandemic, making over $100 millionin the most recent financial year ending March 2022, and was profitable in 2020.  However, with or without the pandemic, Ee believes that Castlery's biggest selling point is the design and functionality of its products. ""I speak to customers from the U.S. every month and they are like, 'We love your washable range of sofas!' I thought, 'Okay, it's a thing?'"" ""I guess being Asians, we are quite practical,"" he said. Ee added: ""They would explain that in the U.S., you won't have this option at this price point."" According to him, his furniture is ""20% to 30%"" cheaper than similar pieces in the market. That is achieved through a ""rigorous process refined over the years,"" said Ee. ""Each collection is assigned a buyer, an engineer and a planner — this trio runs a well-oiled machine to ensure products go to market in a timely and cost-efficient manner."" He added: ""[The] buyer finds the best in class manufacturers to work with. Engineers redesign inefficient processes while a planner works to source materials at the best possible price point.""

2022.6.28,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/28/climeworks-carbon-dioxide-removal-company-building-iceland-plant.html,"Carbon dioxide removal startup Climeworks announced on Tuesday it is building a second commercial-sized plant in Iceland. When fully operational in 18 to 24 months, the plant will capture and store 36,000 metric tons per year of carbon dioxide, the company says. That amounts to a minuscule percentage of the total global emissions of carbon dioxide released into the air each year: In 2021, they hit a record high of 36.3 billion metric tons, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental energy organization. But this new factory, alongside a smaller one in Iceland that has the capacity to remove 4,000 tons a year, are just the first steps Climeworks is taking toward its goal of removing multiple millions of tons of carbon dioxide a year by 2030, and 1 billion tons per year by 2050. Those targets are many orders of magnitude higher than where Climeworks is right now, but as co-founder and co-CEO JanWurzbacher told CNBC in May, the team has been at it for 13  years and has seen the technology improve vastly during that time. ""We started with milligrams of carbon dioxide captured from the air. Then we went from milligrams to grams, from grams to kilograms to tons to 1,000 tons. So we did quite a couple of these steps already."" Wurzbacher and Christoph Gebald launched Climeworks in 2009 as a spinoff of ETH Zürich, the main technical university in Switzerland's largest city. The idea of vacuuming carbon dioxide out of the air has been getting more mainstream attention and hundreds of millions of funding recently. In April, payment processor Stripe, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta, Shopify and McKinsey announced they were teaming up to commit to purchase almost $1 billion worth of carbon dioxide removal from companies that are developing the technology. A couple days later, Chris Sacca's climate investment company, Lowercarbon Capital, announced a $350 million fund to invest in carbon removal startups. That kind of momentum in the industry was certainly not the norm when Climeworks started. ""Back in 2009, the environment was definitely very different,"" Wurzbacher told CNBC. ""There was an ongoing climate debate, but it was more a debate about how can we avoid emissions. And when we came up with the method of capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, many people said, 'Hey, wait a minute, let's not waste our time with that.'"" But now, in addition to the private sector investment, the United Nations' leading climate science organization, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), included carbon capture in its April update for addressing global warming. ""Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) is necessary to achieve net zero carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions both globally and nationally, counterbalancing 'hard-to-abate' residual emissions,"" the technical summary of the IPCC recommendations says. ""CDR is also an essential element of scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C or likely below 2°C by 2100, regardless of whether global emissions reach near zero, net zero or net negative levels."" There are other ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere besides vacuuming it from the air. Planting trees is a natural method, but that takes a lot more land than the factories Climeworks is building to remove an equivalent amount of CO2. Also, a tree can die, be cut down or burned after it is planted, making it hard to account for how much CO2 it will actually remove over its lifetime. Carbon dioxide removed from the air mechanically, as Climeworks does, can be permanently stored underground. When Wurzbacher and Gebald were sure that technical carbon dioxide removal would be necessary to respond to climate change, many others were not. ""Of course, there were a lot of skeptics at that point in time,"" Wurzbacher told CNBC. ""We didn't know what would happen or exactly how things would turn out, how long it would take to develop the technology, to scale the technology — but for us, it was somehow clear that this is something that will be needed."" Wurzbacher, 38, was just 25 years old when the company started. ""We just went on and didn't listen too much"" to the doubters, he said. After developing the carbon removal technology in the lab for close to a decade, Climeworks built its first plant in Hinwil, Switzerland, in 2017. At that time, Climeworks sold the carbon dioxide it captured to customers like a local greenhouse for using in fertilizing vegetable growth and to beverage maker Coca-Cola. These kinds of initial niche applications were ""not climate-relevant,"" Wurzbacher told CNBC, but were simply a demonstration of the technology itself. ""From the very beginning, the goal was always to come up with a climate relevant solution,"" Wurzbacher said. Early on, we ""looked for niche applications to get things rolling because there was no market at that point in time for negative emissions."" But years later, as consumers and businesses grew more concerned about climate change, the company began seeing demand. In 2018, Climeworks began allowing individuals to pay anything from $36 to $120 per month to have the company remove some amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on their behalf. So far, more than 14,000 people have signed on. Around the same time, corporate clients including Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify, are doing business with Climeworks in order to demonstrate their climate commitments. Now, Climeworks is primarily removing carbon and storing it underground by mineralizing it with basalt rock. Selling captured carbon dioxide for use in fizzy drinks or in greenhouses, are ""more or less negligible,"" Wurzbacher told CNBC. Carbon removal demand is largely coming from companies who see climate goals — being able to sell a product as either carbon neutral or carbon negative — as a ""vital ingredient to their business in the future,"" Wurzbacher told CNBC. ""Those companies that are currently our customers, they are taking the fact that they are removing carbon from the atmosphere and making that an element of their products and of their services."" In September 2021, Climeworks opened its first commercial direct air carbon capture and storage plant in Iceland. It is composed of eight carbon capturing modules made from 44 shipping containers with filters inside that are able to remove 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Climeworks picked Iceland to open its first plant in part because its carbon storage partner, CarbFix, is based there, and because there are sufficient sources of renewable energy in Iceland. It would be counterproductive to burn fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, to power a carbon removal plant. Until recently, Climeworks was funded by about $150 million of money from private individual investors. But in April, Climeworks announced it raised $650 million from a collection of investors including, among others, Global Founders Capital, John Doerr, and Swiss Re. ""The market for carbon dioxide removal has basically had an exponential development over the past two, two and a half years,"" Wurzbacher told CNBC. ""It's overwhelming basically, what is happening currently."" In addition to ramping up its capacity, Climeworks is also focused on reducing the cost. In the middle of this decade, cost will probably be $500 per ton of carbon dioxide removed. By 2030, the cost will be around $300 per ton and in the middle of next decade, the cost is projected to be about $200 per ton. Currently, Climeworks' business relies on climate-conscious companies and individuals, but government incentives are seen as a way that the company and ones like it could build enough large factories to make a dent in climate change mediation. Governments could also help drive demand in the space through regulated and mandated carbon budgets or a price on carbon. ""Eventually, policy will be required to scale this up,"" Wurzbacher said. For now, Climeworks is focused on reducing the cost of carbon removal and scaling up the Climeworks operation with money from investors. But longer term, ""in order to then roll that out and get from tens of millions of tons to billions of tons, we do need policy and we do need regulation to reach that order of magnitude and that scale,"" he added."
2022.6.28,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/28/droneseed-uses-swarms-of-drones-to-reseed-forests-after-wildfires.html,"Fire seasons are now longer and the destruction more intense, as fires burn hotter and spread to more drought-stricken ground. Since the start of this year, 32,247 wildfires have burned over 3.3 million acres in the United States, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. An early start to the season, and an especially brutal beginning in New Mexico, puts 2022 on the path toward record fire destruction. Historically, fires would leave seeds in the soil and at treetops, but the hotter, more intense fires that occur now burn up the treetops and destroy the seeds in the soil, so there is much less natural regeneration. DroneSeed is a Seattle-based startup that claims it can begin to restore thousands of acres of wildfire-ravaged land just 30 days after the fire is out. ""We're a one-stop shop for reforestation,"" said Grant Canary, CEO of DroneSeed. ""If you're a land manager, and this could be tribal nations, this could be family forests, this can be public lands, this can be timber companies, and you're affected by a wildfire, we're one of your phone calls."" DroneSeed uses seeds as well as seedlings, or young plants, from its own nurseries. It then uses heavy-lift drone swarms to spread them across the scorched land. The drones drop the seeds in contained vessels, called pucks, where they then root and begin to grow into seedlings. These pucks are made out of plant fiber and contain nontoxic elements, such as spicy pepper, to deter rodents and other mammals. Not all of the seeds or seedlings result in trees, and DroneSeed said that seed establishment and growth rates vary at each project site, due to soil conditions, water quality, grade of the terrain, climate temperature, tree species and other factors. Canary likens his fleet of drones to a swarm of bees, navigating rough terrain, that can carry and disperse many thousands of seeds. Each aircraft can plant three-quarters of an acre per flight. In October 2020, the company announced that it was the first to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for this type of forest-seeding activity. ""The aircraft themselves, they are not what you can get at Best Buy. They're eight feet in diameter,"" said Canary. ""They carry a 57-pound payload. We operate them in groups of three to five, and they're going out there and they're dropping seed vessels onto the landscape in pre-surveyed areas."" Key to DroneSeed's model is the seedling production, which has been a major barrier to reforestation due to supply chain issues. DroneSeed recently purchased Silvaseed, one of the oldest seed businesses in the nation, and it is now expanding to become the largest private seed banks in the West, growing millions of seedlings. The company's operations are funded in part by companies purchasing carbon offsets. One such customer is Shopify, which bought enough to remove 50,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere. In turn, DroneSeed is replanting 300 acres of forest lost in Oregon's Beachie Creek fire two years ago. ""That climate benefit of planting those trees and drawing down carbon is what we're purchasing through our carbon credit purchase,"" said Stacy Kauk, Shopify's head of sustainability. ""That allows us to balance out our unabatable emissions from our corporate footprint, such as things like electricity usage or corporate travel."" DroneSeed is backed by 776, DBL Partners, Social Capital, Spero Ventures and Techstars. It has raised $36 million to date."
2022.6.24,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/heres-why-a-multi-million-toy-business-is-venturing-into-the-metaverse.html,"When Jackson Aw was introduced to blockchain technology in 2018, he ""didn't get it at all."" ""Can someone dumb it down even further for me? Like, can you just tell me what I can get as a consumer?"" That was four years ago. Today, Aw, seems to have the answer to that question. The 32-year-old Singaporean, who runs Mighty Jaxx — a multi-million dollar toy company that produces collectibles and lifestyle products — has incorporated blockchain into his products. A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records every transaction that has taken place. It also cannot be tampered with or changed retroactively. CNBC Make It finds out why it ""makes sense"" for the collectibles empire to tap into blockchain capabilities, and bet on the metaverse. Mighty Jaxx, which was founded in 2012, has partnered with some of the biggest global brands and visual artists, producing trendy collectibles that incorporate pop culture and design. Aw said the company has since sold millions of toy collectibles to people in more than 80 countries. Mighty Jaxx's limited-edition collectibles can cost up to $1,200 on its website, but in the secondary marketplace they can fetch ""five to ten times"" more than its original value, said Aw. But there is one problem. ""When you want to sell the product, the number one question everywhere is 'Is it authentic?'"" Aw added: ""For collectibles, what [sellers] do is that they take photos of the figurine and post it on Facebook groups, asking people to do an authenticity check."" However, Aw was not satisfied with this method of authentication. ""Whose word is it on? Where's the provenance of it? So we thought, okay, that's what we need."" Mighty Jaxx designed a near-field communication chip and embedded one into each toy. NFC technology enables short-range, wireless communication between two devices. ""With our app, you can [scan the chip], register your ownership of the item [to show] it's an authentic Mighty Jaxx product,"" Aw said. Powered by blockchain, the platform issues and validates unique, tamperproof certificates for every product. It also provides a digital footprint when ownership of an item changes. ""If Jay Chou or JJ Lin owned that figurine prior to you, that is definitely far more valuable than me owning it,"" Aw jokes. Jay Chou and JJ Lin are popular Mandarin pop singers. Providing reliable authentication through blockchain technology is just ""the beginning"" for Mighty Jaxx. With the nonfungible token market seeing explosive growth in 2021, Aw said that was when there was ""a change in culture as we knew it."" ""[Being] artists and creators in general … has always been more of a service-based work. But now it flipped. Now, content and intellectual property is key, because without any of this [visual] representation, that technology does nothing,"" Aw explained. ""Nothing speaks louder than visual form."" NFTs are crypto-based digital assets that also function like collectibles — something that Mighty Jaxx is no stranger to. Hence, it ""makes sense"" for Aw to venture into the space, by offering fans exclusive digital experiences with physical collectibles. ""When you buy our NFTs, you get access and the opportunity to purchase the physical manifestation of it in that design. So only this bunch of people would be able to purchase this figure,"" said Aw. ""Because only they could do it and they can combine both asset classes together, it generates even higher value for them."" Aw believes that is Mighty Jaxx's ""phygital"" edge over its competitors — being able to offer both digital and physical assets. ""The fact that we create digital assets before we produce the physical toys … means that we can go to market quicker as well,"" he added. ""I can't think of, you know, 10 other companies doing that in the whole world, simply because the work that goes into creating a hardware or a [physical] collectible, it's naturally just a steeper learning curve."" In 2021, Mighty Jaxx launched its first collection of NFT trading cards, featuring cats that look like the Chinese cuisine, dim sum. ""We launched 6,000 units, within … two seconds, they were just sold out,"" Aw said. Mighty Jaxx got its big break with DC Comics by scoring a licensing partnership in 2015, allowing it to ""restyle"" the creative intellectual property. Since then, it has partnered with renowned brands to reach fandoms all around the world, from Adidas, Hasbro and Nickelodeon, to Formula 1, Sesame Street and Netflix. Aw says ""there's a lot more work to be done,"" with plans to expand its IP collaborations into the metaverse as well. The metaverse is a set of virtual worlds where people live, work and play. ""There are certain IPs that are universally liked, like BTS, Marvel and so on. But if we look at Southeast Asia, we all grew up with different, cultural differences. And that could be … in the IP that you grew up watching,"" he added. ""There is an opportunity for us to localize that part of things. That's the whole intention [of the metaverse], that anyone, anywhere can enjoy owning a particular asset in a totally decentralized way.""

2022.6.23,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/23/epic-cleantec-san-francisco-wastewater-recycling-start-up.html,"The bulk of water recycling now happens at centralized wastewater treatment plants, requiring thousands of miles of pipelines to move the water. This practice is neither efficient nor cheap. But as more municipalities begin to require water recycling in commercial and residential buildings, companies are stepping up with new methods of on-site water recycling. San Francisco-based startup Epic Cleantec is one of them. It is attempting to move the water industry to a ""circular approach,"" according to its founder, by helping buildings recover and reuse wastewater on site. The company's system removes solids from wastewater and turns them into soil, then treats the water to be clean enough for uses like toilet flushing, irrigation, cooling towers or laundry. It is not clean enough to drink. ""We are capturing all the dirty water that you would normally send into the sewer, and we're turning that into clean water, into soil, and into recovered wastewater heat,"" said CEO Aaron Tartakovsky. ""We are helping these buildings to recycle up to 95% of their water so that is 95% less fresh drinking water we have to pull in from the city supply, and we can instead recycle water right on site, right where it's produced."" Tartakovsky argues that the ""flush and forget"" society needs an overhaul, as climate change produces more severe and prolonged droughts. The American West is in the midst of the worst drought in 1,200 years, according to a recent reportpublishedin the journal Nature Climate Change. ""We are going to be saving folks on their water and their sewer rates. And we typically aim to give buildings a return on their investment of under seven years,"" he added. San Francisco recently passed a law requiring every new building over 100,000 square feet to have a water-recycling system. There are similar requirements in Los Angeles, and programs like it are cropping up in Denver, Austin, Texas, and New York City. That's the reason why Related, a major national real estate developer and landlord, is using Epic. Its water-recycling system was installed at 1550 Mission, a 39-story, 550-unit apartment building in San Francisco completed in 2020. The building can now reuse over 2.5 million gallons of water every year, according to Related. That's 2.5 million gallons it does not need to draw from the city's water supply. ""Water conservation being such a critical issue, it's actually a really great value-add to our design proposition and something that residents look for, for our buildings to be sustainable,"" said Phoebe Yee, an executive vice president of design at Related California. Residential water and sewer rates in the U.S. have outpaced inflation by nearly 300% over the last two decades, while growing urban populations are straining the aging municipal water infrastructure. ""We definitely see it as a cost-effective system in the long run, and since we are developing for the long term, those are important considerations,"" said Yee. ""There is always an initial cost that goes in, and that's our investment, and because we own our buildings and operate them for years and years, the payback is important."" Epic Cleantec is backed by J-Ventures, J-Impact, Echo River Capital and LL&P, Inc. It has raised just over $13 million to date."

""This is a particularly challenging market for founders to get started,"" Abheek Anand, managing director of Sequoia Southeast Asia, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday. When asked about the firm's outlook for Southeast Asia's start-ups, Anand said its early-stage investments this and next year are ""going to be playing [in] where the markets will be 10 years from now."" ""Pretty much every metric on technology continues to grow and secularly grow in the long term."" On Tuesday, Sequoia announced it raised $2.85 billion across a set of funds focused on India and Southeast Asia. That includes its first dedicated fund for Southeast Asia, with a pool of $850 million. ""This fundraise, which comes at a time when markets are starting to cool after a very long bull run, signals our deep commitment to the region,"" the firm said. Despite the shaky short-term outlook, Anand said founders in Southeast Asia still have ""growing ambitions."" ""For example, you're starting to see a lot of companies get started in Southeast Asia, but … serving regional and global market."" He added that ""a new generation of founders"" is also emerging, as the first generation of tech companies like GoTo and Grab have gone public. ""Their [executives] are now starting new companies and these are seasoned operators … They're frankly, aiming higher than the companies that they came from,"" Anand explained. However, what will change for new start-ups and founders would be their ""access to capital"" and hence, short-term strategy. ""This period of free capital or very cheap capital that resulted in certain design choices that the big companies got built on, that's going to likely not be present in the next year,"" he said. ""Founders just have to be more sensible, more focused on fundamentals, more focused on durable and enduring business models."" Anand said that Sequoia's focus as long-term investors is building ""strong corporate governance."" ""I would characterize our market as sort of through little bit of its teenage years … lots of companies are getting created and we're all working together to get to a place where the market is more mature,"" he added.

Klarna gives customers the option of when to pay for an item — they can pay upfront, pay in installments or delay payment for a certain period of time. Critics say this enables people to buy things they might not necessarily be able to afford, although Klarna says it runs affordability checks to ensure that consumers can pay them back. In an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday, the Swedish entrepreneur said BNPL is ""superior"" to the credit card model, claiming that the average Klarna user has an outstanding balance of $50, whereas the average credit card user has an outstanding balance of $5,000. Siemiatkowski went on to say his business is ""extremely recession-proof"" compared with traditional credit card firms. However, the fintech reported a loss of $748 million last year and last month announced that it was laying off around 10% of its 6,500 staff as part of an effort to cut costs. On top of that, Klarna will soon be competing with Apple in the BNPL sector after the iPhone maker announced this week that it plans to enter the market with a new product called Apple Pay Later. That puts BNPL players like PayPal, Affirm and Klarna in an awkward spot. The fear is that Apple, a $2 trillion company and the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer, could draw clients away from such services. Shares of Affirm have sunk 17% so far this week on the news. ""I think it's a final, massive embracement of what to me is a much healthier form of credit,"" Siemiatkowski said of Apple's entry into the market."

Serai, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Europe's biggest bank, that connected small-and-medium-sized apparel makers with component suppliers worldwide, was HSBC's first investment in a non-banking tech startup. ""The decision to wind down Serai follows a thorough business review and is a purely commercial decision,"" HSBC said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday but did not give details of Serai's business or its investment in the company. Just months after Serai was launched in June 2019, political unrest in Hong Kong triggered protests that dealt a blow to businesses, followed by the Covid-19 pandemic that battered global supply chains. Serai also confirmed its closure in a notice on its website and said its services would not be available from June 25. ""We regret to inform you that Serai will be winding down all operations,"" it said. ""Despite a huge amount of progress made by the team, it has proven difficult to build a commercially viable business. As a result, we've made the difficult decision to close our doors,"" Serai said. HSBC had invested around $70 million into the start-up in the last three years, two sources familiar with the matter said, adding that Serai had started to wind up its business over the last few weeks. Serai's platform connected buyers and sellers in the highly fragmented clothing and garments industry. Veteran trade banker Vivek Ramachandran, who previously worked at HSBC's commercial banking business, was the CEO of Serai. Last month, Ramachandran returned to HSBC to head its Global Trade and Receivables Finance unit. Serai's platform offered financial, environmental, social and corporate governance metrics along with analytics to enable traceability from finished products to raw materials."
2022.6.7,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/checkoutcom-jumps-into-crypto-with-stablecoin-payments-feature.html,"In this article AMSTERDAM — Online payments company Checkout.com says it will settle payments for its merchants round-the-clock using stablecoins, making it the last major financial services firm taking the plunge into crypto. The start-up, which competes with the likes of PayPal and Stripe, said Tuesday it is launching a feature that allows businesses to accept and make payments in USD Coin, a popular stablecoin that's pegged to the U.S. dollar. Checkout.com said it is offering the new payment method through a partnership with Fireblocks, a crypto security firm. Stablecoins are a key part of the crypto market, helping investors trade in and out of digital currencies rapidly without having to go through banks. With a circulating supply of more than $50 billion, USDC is the world's second-biggest stablecoin. The feature will allow merchants to settle payments even on weekends and public holidays, something that's not currently possible with fiat currencies, according to Jess Houlgrave, Checkout.com's head of crypto strategy. She used the example of someone buying bitcoin from a crypto exchange. While the user can get their bitcoin straight away, how banks and card schemes like Visa and Mastercard operate means merchants may not receive the funds for several days. ""Between the time that they've sent the bitcoin, and the time that they receive those funds, they have a working capital constraint,"" Houlgrave told CNBC on the sidelines of the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Amsterdam. Checkout.com said it has tested the feature privately with select clients, facilitating $300 million in transaction volumes in the past few months. It now plans to roll the product out globally, with Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX among the first to use it. Last valued at $40 billion, Checkout.com is the latest major financial institution betting big on crypto. Stripe recently launched its own stablecoin payments feature, allowing Twitter creators to get paid in USDC. Such developments come at a time when cryptocurrencies have tumbled sharply from the peak of a seismic rally last year. Bitcoin has more than halved in value since an all-time high of nearly $70,000 in November. Unlike bitcoin, stablecoins aren't meant to fluctuate that much in price. They're designed to be tied to the value of traditional assets like the dollar. But recent events have put stablecoins' main selling point to the test. Last month, a so-called stablecoin called terraUSD imploded after falling below its intended dollar peg, shaking investors' confidence in cryptocurrencies. TerraUSD, or UST, used code to maintain a price of $1. That's different to more mainstream stablecoins like tether and USDC, which are backed by cash and other assets. Tether, meanwhile, also briefly slipped below a dollar on numerous exchanges as crypto investors fled the token due to panic over the UST debacle. Tether, which has long faced questions over its stablecoin's backing, said it processed more than $10 billion in redemption requests in May. Regulators are getting worried about the phenomenon. Last week, the U.K. government announced new proposals that would give the Bank of England the power to intervene and manage the collapse of certain stablecoins if they pose a risk to financial stability. Stateside, Treasury Janet Yellen also wants the U.S. lawmakers to approve stablecoin regulation by the end of the year."
2022.6.6,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/06/chipotle-and-kraft-use-start-up-howgood-to-track-how-green-they-are.html,"Consumers are now demanding environmental accountability in everything — from the buildings they live in to the products they purchase. Food is a big one. While more and more food companies are claiming that their products are ""sustainable,"" a Stone Ridge, New York-based start-up is taking a close look at those claims. The company is called HowGood. HowGood analyzes thousands of ingredients — more than 33,000 so far, the company says — looking at factors like the product's greenhouse gas emissions, its water usage, land usage, soil biodiversity impact, potential deforestation and concern for animal welfare. Every ingredient in every product has a different level of environmental impact, all of which change region to region. For each product analysis, HowGood takes in close to 250 different attributes from those ingredients and boils them all down to a rating, which companies can then use to improve their products. ""HowGood provides sustainability intelligence,"" said Alexander Gillett, the company's CEO. ""The idea here is that we have the largest database in the world on food sustainability, and companies get to use it now to start making better decisions and to be more transparent."" ""My friends like to say I can ruin any food group,"" Gillett joked. Companies are getting increasingly hungry for this kind of data, both to meet their sustainability goals and because more of their customers are demanding it. Chipotle uses HowGood for its Foodprint, a measure of its carbon footprint, while Kraft Heinz, a new client, is now putting some of its staples under the environmental microscope. ""We're already looking at some really favorable, interesting things with cheese, as well as plant-based alternatives inside that same category,"" said Jonah Smith,global head of environmental social governance (ESG)at Kraft Heinz. ""We're really excited about the possibility that HowGood can really help us, with their extensive catalog, look at more carbon-friendly alternatives to sourcing as well as our other ESG metrics."" While companies like Kraft Heinz and Walmart are buying the deep data to assess their products, consumers can also use the HowGood app to check on the sustainability of products they're buying. Gillett says the company is seeing ""inspiring"" demand from product makers for the data, but he admits that a very small fraction — less than 5 % — of the millions of products in the HowGood database actually get a top rating.  ""Most companies mainly complain that we rate them too harshly. And we're OK with that. We're OK with it being hard. It's a hard problem to solve, and I think the great thing is those companies say that, but then they trust it,"" he said. HowGood has a staff of about 40 now but expects to triple that in the coming year. Its backers include Titan Grove, Firstmark Capital, Serious Change, Danone Manifesto Ventures, Contour Venture Partners, Great Oaks Venture Capital and Astanor Ventures. The company has raised $26.5 million so far."
2022.6.2,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/02/nuclear-waste-us-could-power-the-us-for-100-years.html,"There is enough energy in the nuclear waste in the United States to power the entire country for 100 years, and doing so could help solve the thorny and politically fraught problem of managing spent nuclear waste. That's according to Jess C. Gehin, an associate laboratory director at Idaho National Laboratory, one of the government's premier energy research labs. The technology necessary to turn nuclear waste into energy is known as a nuclear fast reactor, and has existed for decades. It was proven out by a United States government research lab pilot plant that operated from the 1960s through the 1990s. For political and economic reasons, the technology has never been developed at commercial scale. Today, there's an increased urgency to address climate change by decarbonizing out energy grids, and nuclear power has become part of the clean energy zeitgeist. As a result, nuclear fast reactors are once again getting a serious look. ""It feels like it's real — or realer — than it has ever has been to me,"" said Brett Rampal, a nuclear energy expert at Segra Capital Management and Veriten. He did his senior project at the University of Florida on the subject in 2007 and remembers his professors arguing about the future of the technology even then. There are 93 commercial nuclear reactors at 55 operating sites in the United States, according to Scott Burnell, spokesperson for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Twenty-six are in some stage of decommissioning process. All of the nuclear reactors that operate in the U.S. are light-water reactor designs, Burnell told CNBC. In a light-water reactor, uranium-235 fuel powers a fission reaction, where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller nuclei and releases energy. The energy heats water, creating steam which is used to power a generator and produce electricity. The nuclear fission reaction leaves waste, which is radioactive and has to be maintained carefully. There are about 80,000 metric tonnes of used fuel from light-water nuclear reactors in the United States and the existing nuclear fleet produces approximately an additional 2,000 tons of used fuel each year, Gehin told CNBC. But after a light-water reactor has run its reactor powered by uranium-235, there is still tremendous amount of energy potential still available in what is left. ""Fundamentally, in light-water reactors, out of the uranium we dig out of the ground, we use a half a percent of the energy that's in the uranium that's dug out of the ground,"" Gehin told CNBC in a phone interview. ""You can get a large fraction of that energy if you were to recycle the fuel through fast reactors."" Fast reactors don't slow down the neutrons that are released in the fission reaction, and faster neutrons beget more efficient fission reactions, Gehin told CNBC. ""Fast neutron reactors can more effectively convert uranium-238, which is predominantly what's in spent fuel, to plutonium, so you can fission it,"" Gehin said. The technology for fast nuclear reactors has exited for more than fifty years. A fast reactor plant called the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II), began construction in 1958 and operated from 1964 to 1994, until Congress shut down funding. ""We ran the EBR II reactor out at the site for 30 years, recovered uranium, put it back in the reactor,"" Gehin told CNBC. ""It's been proven that it can be done. The trick would be going to commercial scale to ensure that it is done economically. It's very safe technology. All the basis for the technology has been proven."" While a fast reactor will reduce the amount of nuclear waste, it does not eliminate it entirely. ""There would still be waste that would have to be disposed, but the amount of long-lived waste can be significantly reduced,"" Gehin said. In the middle of the last century, nuclear energy was seen as a solution to the eventual exhaustion of limited fossil fuel supplies. At the same time, there were concerns that there would not be enough uranium to fuel the conventional nuclear reactors that the United States would need. Fast reactors were developed as a solution to both problems: They create large amounts of energy and use only minimal amounts of uranium fuel, Gehin told CNBC. But things changed. ""We started discovering there's actually quite a bit of uranium. And so there wasn't such a need to use it as as effectively,"" Gehin said. Here are stocks to play a 'new era' for nuclear power, according to SocGen Energy stocks are on a roll. But this one has the balance sheet to beat them all, says Citi One little-known lithium battery stock has the potential to surge more than 400%, Loop Capital says Then, nuclear energy as a whole started falling out of favor, largely because of the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979, Gehin said. In addition, economics were a factor. Coal, and later natural gas, remained abundant and cheap. Fast reactors were generally thought to be more expensive than traditional light-water reactors, said Gehin, making it an unattractive area for investment. ""The development of the first commercial fast reactors in the U.S. also suffered from cost overruns,"" Gehin said. Fast forward to 2022. With energy prices spiking thanks to Russia's war in Ukraine, and with the growing public cry to move toward sources of energy that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, nuclear power is getting another look. At the same time, innovators are looking at redesigning fast reactor technology to make it more cost-effective, Gehin said. Currently, Russia is the only country producing electricity with fast reactor technology. India and China have plans to build out commercial fast reactors in the future. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy announced it was building its own fast-spectrum test reactor, the Versatile Test Reactor, but it was not funded in the fiscal year 2022 omnibus funding bill. By not having a pilot test facility in the U.S. for almost 30 years, the U.S. is ""effectively yielding leadership to Russia, China, and India who have this critical capability,"" the Office of Nuclear Energy said in a written statement May. While the government is moving slowly, start-ups Oklo and TerraPower and energy giant Westinghouse are working on fast reactor technologies. Even as private companies are working to innovate and commercialize fast reactor designs, there are significant infrastructure hurdles. Before nuclear waste can be used to power fast reactors, it has to go through reprocessing. Right now, only Russia has the capacity to do this at scale. France, too, has the capacity to recycle used nuclear waste, Gehin said, but the country generally takes its recycled fuel and puts it back into existing light water reactors. For now, the Idaho National Lab can reprocess enough fuel for research and development, Gehin told CNBC, but not much more. Private companies commercializing fast reactor technology are pushing for domestic fuel supply chains to be developed. TerraPower says it's investing in supply chains and working with elected leaders to build political support, while Oklo has received three government awards and is working with the government to commercialize fast reactor fuel supply chains domestically. The other option to power fast reactors is to create HALEU fuel, which stands for high-assay low-enriched uranium, from scratch, rather than by recycling nuclear waste. (Where conventional reactors use uranium enriched up to 5%, HALEU is uranium enriched up to 20%.) It's arguably easier to produce HALEU directly than by recycling spent waste, says Gehin, but ultimately, the cheaper option will win out. ""It will be largely be driven by what makes sense economically."" Regardless, Russia is the only country that has the capacity to make HALEU at commercial scale. Oklo CEO and co-founder Jacob DeWitte says he's bullish on recycled fuel, even if it comes after commercial-scale HALEU production. ""This looks quite promising to be economically more attractive than fresh fuel,"" DeWitte told CNBC. ""This process works using electrorefining to electrochemically recycle the transuranics and uranium in the waste into feed material for fuel. We aim for this facility will be operational in the latter part of the decade."""
2022.6.1,cnbc.com,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/european-vcs-are-urging-start-ups-in-their-portfolios-to-cut-costs.html,"European venture capitalists are advising start-ups in their portfolios to cut costs and freeze hiring as economists warn that another recession is inevitable. Their counterparts in Silicon Valley are doing the same. Following a bumper 2021 that was full of IPOs and mega funding rounds, some of the most valuable start-ups in Europe are now laying off significant numbers of staff and drastically scaling back their expansion plans. ""The general advice is to extend [the] runway,"" Michael Stothard, an early-stage start-up investor at Firstminute Capital in London, told CNBC. That means they either need to cut their costs or try to raise more capital if they're able to, he added. Nathan Benaich, a venture capitalist at Air Street Capital in London, said that the industry overall has been advising companies to be more conservative rather than encouraging the go-go plans of yesteryear. ""On my side, I think it makes sense to focus on what's working in the business today vs. planning longer term bets until we get a better read on the market,"" he told CNBC. Fred Destin, founder of VC firm Stride, told CNBC that the advice being offered differs from start-up to start-up but generally he is urging entrepreneurs in his portfolio to cut costs where they can. ""Lower expected demand and slower funding markets really demand action"" said Destin, who has led investments into European unicorns like food delivery service Deliveroo, property platform Zoopla and car retailer Cazoo. There are signs that founders may be listening to their investors, who often hold seats on their board. Swedish fintech giant Klarna, which became Europe's most valuable start-up last June when it was valued at $46 billion, announced last week that it is planning to lay off about 10% of its global workforce. The buy-now-pay-later firm, which employs around 6,500 people worldwide, is reportedly looking to raise more money at a significantly lower valuation of around $30 billion. There is a paradox in the fundraising space. Data from VC analysis firm Pitchbook shows that VCs have more cash than ever, yet they are scaling back their investments to see how the economic climate develops. Oscar White, CEO and founder of travel tech platform Beyonk, told CNBC that this presents an issue for founders that raised money at high valuations during the Covid pandemic and are set to run out of cash in the next year. ""They are likely going to have to raise on a down round if we do go into a recession,"" White said, adding that the guidance for portfolio companies from many VCs is to focus on capital efficient growth and aim to have runway through 2024. ""I'm optimistic we will continue to raise and be able to invest in growth because investing won't completely stop,"" White said, adding that it will just become more competitive. With tech stockscrateringthrough the first five months of 2022 and the Nasdaq stock market on pace for its second-worst quarter since the 2008 financial crisis, start-up investors are telling their portfolios that they aren't immune to the fallout. Start-up incubator Y Combinator, which helped to create Airbnb and Stripe, said last week that companies have to ""understand that the poor public market performance of tech companies significantly impacts VC investing."" ""It will be a longer recovery and while we can't predict how long, we can advise you on ways to prepare and get through to the other side,"" Sequoia Capital, the iconic venture firm known for early bets onGoogle,Appleand WhatsApp, wrote last month in a 52-pagepresentationtitled ""Adapting to Endure,"" a copy of which CNBC obtained. Hussein Kanji, a partner at Hoxton Ventures, told CNBC that European start-ups are only just starting to get the message. ""I think people only got the memo in Europe last week or the week before,"" he said. Elsewhere in Europe, the rapid grocery delivery boom is coming to a grinding halt. Last week, two of the largest instant grocery apps, Getir and Gorillas, announced decisions to lay off hundreds of employees. Another firm, Zapp, said it is proposing redundancies in its U.K. team."

2022.5.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/harnessing-the-power-of-agriculture-to-protect-the-planet-interview-with-robin-saluoks/,"Robin Saluoks is the co-founder and CEO of eAgronom, a startup that’s transforming the voluntary carbon offset market and accelerating the transition to net-zero. Founded in Estonia in 2016 as a Farm Management Software (FMS), the company is one of the leading agritech companies in the Baltics and Poland. Across the world, it’s becoming more and more clear that large-scale adoption of sustainable farming practices is required to help save our planet. However, financial constraints and complex regulations remain key barriers for many farmers to make a move – and too much of the pressure is falling on the shoulders of this sector. At the same time, carbon offsetting has come under increased scrutiny due to a lack of transparency and measurability. Coming from farming roots, Robin developed eAgronom to solve these problems and harness the power of agriculture to protect the planet. We sat down with Robin to find out more about his inspiring and innovative approach to impact-driven business. Congrats on raising your Series A! Farming and technology are not usually two words that are readily thought about together. What was your initial inspiration behind founding eAgronom? The beginnings of eAgronom were quite accidental and came about when my father broke his computer. Today’s farmers rely heavily on computers for the running of their businesses, but unfortunately, the software my father was using to manage his farm was connected to his physical computer and it was a costly mission to transfer the data to a new machine. At that point, I entered the story. Since I was still studying computer science at university, I programmed the first version of a SaaS-based farm management software for my father’s exclusive use. However, other farmers got wind of it and wanted to start using it too. Recognising my own limitations, I engaged Stenver Jerkku’s help to assist me in developing a scalable product and eAgronom was born! eAgronom originally started as a Farm Management Software. You are now expanding to provide a carbon credits programme for farmers. Can you share more about how you decided to shift the business in that direction? Being part of a carbon offsetting programme provides extra income to farmers by assisting the process of soil sequestration. Our technology provides transparent, real-time measurement capabilities for carbon projects. However, for farmers to become more sustainable, it requires substantial upfront investments and access to finance as the process of carbon credit certification takes an average of five years. This involves huge risks and uncertainty over future payouts, making involvement in carbon projects unappealing to most farmers in its current state. Working closely with the farming community over the last few years, we realised financing often constitutes an insurmountable barrier to adopting more sustainable practices and onboarding to a carbon programme. This is the conundrum we are trying to solve. We are in the process of launching the blockchain-based carbon protocol Solid World DAO, which will focus on buying pre-certified carbon credits that will in turn help finance new carbon sequestration projects on farms. With the help of eAgronom’s farm management software, AI and remote sensing technologies, farmers are able to provide accurate, transparent, and real-time progress of their carbon projects to ensure they are on track to become certified. This process ensures there are only winners: investors can be confident their investments are of high-quality, farmers will become wealthier, the food they produce will be healthier, and the environment will benefit by agriculture becoming a positive contributor to soil health and conservation. Farming is often (perhaps sometimes wrongly) associated with contributing to climate change. How does eAgronom help farmers become more sustainable? The farming industry is indeed a major polluter. However, it has immense potential not only to clean up its act but also to be a positive contributor to our natural environment. Soils are the largest carbon sink outside oceans, and sequestering carbon into agricultural soil via photosynthesis is a key natural means to fight climate change. Large-scale adoption of sustainable farming practices is required, such as crop rotation, undersowing, reduced fuel usage, till and fertilization, amongst others. eAgronom’s farm management software, AI and remote sensing technologies allow farmers to become more sustainable and get paid for creating fully measurable, transparent, and high-quality carbon credits.  When you first started you raised funds directly from farmers. How important was that to you and do you continue to work closely with farmers when developing your products? We raised €500k from 50 of our first customers, which was an incredibly humbling experience and it gave us the confirmation we needed that we were onto something good. I am the son and grandson of farmers, so it’s in my blood. Whenever I go abroad, I make sure I visit farms to get an understanding of the unique challenges the farmers there face. eAgronom’s consultancy arm is an important part of our business and our agronomical advisors are in constant communication with our customers to understand their needs and what they require from us to work better. The personal relationship we have with our farmers is incredibly important; our success depends on their success and vice versa. Agritech and climatetech are getting a lot of attention from the investment community in recent times. How has this changed from when you first launched eAgronom and does investment being more readily available make you think differently about your business? Indeed, both the AgriTech and ClimateTech markets are bursting with innovation and are being courted by investors. We were lucky enough to have fantastic support from investors from early on, and continue to do so, but we have seen the whole industry explode around us. It has finally dawned on the tech industry that we should be using technology to save the planet rather than build one extra gadget that we never knew we needed to make our lives a little bit more convenient. Many graduates don’t want to flock to Silicon Valley anymore to work on developing yet another business process application; they want to do their bit to avoid climate catastrophe. The current buzz around AgTech is fantastic and it allows us to think bigger, faster, and gives us hope for our collective futures. Launching a new product or pivoting often involves implementing a lot of changes in a business. How did you approach this change within eAgronom? We identify who is the best suited for the job at hand, and if there is a gap, we fill it with a new hire. It’s important to be honest with yourself and understand your own limitations. We have been lucky enough to attract some fantastic brains to our venture from the very start. We are a very dynamic team and things change and move very fast, so it takes a certain kind of personality to keep up with our pace and enthusiasm! Now that you have raised a Series A, how do you see the team and company expanding over the next 12 months? Do you plan to launch in any new markets? With the help of the latest funding round, we are working on expanding our carbon programme globally and accelerating product development, including adding advanced greenhouse gas tracking tools into our software. We are also testing and piloting additional green financing opportunities for farmers, specifically in the agroforestry space. What are you most excited about as a business at the moment? We are very excited about the prospect of helping onboard farmers to carbon programmes that ordinarily would not have had the chance. Agriculture has immense potential to be a positive contributor to the natural world, and we are proud to be supplying some of the tools to fight climate change."
2022.5.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/spanish-startup-erasmus-play-scores-e200k-to-make-international-student-housing-stress-free/,"Studying abroad is one of the highlights of a student’s career. It brings the opportunity for young people to see the world, experience a new culture, and get an international perspective. It’s become a key part of many degree programmes and the Erasmus programme is incredibly popular year after year. But, there is always one catch. Finding accommodation. Every year, many students make the trip abroad only to find themselves struggling to find suitable, reliable and affordable housing. Spanish startup, Erasmus Play, wants to fix this and has developed a housing search engine specifically for students. The team, who were one of the finalists in our pitch competition this year, recently closed an investment round of €200k. Funding for the Zaragoza-based company was led by Didi Value Partners and has had the support of investors such as Daniel Giménez (co-founder of Trovit, Niumba, among others), Gerard Olivé (Wallapop, Glovo, Prontopiso, etc.), Marc Bigas (Skitude), Enrique Domínguez (Trovit and Parkingdoor) and other Business Angels. Toubkal Partners, an investment fund for technology companies in Spain, has also participated in this round. Founded in 2020 by David Casanova Ronco (CEO), Manuel Herrero Gajón (CTO) and Smith Donkor (COO), the startup is taking away the stress of studying abroad. The idea came about when all three of the founders themselves found physical, social and linguistic barriers that made it difficult to find accommodation as international students. The platform comprises an analysis and comparison system that breaks down hurdles in finding student accommodation broad. Smith Donkor, COO and co-founder of Erasmus Play states: “I didn’t have the opportunity to go to Paris on Erasmus because there was no affordable accommodation I could find and almost felt for a fraudulent housing ad. Our mission is to take this obstacle off the plate of international students” This investment will be dedicated to improving the technology of the platform in order to optimize user experience, it will furthermore strengthen relationships with accommodation providers, which are very diversified geographically. The fresh funding makes it possible to bolster the position of Erasmus Play in European countries such as Spain, Italy, France and Germany, alongside increasing the verified accommodation offer in more than 500 cities in which the housing search engine currently has a presence."
2022.5.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/stockholm-based-lassie-fetches-e11-million-for-its-pioneering-preventative-pet-health-insurance/,"Any pet owner will be able to confirm it – our pets become part of our family and their health is just as important as the owners. Increasingly, people are becoming pet parents and are prepared to invest in all aspects of their pet’s care – from how they are fed, to insurance, to toys and beyond. It’s meant that a new area of innovation has sprung up – PetTech. PetTech startup Lassie is one of the pioneers in the European pet health insurance market. The Stockholm-based team recently secured €11 million in a round led by Felix Capital with participation from existing investors Inventure and Passion Capital among prominent angels such as Josefin Landgård (co-founder KRY & Mantle), Fredrik & Caroline Hjelm (VOI siblings) and Karl-Johan Persson (Chair H&M). During the days of lockdown and pandemic, more homes welcomed fur-babies into the family and pet adoptions surged across the continent – this resulted in a follow-on peak in activity in pet health. It’s now estimated that 7/10 of pet owners (according to Lassie’s research) take their pet’s physical and mental health more seriously than their own. Lassie wants to contribute to this – by offering pet insurance that focuses on helping pet parents keep their beloved pets healthy. The aim is to reduce vet costs and prevent problems or injuries from happening in the first place. It’s estimated that 40% of pet health issues are preventable! Founded in 2020 by Hedda Båverud Olsson and Sophie Wilkinson alongside Johan Jönsson, Lassie made it onto our list of female-founded startups to watch this year, thanks to its unique approach to pet insurance. Through the app, owners can attend training on how to prevent common injuries and pet health courses. Doing so rewards users with a lower insurance premium. Since 80% of all of its insurance customers use the app and more than half have completed educational courses, Lassie has already established a large database on pet health, enabling the company to make market-leading discoveries about preventive health. Lassie has also launched Tass Fund, which distributes pet insurance to people who cannot afford to insure their pets. Since launch just last year, the insurance providers now have over 10k customers – helping avoid preventable pet problems. This freshly fetched funding will be used to scale the business beyond Sweden as well as strengthen its product and tech development. Lassie co-founder and CEO Hedda Båverud Olsson, commented: “After some amazing first months we are grateful for the feedback from customers and it’s clear how much they want a service like Lassie. We see a big shift as now people start to view their insurance as something that can help prevent illnesses. We are now looking to bring more products to market and take our preventive pet insurance beyond Sweden. For this internationalisation push, it’s great to add Felix to our team given their strong track record of scaling great consumer products and brands.” Susan Lin, Partner at Felix Capital added: “Over the past decade, we’ve seen a continued shift in modern family structures and attitudes towards pets as an increasingly critical member of the family. Along with tremendous interest and engagement in preventive health and wellness, these trends have only been further accelerated through COVID-19. We are thrilled to partner with the Lassie team to build the leading digital pet insurer and health platform of choice for modern pet parents. Lassie showcases the attributes of companies we love to back – a passionate and experienced founding team with exceptional founder-market fit, truly differentiated product with a distinctive brand, and the opportunity to really become the central pet care platform in a huge and growing market.”"

Bringing this flexible payment offering to the B2B space, Berlin-based Mondu has just secured more than €39.9 million in fresh funding and the young startup is eyeing up international growth. Leading the capital was Valar Ventures with the participation of existing seed investors FinTech Collective, Cherry Ventures, and angel investors from Klarna, Zalando, and SumUp, among others Founded last year in August 2021 by Philipp Povel, Malte Huffmann and Gil Danziger, the German fintech company has been growing fast – already the team counts more than 100 members. Malte Huffmann, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Mondu, explained: “The concept of BNPL isn’t new in the B2B world – offline business trade has enjoyed it for decades. But as more companies increasingly move to digital, the need for BNPL for B2B online will grow immensely. We are on the verge of a “digitalisation boom” and Mondu wants to be part of that revolution by driving innovation within the B2B payments space.” Mondu is entering the space with the aim of simplifying the financial lives of SMBs so that they can focus more time and energy on growing their business and less time on handling financial matters. The Mondu solution for merchants and marketplaces offers flexible payment terms in online checkouts as well as offering the preferred payment methods in the B2B sector. The B2B BNPL market offers a huge market potential on an international scale. In Europe and the US it’s believed to be worth around $200 billion – giving Mondu incredible growth opportunities. BNPL gives businesses the chance to have more flexible payments – and its certainly soaring in popularity. Philipp Povel, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Mondu, added: “While B2B BNPL is behind the consumer BNPL market, we believe there is a $200Bn opportunity just in Europe and the US, which is bigger than the global consumer BNPL market. This Series A and the backing of our European and US investors will support us to rapidly scale our product and customer reach ahead of further expansion in Europe later this year.” Since its launch, the young startup has been focusing on developing an attractive product and building a strong client base. It now has already served thousands of businesses to date, with customers ranging from sectors like beauty and cleaning all the ay to manufacturing and raw materials. What makes Mondu stand out in the space is the commitment to usability. Mondu has built a consumerized product that will drive conversion rates and sales whilst being frictionless for customers. The solution easily integrates with merchants and is accessible through APIs, plug-ins, and checkout widgets. The new funding will enable Mondu to scale its solution for merchants and marketplaces by investing in its product and customer acquisition. Mondu plans to expand into more European countries later this year, starting with Austria this summer."

A key part of this is ensuring that people are more informed and aware of the impact they are having on the environment. On a mission to empower banks and consumers with more transparency and insights, Berlin-based ecolytic has just picked up €13.5 million. The funding was led by Visa, PWC Germany through a fund managed by Segenia Capital, VCM Global Asset Management and btov. Founded in 2020, ecolytiq is giving consumers more ammunition in the fight against climate change with its Sustainability-as-a-Service offering. The startup works in partnership with Visa to offer banks and financial institutions the technology to educate and support consumers to manage their environmental impact. The solution leverages payment data in order to provide customers with data-driven CO2 analysis, context, engagement, offsetting, and sustainable investment advice. Essentially, it gives banks the tech they need to give consumers the information they need in order to reduce negative climate impact. It’s a wonderful example of how startups can work alongside corporates for the greater good. ecolytiq co-founder David Lais, explained: “We founded ecolytiq with the mission to not only educate consumers all over the world about their individual impact on the environment but at the same time empower them to take action.” Clients worldwide trust the ecolytiq technology to encourage their retail banking customers to take effective climate action, helping them shape the kind of future they want. Early adopters include Rabobank, Tatra Bank, Tomorrow Bank, Novus, as well as partners such as Worldline and Tink. In 2021, ecolytiq partnered with Visa on the launch of the Visa Eco Benefits bundle. The embedded carbon footprint tracker allows Visa issuers to add sustainability-focused benefits to existing Visa cardholders, enabling them to understand the impact their spending behaviour is having on the environment, as well as encourage and incentivise sustainable consumption behaviour. Charlotte Hogg, CEO Visa Europe said: “A significant shift is needed towards more sustainable behaviours to meet the global net-zero goals by 2050. A key element to this change starts with providing an individual understanding of the environmental impact of their choices. ecolytiq enables banks and their customers to raise awareness of the positive impact they can make. The company has gone from strength to strength in the past two years and we’re proud to support the next stage of their growth.” The fresh funding will now be used to further expand the Sustainability-as-a-Service solution which is currently available in Europe, Canada, and the US, with the aim to bring the mission to banks all over the world. The impact-driven startup wants to empower consumers internationally to work together to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals and tackle the climate crisis. It’s one that ultimately affects each and every one of us, so each and every one of us needs to be part of the solution. Clemens Koch, Leader of Financial Services at PwC Germany added: “PwC Germany supports initiatives that enable financial institutions and banks to leverage the enormous potential of sustainable transformation. The investment in ecolytiq is in line with our commitment to deliver sustained outcomes for financial organizations, their customers, stakeholders and communities to make a positive and enduring impact.”"

From governments to big businesses and from startups to wider society, moving towards greener living and embedding sustainability into strategies is a top priority. Across the world, countries are striving to reach climate goals aimed at protecting the planet for the future. Green startups and scaleups are playing a crucial role in helping countries reach their ambitious sustainability goals. From mobility to green procurement, climate startups are already building solutions that transform governments and economies. However, they are still more often part of a VC’s agenda rather than regular visitors to governmental corridors. According to an analysis by Atomico and Dealroom, climate action has been by far the most popular focus across the purpose-driven investments in startups. Although access to public sector clients and testing opportunities is a clear next step for scaling, startups struggle to work with the public sector, especially in Europe, according to the World Economic Forum. There is one programme trying to change that – The Global Scale-up Programme Global Scale-up Programme (GSUP) is an access programme bringing together around 10 participating governments and up to 20 innovative companies from around the world to address pertinent climate challenges. It was initiated by Lithuania’s GovTech Lab together with Scotland and other countries from the CivTech Alliance. After the great success of the first iteration, it’s now being launched for the second time. The GSUP is aimed at fast-growth scaleups with more mature products which can be scaled at pace given the right access to key government stakeholders. The programme enables access to governments, the public sector, procuring agencies and innovation ecosystems in multiple locations. For the companies that join and collaborate, it’s an incredible chance to be in front of some of the leading innovation teams from governments around the world. It provides access to ecosystems companies would not otherwise have access to. Last year the programme resulted in major victories for participating companies – including accelerated investment due to exposure on GSUP and COP26, multi-million dollar deals with one of the Brazilian states and a $15m Series A funding or contract won with a Lithuanian municipality. This year’s programme This year, the programme is looking for scaleups that can solve one of the two climate-focused challenges. The solutions should either answer the question of how communities can use data and technology to make ‘nature-smart’ choices and drive scalable green growth, or help figure out how data and technology can help the public sector procure greener services and reduce the environmental impact of the supply chain. The open call lasts until the 6th of June. More information can be found here. GovTech Lab Lithuania is a project funded by the European Regional Development Fund.

2022.5.30,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/swedish-startup-stilride-gears-up-to-bring-its-green-origami-manufacturing-tech-to-industry/,"STILRIDE is a Stockholm-based startup that has developed a pioneering approach to environmentally-friendly mobility. Today, the company has just announced the launch of a parent company through which its ‘industrial origami’ tech will be made accessible to designers, architects, manufacturers and engineers. Founded in 2019 by Tue Beijer and Jonas Nyvang, STILRIDE produces cutting-edge electromobility products using STILFOLD technology with the aim of reimaging how high-performance electric-mobility products are manufactured and distributed. The young startup uses cutting-edge steelwork, advanced robotics and ambitious design to fold single sheets of recyclable steel into intricate, lightweight and durable new structures – significantly reducing the environmental impact of production. Now, they have launched STILFOLD in response to growing demands for the tech. Back in January, the company picked up €2.9 million and has been growing fast since. Jonas Nyvang, co-founder and CEO at STILFOLD, explained: “We always envisioned separating the STILFOLD and STILRIDE brands to differentiate our products from the technology itself. But we didn’t imagine we’d be in a position to make this move so early on in our journey. We’re immensely excited to be able to affect this change, as it signals a new phase for the business where we can finally share our technology with industry players and kickstart the ‘green steel’ revolution.” Through STILFOLD, designers and manufacturers will be able to use specially-designed fittings for robotic arms to fold sheets of steel over curves, significantly reducing the environmental impact of production. STILFOLD’s specialist software will enable designers to simulate folding and unfolding their desired structure from a metal sheet, before programming the robotic arms to carry out the complex folding process. The vision behind the launch is to empower designers, architects and manufacturers with the tools to design and engineer everything from buildings and bridges to kitchen appliances in a sustainable way, using cutting-edge steelwork, robotics and innovative design. It’s thought that manufacturing processes account for roughly 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so the young company’s solution certainly has the potential to make a great impact. The potential applications for the technology are diverse. STILRIDE is already using STILFOLD to build a hotly anticipated e-motorbike – the Sport Utility Scooter One (SUS1) – which will go on pre-series release this autumn. The technology has been shown to significantly reduce the climate impact of production. For example, the development of SUS1 found that using STILFOLD requires 70% fewer components – driving a 25% reduction in labour costs and 20% reduction in material costs. It also has a smaller carbon footprint because the production process allows for the steel sheets to be flat-packed and shipped to small, local workshops to be folded close to the end consumer. Already, the climate impact of developing the SUS1’s chassis is 50% lower than that of traditional scooters. Jonas Nyvang added: “We are extremely passionate about electromobility. But early on we knew the potential for this technology to go beyond just EVs. Using STILFOLD, manufacturers across all industries can minimise resource consumption and waste, cut labour costs and ultimately reduce the environmental impact of production: which is a key mission for everyone in the industry in the midst of the climate crisis. We sit at the intersection of technology, electromobility, manufacturing and design – and we want to help each of these industries become more sustainable, without compromising on quality craftsmanship, innovation or style.” There are already over 100,000 people signed up on the waiting list, showing a really promising future for this young company. The team are also running pilots with multinational design and manufacturing brands including a major trailer manufacturer, which are looking for innovative new ways to reduce their impact on the planet."
2022.5.30,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/danish-startup-legal-desk-lands-e3-1-million-for-its-fully-digital-legal-platform/,"The legal world is one associated with lawyers and paperwork, and, for many SMBs, it can be a bit of a headache. Aiming to change this, by bringing legal services into the digital era, Copenhagen-based Legal Desk has just secured €3.1 million in a Series A round. Founded in 2016 by Simon Eklund and Anders Lyager Kaae, the aim is to democratize access to legal services. For too long legal services have been limited to the ones who can afford them and who have time to meet with lawyers (physically or by the phone) Legal Desk provides a platform for fully automated legal services that enables companies and individuals to have easy access to legal services such as company establishment, employment contracts, wills and future power of attorney. It can all be done 24/7 and at the fraction of the cost of consulting a lawyer. Already more than 135k users are registered on the platform, finding it much simpler than traditional legal methods. Being fully digital, it’s also representing a new era of legal help for private companies and SMBs – one where a lawyer isn’t necessarily needed. In 2021, Legal Desk expanded into Sweden and is now, with this new funding, hoping to increase its presence in Scandinavia with plans to scale into Norway this year before heading to Finland in 2023. The goal is to become the Nordic regions leading provider of automated legal services – an area that which, according to CEO Simon Eklund, there is plenty of untapped potential. Simon explained: “The traditional legal services industry has yet to embrace technology when it comes to providing more standardized legal services. I think we are going to see platforms like ours play a much bigger role – also in interaction with the traditional law practices. Accounting, payroll and administration is a clear example of how digitization has become a welcomed part of the practice, and we hope to see the same in our industry. We believe that we can become the primary platform for legal services throughout the Nordic region.” Alongside the new funding, Legal Desk has also just welcomed former Nordic Capital partner, Michael Haaning, to the Board of Directors. Michael commented: “I see great potential in the digitization of legal documents. This applies to both the private and the SME segment, where user-friendliness is high and costs are low. This is exactly what Legal Desk has managed to create, and I am very much looking forward to collaborating on the further development and expansion with Simon, Anders and the rest of the team”."
2022.5.31,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/zinc-announces-a-new-e32-9-million-fund-to-back-mission-driven-founders-who-are-addressing-the-most-pressing-societal-issues/,"Zinc, a London-based venture builder and early-stage investor, today announced that it has completed the first close at €32.9 million, of a fund targeting a final close of around €38.8 million. The goal is to invest in the huge global wave of entrepreneurs who want to build commercial solutions to our most pressing societal challenges. The Zinc 2 Fund is an early-stage venture capital fund that backs mission-driven talent, pre-team and pre-idea.Each of its venture builder programmes has 70 entrepreneurs all focused on one of Zinc’s four missions: improving mental health, protecting our natural environment, improving the quality of later life, and helping people impacted by automation and globalisation. Zinc and the entrepreneurs share a conviction that each of these missions is a big opportunity for both social impact and commercial success. Since 2017 Zinc has backed over 220 diverse founders who have built more than 60 ventures across the four missions such as Vira Health (menopause support), Tandem (transportation for workers in small cities and towns), Pexxi (personalised contraception pills), Bellevie (better jobs in homecare), Untangle (grief support), Beanbag (support for eating disorders), and more. The new fund will back 500 diverse entrepreneurs to create brand-new ventures from scratch and invest in 100 of the ventures they create. The founders Zinc backed in its most recent venture builder programme are > 50% women, 15% Black, with an average age of 38. The fund has been cornerstoned by the British Business Bank’s Enterprise Capital Funds programme, which supports new and emerging VC fund managers who target the early stage equity gap. Other investors include Big Society Capital, Molten Ventures, Isomer, Dunhill Medical Trust, Atomico, Anthemis Group, family offices, and some of Europe’s most successful tech entrepreneurs and early stage investors such as Taavet Hinrikus from Taaven+Sten, Illka Paannan, Sarah Wood and others. Investors in the fund are backing Zinc to become the best place in the world for mission-driven entrepreneurs to start their new business and to experiment their way to impact on a global scale. This has been Zinc’s vision since it was founded in 2017 by Ella Goldner, Paul Kirby and Saul Klein and backed by its early investors including the London School of Economics. Ella Goldner, co-founder of Zinc, explained: “Rather than waiting for good companies to appear, Zinc helps individuals (before they have a business idea or a team) to build from scratch a new commercially-ambitious company to solve the social challenge that they are most passionate about. Typically, those individuals are 10 to 20 years into their career, but are frustrated that they are not having the social impact they want. Either they are in the commercial world (e.g. product, tech, marketing, sales, entrepreneurs) and frustrated that their commercial skills are not being used to solve the most pressing social issues. Or, they are in the social impact world (e.g. doctors, teachers, researchers, NGO workers) and frustrated that they do not have the same freedom, and pace as businesses to innovate and scale. Zinc brings these groups together to combine social impact and commercial skills.” The individuals chosen by Zinc to build a new business join a cohort of up to 70 people who all share the same mission and access a 12 month programme of support and investment. For example, the most recent programme had 68 individuals who were all passionate about improving the mental health of children and young people. The Zinc programme gives the cohort the opportunity to find a co-founder, access expert support, build a product and win financial investment. Zinc will invest up to €294k in each of the companies created. Paul Kirby, co-founder of Zinc, commented: “Our missions are a call to arms: ‘Who wants to quit their jobs and spend the next decade or more solving this problem?’ Each mission unites people who care deeply about the same unsolved problem, cutting across the traditional silos (by industry, profession and private/public/charity) which get in the way of innovation. The mission-led approach has not only attracted brilliant entrepreneurs, with thousands of people willing to quit their job and join the Zinc programme. It also attracts fantastic experts and partner organisations who are equally passionate about the mission and want to help the entrepreneurs succeed. Each of our programmes has 100 Visiting Fellows and an extensive network of partners”. Over the last five years, Zinc has supported more than 200 founders and with the new fund, it will support another 500 founders. The COVID era has accelerated the wave of mid-career talent that wants more purpose and greater freedom to innovate. Diane Morgan, Zinc’s Director of Talent said: “In a time where less than 5% of VC funding in 2021 went to female founders, and less than 0.5% of venture capital (VC) funding going to Black-led startups, the danger is that the products being built won’t meet the needs or tackle the challenges society faces. That’s why we have built cohorts with more than half of our entrepreneurs being women, the cohort being ethnically diverse, and an average age of 38 years and embracing age diversity with a range from mid-20s to mid-50s. We’re attracting talent from around the world, with over 30 nationalities represented in our entrepreneurs, with many of them relocating to the UK to join Zinc and start their business here.”. The Zinc 2 Fund will back seven of Zinc’s venture builder programmes and invest in 100 of the businesses that are created. The first programme is focused on the mental health of children and young people. The next programme will start in October 2022, with 70 founders all focused on B2B solutions to help transform the industries that have the most impact on our environmental crisis."
2022.5.31,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/amsterdam-based-circular-sharing-startup-peerby-raises-e2-3-for-its-continued-expansion/,"Circular sharing platform Peerby.com, the startup that enables neighbors to borrow and lend household items, has just raised €2.3 million in a funding round led by Toronto-based tech and impact fund Loyal. The Dutch impact investor Shamrock Ventures and existing shareholders, including hundreds of crowdfunders, have also invested in this round. Founded in 2012, Peerby aims to use the fresh capital to increase its impact. The first focus will be to grow in medium-sized Dutch cities. The platform strives to reach the same level of sharing as in home town Amsterdam, where 1 in 4 households is already a member. Furthermore, Peerby is taking the renewed platform international, with Belgium already leading the way and rollouts in other countries planned for late 2022 and 2023. The announcement of the investment follows a period of rapid growth and coincides with the tenth anniversary, hundreds of crowdfunders becoming co-owners and the first profitable month of the platform after launching a revamped model in 2019. Peerby’s objective keeps being to connect neighbors and reduce waste and emissions. The financial success of the revamped platform is due to the introduction of a paid membership for borrowers. Peerby’s revenue grew by 222% in 2021 and 200% in 2020. The rapid growth can be attributed to supporters inviting their neighbors to join Peerby’s digital neighborhood sharing shed, which is now filled with over half a million shared products. 900 crowdfunders, who provided the company with a loan five years ago, were given the opportunity to convert their loan into shares as a result of the investment. A vast majority opted for conversion and 40% percent of them even decided to buy additional shares. Peerby investors believe in both the economic and sustainability potential of the company. Recent research by Milieu Centraal, a Dutch environmental research institute, concludes that consumers can reduce their climate impact by more than 25% by making circular choices, such as sharing and borrowing. Daan Weddepohl, the founder and CEO of Peerby stated: “The support from members, crowdfunders and professional investors confirms that everyone is eager for an alternative to today’s hyperconsumption. We’ve always had social and ecological impact and the challenge was to become financially sustainable. Now that we have achieved profitability, the time is ripe to make neighborhood sharing mainstream.” Loyal VC’s founding partner Kamal Hassan commented:“Peerby, besides being a great impact story, is a testament to the power of persistence. Others have struggled to implement this obvious concept, since it has challenging economics. Daan and his team have accumulated years of customer insights and iterated every aspect of their model to crack their industry’s code. Loyal is delighted to support them in expanding the power of sharing.”"
2022.5.31,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/finding-mentors-and-balancing-hustle-and-mental-health-interview-with-ana-wolsztajn-vc-investor-and-cmo-at-kaya-vc/,"It’s no secret that diversity in VC is not where it needs to be. There is a severe lack of representation across Europe in this space – in terms of gender, race, orientation and identity. Whilst there have been some efforts to improve the outlook, most firms are now reporting data related to gender equality but still more than a third of European VC firms do not have a female partner. Looking into other gaps of representation, the data is extremely limited. There’s one firm that’s aiming to make a change – Included VC. This is an organisation run by the VC community aiming to promote underrepresented profiles in this space through mentorship and hands-on support. This fully-funded nine-month Fellowship comprises masterclasses, mentoring, foundational learning, simulated investment committees, in-person retreats and career coaching. Ana Wolsztajn was involved in the Included VC initiative and is now VC Investor and CMO at KAYA VC, a Prague-based investment firm on the lookout for early-stage startups that want to create lasting change sustainably. We chatted with Ana to find out more about her experiences in VC and how having the right mentor can really make your career flourish. Her story is a fascinating one and she has some wonderful gems of advice – so, grab a seat and enjoy.  You have just taken the lead as VC Investor and CMO at KAYA – firstly, congratulations on the role! It’s wonderful to see more inspiring women reaching these roles. Can you tell us a bit more about your background? What inspired you to enter VC? Thank you, I am really excited about this opportunity. I keep having these moments when I look back and wonder how every experience that seemed unrelated before, fits nicely into my (still developing) skillset of the VC investor. I started my career as a Copywriter before the “Mad Men” TV show made it cool. I worked on top tier brands at DDB and McCann, then later left it for life as an entrepreneur. I saw the passion project come to life, faced challenges of the 2008 financial crisis as a business owner, and learned the hardships and joys of running a business. This “founder episode” led to being headhunted to the international team taking part in the digital revolution at Adidas. There, I had the opportunity to experience being on the client side of things, leading remote teams and working with departments distributed across the world. Since then, I have collaborated with a number of tech venture builders, collab centers, accelerators and big event organizers in a variety of growth, product, marketing, and comms roles in mainland Europe, the UK, Asia, and Australia. Being active in the startup ecosystem, I always enjoyed sharing my experience as a mentor and business strategy advisor. I kept acting as a connector between the wider startup community and the world of venture capital, and media as a freelance tech journalist first, and then during my fellowship with Included VC. Until I joined the dark side 😉 First for a summer at Balderton Capital, and since October 2020 with my fantastic Included VC mentors at KAYA VC. ‍I now see how being – to a point – a jack of all trades and trying out many professional paths, really pays off when you work with startups at different stages of growth and from different cultures. But that’s more of an afterthought – what actually inspired me to enter the VC space was the deep understanding of a startup’s needs. Storytelling training, pitch deck reviews and media boost can only go so far. Oftentimes what the startup really needs to grow is money. As an active venture capital investor, I can help startups scale with the right story, but also with the much-needed resources and funding. Included VC and KAYA are both about collaboration, support, and changing the status quo. Can you speak a bit more to the common vision of these two entities? Ever since I became a fellow of the inaugural cohort of Included VC back in 2019, the fellowship’s mission to change the face of venture capital and to open up this world to more underrepresented communities spoke strongly to my personal beliefs. A VC job is more of a marathon than a sprint (I am sure I’ve heard this from more than one of my fantastic mentors!) so being aligned with the vision of your employer really matters. I am not surprised that KAYA was supportive of the Included fellowship from day one, because the two entities share a lot of values. Getting to know my current colleagues as my mentors first, assured me of their approachability and authenticity. I simply knew that joining the team was the right move because it felt right. We’re now at year three and the Included VC family of fellows and alumni is growing into the hundreds. With many fellows joining VC funds or even raising their own, this vision of changing the VC ecosystem from within becomes ever more realistic. Honestly, being able to share my learnings with new cohorts as I mentor alongside my colleagues and partners of KAYA, is the best outcome I could dream of after my transition to VC. One thing facing many young people, that I would love to hear your thoughts on, is the feeling of an ‘endless hustle’. Working odd-jobs, lots of hours, and with little return. What would be your advice for young people in this situation? Gosh, as much as I would like to take the older and wiser view on this, I must admit that without hustling, I wouldn’t be where I am now. It’s definitely a very subjective view but I believe that some of our ambitious goals may require a lot of time, energy and hard work. You should do whatever you can to realise your dreams and shouldn’t be shamed for trying harder. This is especially true for those trying to keep up with industry peers who may be in a more advantageous position due to their socioeconomic status or stronger representation in the industry. Nevertheless, I do acknowledge that this relentless approach to work could turn into a vicious cycle and seriously impact our physical and mental health, so it’s a delicate balance. Ultimately, it’s a personal choice and whatever path we each choose, we have to live with the consequences. No matter how much of a passion your work is for you (I tend to choose paths that led me to work crazy hours doing things I love!), we do need a healthy balance in our lives. I’m still learning this, and far from being an expert here. But stillness and stopping the daily grind can reframe how you see things and bring a new perspective. For the sake of better results, your health and your personal life, I recommend not giving up on hobbies, skimping on sleep or friends/family interactions. And I cannot stress enough how crucial it is to avoid toxic conditions, and instead, seek out a nurturing environment. Have you had any important mentors in your life that have helped you reach where you are today? If so, what’s the benefit of having such mentors? I’ve been a nerdy bookworm since forever, so my first mentors were from the literary world. I can’t stress enough how much reading opened my view to the world and its countless possibilities. Real-life mentors came later. Especially in VC, I recognise how crucial it is to have someone guide you through this new career. There’s a wealth of experience to be shared around venture capital and finding people willing to impart their knowledge truly accelerated my growth. I absolutely have Included VC to thank for those rockstar mentors – Chris Tottman, Jamie Novoa, Itxaso Del Palacio, and last but not least, KAYA partners with their continuous support, insights and inspiration. What do you see as major trends in the future of European VC? This is a really interesting question. I’m noticing more investors mentioning gender lens investing in their thesis. There’s a new wave of angel syndicates and scout programmes that focus on startups with diverse founders. Hopefully, more funds will understand that diversity can mean an unfair advantage in business and often an already resilient founding team."
2022.5.31,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/05/its-time-for-female-founders-to-rocket-up-sponsored/,"Gender balance in the entrepreneurial ecosystem has been historically poor. The world of business is male-dominated and too often women and those not-identifying as male are cut off from accessing funding and reaching the top level of their career. Male founders still account for the majority of successful international companies. For a venture to succeed on an international scale, startups need to access new markets. Given that women traditionally have less access to the upper echelons of business, expanding into new markets can be made more difficult as they have fewer connections and fewer opportunities. As part of Supernovas, the Rocket-up programme has opened a call for female-led startups to support their access to new European markets. Ten startups will be selected to participate in the activities, which will promote international outreach and sales to the most innovative ventures. The deadline for the call is 19 June 2022. Through initiatives like Rocket-up, Supernovas support ventures to achieve growth by giving founders the vital network and international expansion tools. It’s part of a commitment to help bring about gender balance in the European startup ecosystem. Rocket-up is a 3-month programme that supports women-led startups in accessing a new country or region by connecting them with experts and networking opportunities in the target market. The programme is looking for startups with a product-market-fit, are based in the EU or EU related countries, that add to the Sustainable Development Goals and address challenges related to EIT Urban Mobility, EIT Manufacturing or EIT Food focus areas. What’s included?  Internationalisation squad: Tailored and individual mentoring with three handpicked local experts for advice on the new ecosystem, possible connections, and soft-landing resources. Organised mission: Face-to-face introductions to potential stakeholders of the preferred target city, region or country. Online group events: Four online events with training activities, successful female entrepreneurs as speakers and opportunities for networking and connection with other entrepreneurial women. EIT pan-European network: Access to the EIT network (including European cities, industries partners, and investors) and financial opportunities Visibility: More visibility of the startups through EIT communication channels as an EIT Community supported venture  Through programmes like this, more women and people identifying as female are being empowered to take on major positions and become the future leaders and role models of the future. Sound interesting to you? Apply via AwardsForce – the deadline is June 19th! The programme is equity-free and 100% funded by the European Union. It is held inside Supernovas, a project of EIT Food, EIT Urban Mobility and EIT Manufacturing."
2022.6.1,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/uk-based-florence-raises-e32-6-million-to-revolutionise-social-care-staffing/,"Social care is an area under a lot of stress and workers and providers are finding it increasingly difficult to manage. As a result, across Europe, a social care staffing crisis is becoming uncovered, which has impacts across the entire society. Launched in the UK in 2017 by NHS doctor Charles Armitage and ex-British Army officer Dan Blake in response to the crisis, Florence is using tech to revolutionise social care staffing. The health tech startup has just raised over €32.6 million in new funding. The Series B round was led by Axa Venture Partners with participation from Roo Capital and existing backers SEEK Investments. Dr. Charles Armitage, co-founder explained the vision behind the startup: “We believe everyone should have the care and dignity they deserve. We see this funding as an investment in solving the issues our broken system faces on a daily basis, which disproportionately impact the most vulnerable people in our society.” The tech innovators has developed a free app which can be used to connect nurses with open shifts. It cuts out agency middlemen so shifts are filled directly with the right temporary staff. The app also provides care organisations with the intuitive rota and e-learning tools. So far, 10k e-learners, 90k care professionals and over 2,000 care organisations have signed up to Florence. With 11% of staff in both the NHS and social care permanently leaving the sector in 2021, the need for better ways to keep skilled people in the profession is more urgent than ever. Imran Akram, Axa Venture Partners General Partner, commented: “There is a global shortage of healthcare workers, and staff management is very outdated compared to other industries. Florence is tackling these issues head-on, and we are really impressed with what the team have done to date. Most of all, we’re excited to be part of realising their ambitious plans for care in the future.” After increasing revenue fivefold in 2021-22, and a successful launch in Northern Ireland, Florence now serves more than a quarter of social care in the UK and operates across 99% of the country. Florence will use this funding round to achieve further product innovation and open new markets. With increased digital services a key point of the government’s £500m levy to nurture adult social care talent, Florence’s expansion comes at a crucial time to help the sector grow. Dan Blake, Florence co-founder also said: “Making sure our nurses and care providers are equipped with the knowledge, skills and support needed for their role is essential for providing quality care, and remains at the heart of our mission at Florence.” In our world that is increasingly associated with challenges and crises, impact-driven startups that are on a mission to genuinely improve lives for the better are positive signs to see. Given the pertinency of Florence’s offering, it’ll be exciting to see what’s next for the young team."

With the boom of delivery providers in the last couple of years, it’s a new culinary phenomenon that has changed many of our eating habits. However, for those outside the city centre, in the suburbs, and beyond, it’s still a luxury. Founded in 2021 by Ville Leppälä and Ville Lehto, Huuva wants to make great food available everywhere. The Helsinki-based startup has just picked up €4.9 million in a fresh round led by General Catalyst. The round was also joined by Lifeline Ventures, known for its early investment in companies like Wolt and Supercell, as well as participation from a number of angel investors including Laurel Bowden and Ilkka Paananen. Huuva builds delivery-focused restaurant cohorts around cities and suburbs, focusing on bringing new quality restaurant options to yet unserved neighbourhoods. Since September 2021, Huuva has opened six kitchens around the greater Helsinki area. Ville Leppälä, the co-founder and CEO of Huuva, explained: “Restaurant offerings outside city centres are close to non-existent. We’re on a mission to revolutionize the restaurant offering in underserved neighbourhoods. We believe that the trendiest, most popular restaurants shouldn’t be the privilege of city centres or certain hot spots – and that the neighbourhoods in the city outskirts should have other high-quality options than the average multinational restaurant chains”. Each of Huuva’s kitchens gathers 3-6 well-known restaurant brands under one roof, enabling consumers to order their favourite dishes from multiple brands in one delivery. Ville added: “Before setting up a new Huuva kitchen we analyze the local trends and current restaurant selection to bring the most fitting restaurants for the people. It’s also important for us to consider delivery operations and put the neighbourhood’s comfort first.” So, not only does the startup provide a much-demanded service, but they do so with cultural sensitivity and community awareness. Contrary to other delivery-only kitchens in the market, Huuva’s neighbourhoods-first approach places its restaurant cohorts around city perimeters, bringing much-awaited new restaurant options for people outside of the busy city centres. Ville continued: “Our vision is to enable local entrepreneur-driven restaurant brands to scale their business without the limitation of country or city borders – or time – through Huuva’s locations around Europe. The future of restaurants will be driven through platforms like Huuva.” Huuva has already partnered with several top restaurant brands in Finland, such as Via Tribunali, Green Hippo and Pupu. With the new funding, Huuva is looking to ramp up its expansion in Central Europe, recruit +100 new team members with a heavy focus on business and operations talent and better serve the market with its unique neighbourhoods-first focus. Adam Valkin, Managing Director at General Catalyst said: “Since their launch in September 2021, Huuva has made impressive progress. Their unique approach in Europe has significantly improved the food selection for the end customer in a number of neighbourhoods, while making food delivery more profitable for restaurants.  At the same time, couriers get to pick up from delivery optimized locations minimizing delivery times.” Timo Ahopelto, Founding Partner at Lifeline Ventures added: “Huuva is a prime showcase of an ambitious, fast-moving startup with a distinctive offering in an exciting new market. Huuva is able to cater to all stakeholders, from restaurant entrepreneurs to food-loving end-customers and delivery operators – a unique position to be in. We are excited to continue to be a part of Huuva’s growth journey.”"

From the Nordics to the Mediterranean, more and more of us are now zooming around on environmentally friendly, electricity-fuelled forms of transport, bikes and scooters being two of the more popular and accessible choices. Aiming to bring the emobility revolution to everyone, Paris-based Upway runs a platform for the second-hand purchase, reconditioning and resale of electric bikes. The startup, founded in 2021, has just geared up its mission to become Europe’s leading provider with a fresh capital raise of over €23 million. The funding was led by Exor Seeds and Sequoia Capital with participation from Origins as well as existing investors Global Founders Capital, and key business angels in the mobility sector such as Henri Moissinac, CEO and co-founder of Dott and Moving Capital. It follows a €5 million raise in November 2021. Toussaint Wattinne, CEO and co-founder of Upway: “By backing Upway, our investors are confirming that the future of mobility is electric, sustainable and affordable. It demonstrates that our offer meets an increasingly strong demand from consumers who want to travel at a lower cost while limiting their carbon footprint. Upway’s mission is to accelerate the adoption of electric mobility at a time of massive awareness of environmental issues”. The refurbished electric mobility market is on the rise, boosted by the expansion of bike lanes, restrictions on car traffic in cities, increased pressure on electronic waste and the booming circular economy. The electric bike market recorded a 28% increase in 2021 in France, representing nearly 60% of sales revenue in the total bike market (€1.3 billion). Today, nearly one in four bicycles sold in France is an electric bike – so there is huge market potential here. However, there are some sticking points – namely, high prices (€2,000 on average), a supply shortage leading to delivery delays (6-8 months) and, finally, concerns about the condition of the battery in second-hand models. This is what Upway founders, Toussaint Wattinne and Stéphane Ficaja wanted to tackle. The Parisian startup is Europe’s pioneering platform dedicated to the reconditioning and resale of electric bikes. The company is helping to fuel a new eco-friendly way to travel across Europe though offering electric bikes by prestigious brands, refurbished in France by professional mechanics on 20 different checkpoints, sold up to 60% cheaper than first-hand bikes, and delivered to the client’s home in just a few days, and, covered by a one-year warranty. Since the start of the year, Upway has grown its sales of electric bikes by 600%, doubled the size of its team and commenced its European expansion by launching in Belgium in March. However, they are just getting started and, with this new funding plan to launch in Germany, the Netherlands and the United States by the end of 2022. Blaise Matuidi, co-founder Origins Fund, said: “Investing in Upway was an obvious choice – sustainable mobility has become a priority. Making it accessible to as many people as possible contributes to the promotion of physical activity and the preservation of our environment. Supporting Upway in their global expansion has a particular significance for Origins’ athletes.” Toussaint Wattinne added: “Having opened in Belgium with 500 refurbished e-bikes available for resale, we’ve had an amazing response as many Belgians care deeply about eco-responsibility. This rapid adoption is driving us to continue our expansion through Europe, and even across the Atlantic where we are seeing a tremendous increase in sales of e-bikes so much so that the US could be well on their way to catching up with Europe, which has been ahead of the curve.”"
2022.6.1,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/parisian-investment-firm-alven-announces-new-e350-million-fund-to-boost-european-entrepreneurs/,"There’s been a lot of chatter in the European VC space over recent weeks. And now, adding to the conversation, Paris-based Alven has just announced its sixth generation fund. The initial target was €300 million, but Fund VI has closed at a hard cap of €350 million – making it the largest early-stage fund raised in France. Alven VI secured commitments from a wide range of high-quality European, North American and other global institutions, and all investors in the prior fund are reinvesting. Known for its eye for making unicorn investments, Alven has been a part of the success stories of Qonto, Dataiku, Algolia, Stripe and Ankorstore, and now has €2 billion in assets under management. Launched in 2000, Alven is an early-stage fund centred in Paris but with a global reach. The firm recently opened a new London office and has about 160 European teams backed across Europe and the US. The French investors have extensive experience backing and supporting exceptional founders at the earliest stages, writing cheques to kickstart growth ranging from €100k to €15 million, with substantial reserves for follow on investments. Guillaume Aubin and Charles Letourneur, co-founders of Alven, said: “We pride ourselves in building long term relationships with entrepreneurs, and this also applies to investors in Alven. Not only our existing LPs have continually invested in us, but we’ve also welcomed a number of new investors that want to be part of the French Tech success story”. Alongside their unicorn success and impressive portfolio, the company has also realized more than 70 exits, including the more recent sale of Sqreen to Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG), Cardiologs to Philips (NYSE: PHG) and Frichti to Gorillas. Beyond the money, Alven supports portfolio companies with its internal People Operations team, providing founders with advisory, access to proprietary talent pools, local industry benchmarks, content and processes to enable them to execute and scale even faster. The team also recently launched Operation3, the first talent program dedicated to identifying and training tomorrow’s best web3 operators as well as a number of initiatives to foster and nurture a pool of female executives to promote diversity within its portfolio executive committees. Given the very competitive nature of the European talent market, this deeply-rooted positioning has been a key success factor for Alven and has made it a very attractive platform for founders and US VCs to partner with, as evidenced by the high number of co-lead investments with top tier US funds. The investment company promotes a multi-sector specialist approach, where each investor should bring domain expertise and relationships to the table. Therefore, Alven will continue to build on its successes in fintech, marketplaces, enterprise software, social & entertainment. There will also be an emphasis on new growth areas in crypto (Alven recently invested in Kaiko, a market data provider for digital assets), but also other areas in developer and data tooling as well as climate tech, exemplified by the new fund’s recent investments in Mindee (a document parsing tool for developers), MyTraffic (physical location data analytics), Carbonfact (a carbon footprint API) and Stoik (data-driven cyber insurance). A portion of this new fund will be deployed across Europe, as well as in European founders in the US in sectors where the firm has built deep expertise."

According to Dr Anna Tórz, the leading coordinator of the Scale-up Champions project and International Cooperation Officer at Poznan Science and Technology Park, international programmes tailored to the development of deep-tech startups have a huge role to play. Connected innovation systems “Over the past 2 and a half years, the Scale-up Champions project has implemented different programmes helping boost innovation and startup acceleration. The Startup-corporate Collaboration programme, The Investment Readiness programme, Startup Online Incubation and Market Discovery Tours”, said Dr Anna Tórz. All of these projects focused on supporting deep-tech startups to enter new markets in the growing innovation hubs of Denmark, Spain, Poland, Estonia, and Lithuania. Collaboration between markets is a key to the success of these programmes. The Scale-up Champions team have now organised more than 500 small and big events for about 375 deep-tech startups. More than 300 investors and 47 corporations from different countries joined the international project and advised innovators on how to boost their business plan, create a pitch deck, where to look for new partners and much more. Dr. Anna Tórz, added: “Startups were engaged in improving their networking skills and having mentoring support on startup’s value proposition issues. They needed a road map when they were going to expand to different markets.”  Kadri Tammai Tehnopol Startup Incubator Manager, coordinating the Online Incubation and Market Discovery Tours, highlighted how during these events, knowledge sharing in terms of local markets, like insights, suggestions, validations, and preparation can help the companies to facilitate their growth more easily with low risk and low cost. Kadri said: “If you know the market, probably you will not make the same mistakes that other competitors already did. Also, local partners can support building connections by opening their network of partners around the world, which will help to find potential future customers and build the trust that can ease your way into the new market.” There were 15 different Open Calls to participate in the different Scale-up Champions programmes and scaling-support activities, and all deep-startups could choose one or several of them. Investments in the R&D Field One of the programmes launched online was the Investment Readiness programme for those eager to e-meet international investors and have individual consultations with mentors and experts on how to improve business plans and the pitch deck.  Through Scale-up Champions and similar projects, Unsinkable Robotics has been able to establish new partnerships within the Estonian and Norwegian business and maritime sectors. The team was advised by Danish maritime robotics specialist Resen Waves. According to Timmu Tollimägi, CEO of the startup, they expected to find technology partners in the destination country, in machine vision with the aim of exploring if they could find maritime partners with valuable experience. Timmu said: “During the project, we raised a pre-seed investment of €200k. At the moment we have 3 pilots going on in Norway. Through strategic investors, it is easier to reach new clients as they are well connected within the industry”. Juozas Baltušnikas, Co-founder of Science Architect, added: “During the tour in Estonia, I managed to introduce our technology to many investors. What especially helped is the Brella app, where I managed to precisely select the most suited investors and schedule meetings with them. With many of them, I will have follow-up calls. The Latitude59 event and the Brella app. together are game-changers”. Juozas also added that Denmark is a great place to find deep-tech partners – based on the culture and personality of the Danes, as well as the scientific and deep-tech expertise available in the country.  Support for Better Knowledge In 2022, Online Market Discovery Tours was released to support startups in the scaling process. Through it, regional congresses and expos tripled their chances to make impactful contacts. Founders were able to discover new materials for their product upgrades, legal frameworks to locate the business and funding options not previously considered. Dimitri Ionesco, Founder of LightMirror participated in several Market Discovery missions organised by Scale-up Champions project. During the pandemic, he moved to Lithuania to implement more R&D and improve the prototype of panels that enlighten the public buildings and improve their energy efficiency. Here, he was able to get involved in the Scale-up Champions Webinars and find out about the programmes available for deep-tech startups. For him, such programmes for startups and incubation activities are a great push, especially for first-time founders. He said: “In this programme, I made the first contacts in the Polish startup ecosystem. Our main clients are the infrastructure managers of the public hospitals. Usually, these buildings were built 50-60 years ago. According to the long-term renovation strategy of the Polish public buildings of 2022, Poland’s hospital and healthcare buildings are among the most energy-consuming facilities in the country. The average is 611kWh/m², while the country’s current requirements for new healthcare building construction are 110kWh/m². These numbers show the urge to change the situation.” Dimitri affirms that for an early-stage startup, coming to a new country and participating in startup events is crucial to make the first contact. It’s a chance to meet many people in a short time – and every person is an opportunity for synergy, potential investment or can be a new client. Kadri Tammai adds that during the on-site Market Discovery Tour, the companies received a huge amount of knowledge of new markets like local startup ecosystem overview, deep-tech sector development goals, local business culture peculiarities, insights in venture capital investments, collaboration opportunities with corporates/universities and so on – which will help to get the better view of the market fit. Meetings with Global Corporations Carmen Adán, Scale-up Champions Startup-corporate Collaboration program coordinator, finds that one of the most valuable parts of the project is that it allows corporations to scout R&D innovation and collaboration activities with startups. In fact, 47 well known global corporations, including the likes of Volkswagen, Pfizer, and Teltonika joined the programme. Carmen said: “We were matching the applied startups with corporates’ challenges. In total there were 108 challenges in the categories Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, FinTech, MedTech, GreenTech, Retail, Biotech. Corporates had to pitch their main challenges and were reverse-pitched by startups with their unique solutions for chosen categories.” Dr. Anna Tórz added: “Regional startup hubs and deep-tech incubators joined us as community partners. It has led to fruitful collaboration initiatives – consultation opportunities for startups, Demo Day Investors panels and even gave us the courage to apply for IASP Inspiring Solutions Awards”.  Scale-up Champions is an initiative that aims to scale-up innovative businesses across the EU and help startups to achieve market success. Following the support of the European Commission, Scale-up Champions aims to connect different European deep-tech startup ecosystems and support cross-border activities to standardise the growth routes in Europe. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 871877"
2022.6.2,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/the-six-steps-to-make-your-startup-a-global-success-sponsored/,"Thinking about taking your startup to the global market? Want to reach an international audience? It’s a natural step for many startups and SMBs, but, global business expansion is no easy task! Navigating cultural subtleties and communication practices in a time- and cost-efficient way poses a unique set of hurdles to jump over and loops to climb through. This is where localization comes to the rescue. Localization is much more than simple translation and it is critical to your startup’s journey into the international marketplace. But what does an effective and resource-efficient localization strategy look like? Here, we break down the localization process into six easy steps. Step 1: Devise a market strategy Your product or service may not be the right fit for every market. It might not resonate with locals, or a competitor may have already filled the gap. Researching potential markets is integral to global expansion that delivers ROI. So, start broad.  Which countries have the highest demand for your solution? If we are talking about a software solution, is your software local – in other words, does it require geographical data to execute core functionalities? Is it impacted by government regulations and compliance? Answering these bigger-picture questions will help you narrow down your potential market, but you can dig further. Where are your current website visitors from? If international visitors are browsing your site but not making purchases, it’s time to create a localized website for that region. Using tools like Google Analytics, you can see where your web users are located and which languages they browse in. Are the people that fall into your prospective international market receptive to online marketing? How do they make buying decisions? Do they have any niche pain points that your product or service can resolve? If your product’s target market is relatively broad or overwhelmingly large, you might like to consider factors like purchasing power. How much do individuals or companies have to spend on solutions like yours?  Research your competition Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. It’s a truism that has helped many businesses level up their reach and thrive in new markets, and it’s something you should consider when translating your content. Start by visiting your competitors’ websites. What languages have they translated their software or webpages into? You can try to reach the same audiences your competitor is targeting, or you can look for untapped markets and find gaps that you can fill. If you sell a product or a service that simply isn’t available in New Zealand, for example, your business may benefit from filling that gap. Don’t forget to research international competition, too. If you run a US-based company looking to expand into Germany, wrap your head around German businesses serving your target market. To sum up, when selecting the right market, consider its size, key players, and any legal rules and regulations impacting your industry. Assess the competition. Step 2: Build a localization strategy and prioritize languages So, you’ve decided on the target markets and done so with plenty of considered research. Next step is building a localization strategy that prioritizes languages. Startups typically work with restricted budgets, meaning the language selection process must be fine-tuned and backed by data. Of course, if the region you plan to target shares the one native language, the process will be simple. However, if you want to launch across Europe, for example, you’ll need to weigh the pros and cons of the continent’s 24 official languages. The cost of translation will depend on several factors, including:  The amount of content you want to translate The source language The target language The format of your content The partner you work with  If you only have the budget to translate your content into one language and it’s not already available in English, consider making English your number one priority. English literacy is high even in non-English speaking countries. The most-used languages Numbers might play a role in your translation and localization strategies. First, you can look at the most-used languages on the internet, although this will unlikely be the most decisive factor. The most commonly used languages on the internet currently are:  English (63.1%) Russian (6.2%) Turkish (3.7%) Spanish (3.6%) Persian (3.3%)  English is a clear winner, and as we mentioned, should likely be a top priority for your content. The following four most-used languages may or may not cater to your target market. Instead, you might gain more from considering core markets and their respective languages. Some established and up-and-coming markets’ languages include: English, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Portuguese and Italian. Choose languages your target markets speak Ultimately, which languages you decide to translate your software depends on which languages your target markets speak. Let your audience guide you toward the right decision, using data where possible to confirm your assumptions and forecast your return on investment. Step 3: Define your global content strategy At this stage, you are ready to prioritize the content that needs to be localized. To start, evaluate the types of content your startup uses. It might help to consider the following categories:  Branding UI Marketing material Website content Support documentation Blog articles Internal and external communications  From there, you can decide which types of content need to be localized first and which can wait until post-launch. If you have the breathing room, it’s a good idea to localize every touchpoint between your brand and its audience, as this end-to-end approach limits the risk of poor customer experience. Also, keep in mind that some content is required under the law – you have no choice but to localize this before go-to-market. Consider the visuals Localization goes far beyond text. Make sure to also update graphics and photos to reflect the audience you’re targeting. Use photos of local models to showcase your products or services. If your site contains animations or videos, do more than add captions or a voice-over. Consider re-shooting the videos with local actors, employees, or clients. Step 4: Localize your content with a trusted partner Depending on the scope and scale of your startup, localization can be a significant undertaking with many moving parts. Avoid doing it alone. Instead, enlist the help of an experienced localization partner with proven expertise in the market you are targeting. Your partner will oversee research, take care of content organization, and translate and localize the required content ready for your new audience. Along the way, tracking milestones can help you feel prepared when it comes time to implement the localized content. Team work makes the dream work, remember. Step 5: Define and monitor your KPIs Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are critical metrics you can use to evaluate whether your localization and global expansion efforts delivered a worthwhile return. Commonly used KPIs include the following:  Number of new customers Your website or app’s conversion rate The volume of organic traffic Percentage of your customers from the new market Your startup’s market share in the new region  It will take time for the complete picture of your success to be revealed, but you can tweak your approach and hopefully improve your results by keeping your finger on the pulse. Step 6: Evaluate your global expansion success Finally, evaluate your KPIs and calculate your ROI. Looking at the result, consider your strategy – is there anything you would have done differently? What worked and what didn’t? Next time you expand into a new market, how will you approach localization? Will you invest more into updating your imagery or recording new, localized video content? Or did your existing photographs and dubbed videos suffice? The more you can learn from your past, the more empowered you become to shape your future and succeed as a global business. Key takeaway? Don’t do it alone. A global expansion can seem overwhelming. But if you work with a team of localization experts familiar with the nuances of language and culture in your target country, the process can be quick and stress-free.

Jet-setting Europeans are itching to take to the skies again and it’s showing. Within this context, tech innovation in the travel industry had also been taking off and now, booking a holiday is more seamless, simple and stress-free than ever before. From BNPL options to integrated booking systems, travellers can book a holiday all at the click of a button (well, almost one click). Joining the traveltech innovation boom, German startup Lambus, is offering an all-in-one travel platform and the team has just secured €800k in seed funding. The funding was led by NBank Capital and ennea Invest, as well as other strategic business angels. Industry leaders such as former Managing Director Europe of Kayak, Jan Valentin and founder of V-Tours, Tobias Wolfshohl also pledged to help the company with its strategic direction and the development of new partnerships, in addition to supporting it with fresh capital. Other backers include Thomas Knaack, Thomas Hanke, Dr. Geoffery Weisner, JAC Ventures and Third Level Ventures. Hans Knöchel, Co-Founder and CEO of Lambus commented: “The Corona pandemic has been a major challenge for the entire travel industry. We are currently seeing a massive increase in booking volume and user engagement in general, which verifies the strength and need for our product. This is a testament to the entire team that the work of the last two years of the Pandemic is now paying off – having over 200.000 unique users on the platform already. The closing of the funding round and the investors’ confidence in our product and business model is a nice confirmation of this work.” Founded in Osnabrück, Germany, in 2019, Lambus is a collaborative platform that consolidates and digitizes various aspects of travel planning and execution (waypoints, travel costs, booking documents and Seite 2/2 much more) in one central location. It’s helping travel enthusiasts who want to manage and story all their trips centrally and digitally. The team was actually a finalist in lst year’s FutureTravel Summit Pitch Competition – which will be happening again this year. The fresh capital will be used to take the next steps to further turn the vision of digitizing the entire travel process from planning to execution and follow-up into reality. The funding will further drive the monetization and internationalization of the platform to provide a consistent, stress-free and digital travel experience for travellers worldwide."

2022.6.7,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/paris-based-defacto-lands-e15-million-to-support-sme-growth-with-its-b2b-lending-platform/,"Amidst heightened anxiety surrounding rising costs, rising interest rates and those repayments of pandemic loans, there are some concerns in the SME space at the moment. However, instead of getting bogged down in pessimism, it’s important to highlight that there are still elements of growth, and new innovations coming about to facilitate financial resilience. One of them being the fintech space. Aiming to support SME growth across Europe through instant and embedded B2B lending, Parisian startup Defacto has just scored €15 million in fresh funding. The round was led by Northzone with participation from existing investors, Headline and GFC. Founded in June 2021 by Jordane Giuly, Defacto provides loans and credit to small companies through an API-based product. It enables third parties such as marketplaces, ecommerce platforms and others to embed its products directly in their own products, integrating seamlessly. With a tech-first approach, the French startup is providing access to working capital to SMEs – a segment underserved by traditional actors and one that is crucial to maintaining financial growth and optimism in today’s climate. Morgan O’Hana, co-founder, explained: “Cash flow and access to liquidity are once again reasons for concern due to inflation, repayment of state covid loan and rising interest rates. Traditional banking caters less to SMEs and processes are too slow. An EY study estimates that in France alone, over 40.000 businesses will fail. It was 28.000 in 2021. We are building a product for builders, not bankers. Access to capital should be fair and instant. Banks rely on data that is at least 18 months old and then take 4 months or longer to process loan applications. We move in real-time.” Already since its launch in France, the young company has built partnerships with over 15 leading B2B marketplaces, fintech companies and ecommerce businesses – distributing over €30 million in short term loans. Not only is the product pertinent in this financial environment, but it also reflects the constantly accelerating digitalisation of the SME space. B2B transactions have moved online through marketplaces which confirms the embedded lending opportunity. With Defacto fintech’s can offer invoice financing to their customer base, B2B marketplaces can finance invoices and offer BNPL to buyers, and B2C ecommerce companies can better fund their inventories. Defacto’s co-founder and CTO Marc-Henri Gires, commented: “Businesses are interacting more and more with digital platforms. Those interactions generate a large amount of data in real-time, which Defacto is leveraging to redefine how underwriting should be done. Banking institutions will never have the right information systems to process this flow of alternative data, to reach real-time and tailored lending offers.” The team of 13 based in Paris are now looking forward to continuing to grow with this new funding boost. Defacto will now roll out its solution to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain – helping SMEs across Europe to scale. Jonathan Userovici, a Partner at Headline, added: “Finance needs to shift towards real-time data and processes. Small and medium businesses make for 99% of all European businesses. Yet traditional banking is increasingly shy in supporting them. Defacto’s Capital by API provides entrepreneurs with forms of credit that not only scale with their needs but are also more fair and transparent. It’s an engine for growth. I have rarely met a team so customer-focused and achieving so much in one short year.”"
2022.6.7,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/oslo-based-findable-secures-e2-million-to-make-building-documentation-digital/,"Building documentation might not have the most exciting reputation. It’s generally associated with paperwork and logistics, but, it’s something that is incredibly important. To bring old-fashioned building documentation processes into the 21st Century, Oslo-based startup Findable is using AI to organise and digitise the documents – making buildings and their management simpler and easier. The startup, launched in 2020, has just secured €2 million for its automaton AI platform from KOMPAS, with participation from Construct Venture and Malling & Co Venture. Building documentation can be described as the instruction manual of a building. The huge volumes of information stored in these documents relate to anything from the construction history and contractor details to maintenance information on HVAC units, pipes, electricals and fire safety. They are, therefore, incredibly important. Storing this documentation safely and organising it in an easily accessible way is necessary to ensure routine facility management, inspection and certification processes. Poorly organised documentation results in additional costs for building owners by as much as €2 per square metre every year, while the physical storage of documents can frequently result in loss or damage. Fredrik Halmøy Wisløff, CEO at Findable explained: “Building documentation, its organisation and storage, is quite frankly a tedious task. Even today it’s still a largely manual process involving stacks of paper and piles of ring binders. Similar to the software that automatically sorts photo albums using face recognition, our technology quickly identifies the key data and makes it easier for relevant parties to access the information that matters. Digitising and automating building documentation is the only way to streamline this laborious but critical aspect of building management.” Findable digitises building documentation, using AI to automatically categorise documents and allows users to locate specific information via a search function. The software is able to analyse headlines, pictures and drawings, and quickly conclude what the document shows and how it should be organised. It means that documents are more secure, complete and accessible. As a result, time is saved enabling construction companies and facility managers to streamline the process of inspections and certifications. The startup’s tech comes at a time when sectors are finding themselves with the necessity to digitise to keep up with the demands of the modern world. It also reflects a growing need for improved documentation with stricter building controls coming into force. In the UK for example this is starting to take shape through the ongoing Grenfell Tower Inquiry which has recommended new laws in their Phase 1 Report to make building documentation more accessible. The new capital injection will be used by the Norwegian team to scale the platform further and grow its customer base as the team plans for international expansion. Sebastian Peck, Partner at KOMPAS added: “The facilities management sector in Europe is a massive market undergoing its own digital transformation. The construction industry, property developers and facility managers all require digital solutions to meet complex regulatory and sustainability requirements. Findable’s solution provides easy access to the right building documentation, supporting workflow automation and thereby removing a major bottleneck. We are really excited to back the terrific team at Findable.”"
2022.6.7,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/french-startup-cleverconnect-merges-with-talentry-to-lead-talent-acquisition-in-europe/,"Across Europe, there has been a notable problem in the workforce across markets – a skills shortage. Not only does this have an impact on workplaces and growth, but also puts increasing strain on recruitment and HR professionals. Aiming to become the European leader of talent acquisition solutions, CleverConnect and Talentry have just announced they will be joining forces to arm companies with the recruitment and HRtech tools they need. Together, the French and German companies want to counteract the current unprecedented shortage of skilled workers – by using the most efficient and advanced technologies to help recruiters on a daily basis and offer fulfilling candidate experiences. Founded in Paris in 2010, CleverConnect is helping over 2,500 companies across Europe to rethink their recruitment strategy. The HRtech startup, which recently raised €30 million, has developed an innovative SaaS solution for time-shifted video interviews, intelligent career pages with AI, and matching technology for resumes. Potential talents can be addressed and converted into applicants in an efficient and modern way. Talentry, which was founded in Munich in 2013, is on a mission to connect people with the organizations that they love. The team pioneered a digital employee referral programme and is putting a personal touch at the heart of its recruitment strategy. With its cloud-based talent relationship platform, Talentry accompanies customers in every phase of the application process in order to efficiently find the best talents across all available channels and retain them in the long term. While Europe is one of the most affected markets in terms of skills shortages, HR professionals are increasingly facing a lack of quality applications and rising international competition. As a result, investments in talent management, employer branding, and high-quality job postings, as well as tools that can convert applicants into qualified talent, are becoming the focus of HR spending. Louis Coulon, co-founder of CleverConnect, explained: “Today, no organization can afford to neglect candidate experience and forgo recruitment transformation. We’ve been impressed by Talentry’s culture, values and innovative products and even more by the complementarity with ours. With this merger, we are fully committed to develop an integrated platform that offers a holistic approach to talent acquisition, from attraction to retention. I am very pleased to welcome the wonderful team members of Talentry and am convinced that together we can become a European-born Global leader.” Through this new partnership, CleverConnect will become a 270-employee team with strong roots in both France and Germany – two of the powerhouses of the continent. It will enable CleverConnect to optimally and holistically support organizations in transforming their recruitment processes to attract newly qualified candidates, engage them in sustainable relationships and reveal their skills and potential, as well as offer candidates a fulfilling experience. Marko Vujasinovic, co-founder & CEO of CleverConnect, added: “Europe has been facing skills shortage for many years now, and is complex to address for recruiting teams because of each country’s specificities and constraints. This makes it the most advanced market in terms of recruitment strategy and HR care. That is why we believe a European specialist like Cleverconnect, with solid German and French roots, has all the assets to be a Global champion of our category. And history shows that in many industries Franco-German companies have become worldwide leaders.” In addition, renowned investors of Talentry like Carsten Thoma, Bastian Nominacher and Alex Rinke will join CleverConnect’s investors. Carl Hoffmann, founder and CEO of Talentry GmbH joins CleverConnect as a co-founder immediately. Carl Hoffmann, founder & CEO Talentry GmbH, said: “CleverConnect and Talentry not only share a deep expertise in HR and recruiting, we also share the same company values and strive for one mission: provide fulfilling job opportunities for everyone. The skills shortage has reached enormous proportions and will continue to plague companies around the world. So it is only logical that we join forces and face this challenge together with CleverConnect to support our customers in the best possible way. I am therefore very much looking forward to the German-French cooperation at eye level and to an exciting time full of ideas, further development and growth.”"

With tech, athletes can train better, smarter and harder. It means athletes – amateurs and pros alike – can reach new goals and milestones and continue smashing those personal (and world) records. Founded in London in 2016, Let’s Do This is on a mission to inspire people across the world to come together to experience moments that make them feel alive. It’s about building a community based on supportive sport and athleticism. The platform makes it easy for people to find, book and prepare for the best running, triathlon, cycling and obstacle experiences around the world. It brings together in one place thousands of different sporting events including top flagship events like Hackney Moves, The Great North Run and the Oxford Half. With already more than 5 million active users, the startup has attracted some star-quality attention – including the world-famous inspirational athletes, Serena Williams and Usain Bolt. This latest fundraise saw Craft Ventures and Headline join as lead investors, supported by further funds from existing investors EQT, NFX and Y Combinator, as well as newcomer Morpheus Ventures. These join the company’s existing angel investors from previous rounds including Serena Williams, Usain Bolt and Paula Radcliffe, and founder of Gmail Paul Buchheit, as well as Ian Hogarth, founder of Songkick. Alex Rose, co-founder and COO of Let’s Do This, said: “We are living in a world where we spend more time than ever with our heads buried in our phones. The growing influence of social media and the Metaverse is a depressing extension of this, and the effect on our health and wellbeing cannot be ignored. We want to be the online platform that helps people get offline – so they can live life to the full, doing things that make them happy.” The fresh funding will be used to enhance the website and app experience for searching and booking events. The company will also be building out the social features of the Let’s Do This app, enabling users to follow each other, discover new events based on their network, and share training progress – a major factor in participant motivation. Using online formats to gather people together in the real world. This is in addition to plans to grow from 85 to 150 employees by the end of the year. The company will also be continuing its US expansion with the addition of a new US HQ in Boulder, Colorado. Sam Browne, co-founder and CEO of Let’s Do This, added: “The global sports endurance market is worth an estimated $18bn and, with face-to-face events finally a possibility again after a long hiatus, we know this is only set to grow. As a business, not only are we passionate about sports and live events, we know what it takes to make them a true success, which is why so many organisers already trust us to grow their events. Excitingly, sport is just the beginning for Let’s Do This too. Thanks to the funding and support from our investors, we plan to extend into further verticals in the live events and experiences space – continuing on our mission to bring people together through momentous experiences.” Serena Williams, angel investor in Let’s Do This, said: “I love sport and have seen first-hand the positive impact it can have on people’s lives. But, many people are often held back from discovering sport and the benefits it can bring them. Let’s Do This breaks down this barrier by allowing people to discover new ways of keeping fit, encouraging them to push themselves and providing a sense of community and camaraderie in the process, irrespective of fitness levels. This is a mission that I am proud of – bringing more people together through the power of sport.”"
2022.6.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/nippy-groceries-crowdfunding-campaign-to-revolutionise-the-grocery-experience-picks-up-speed/,"The grocery experience has changed a lot over the past couple of years. Going to the grocery store used to be a standard weekly habit – filling the basket with all the essentials for the week ahead. Kids trying to sneakily throw treats and goodies in the basket without their parents noticing, penny-pinchers scouring the aisles for new deals – just some of the things one could see in their local market. Then, came the era of online shopping and click & collect. It surged in popularity giving our busy lives one less thing to have on the to-do list. Now, we are firmly in the era of quick commerce and on-demand services. And grocery is no different. Whilst ordering food and shopping online isn’t new, during the pandemic it became the norm and most Europeans saw the benefits in this new approach. On a mission to completely reshape the online and offline grocery retail space through an omnichannel approach, UK-based Nippy Groceries are growing fast. Launched in 2021, the startup is offering an innovative approach to commerce, delivering groceries and food in 30 minutes 24/7 – without the premium price tag. Led by the team behind Grocemania, Nippy operates with digital stores and physical stores, via its app, and via multiple aggregators such as UberEats, Deliveroo, Grocemania, JustEat and Foodhub. It means that demand can always be kept up with and consumers can get access to groceries in the way that works best for them. Askar Bulegenov commented: “We’ve been in the grocery industry for the past 6 years pioneering on-demand deliveries with Grocemania. And we know from experience, that subsidizing the growth and customer acquisition with discounts is not always the best idea and recent news from Getir, Gorillas, Jiffy and GoPuff prove us right. That’s why we came up with this unique approach and our own POS system to go for all possible channels in 2022 and grow each site organically without the need for millions spent on marketing and discounts, while also providing customers with best prices and service on all platforms.” The company has built its own POS technology, which allows the system to check SKU availability and snooze them across all channels and even partner marketplaces with a live API integration. This is a revolution in the whole retail industry – and it’s been called ‘Digi Stores’. With this approach, Nippy is challenging the status quo of q-commerce and bringing new possibilities for businesses to grow a truly sustainable and profitable retail network. Currently, the grocery market disruptors are crowdfunding via Seedrs with a target of €170k – and they’re picking up the pace! The plan is to use crowdfunding to build 4 more stores in the UK and scale the pioneering omnichannel grocery option. So far the young startup already has over €100k of revenue without spending on ads or discounts and has counted more than 6k deliveries!"
2022.6.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/london-based-felix-capital-announces-over-e562-million-of-new-funding-to-fuel-emergence-of-digital-and-sustainable-lifestyles/,"Today, Felix Capital has just announced new fundraising of over €562 million – the 4th since the VC firm’s 2015 launch and exceeding the initial target. The fund doubles Felix’s total committed capital to €1.2 billion – showing strength in their VC approach. Based in London, Felix operates at the intersection of tech and creativity, focusing on innovations that enable digital lifestyles. The aim is to be the number one partner for entrepreneurs with groundbreaking ideas and help them build trusted brands that push the world forward. Across personal and professional lives, there is no doubt that life has gone digital. We use digital tech to travel, to order groceries, to connect with colleagues, and even to keep ourselves healthy. While the pandemic may have accelerated this, investments and a belief in young innovation have also generated this new wave of lifestyle. Felix has certainly been one of the firms behind the transformation of the customer journey, investing in enabling technologies. The firm invests within every key aspect of people’s personal lives (including food, shopping, health, wellness, personal finance, entertainment, communication, or gaming), and increasingly around the transformation of their professional lives, with new software tools addressing the modern workforce’s needs. Frederic Court, Felix’s Founder & Managing Partner, said: “Felix was established with the vision that the rapid transformation of consumers’ behaviour represented a massive opportunity and needed focus. Since then, we have built a portfolio in line with that strategy, backing emerging and culturally relevant consumer brands, as well as related enabling technologies that support them. We are proud of the growing community of founders who have trusted us, as we expanded our thematic lens across the transformation of the key segments of our personal and professional lives.” Felix’s select investments include trusted brands such as Mejuri (jewellery), YFood (nutrition), Highsnobiety (media), Everdrop (sustainable CPG), ANINE BING (fashion), platforms such as Moonbug (kids entertainment), TravelPerk (travel), SellerX (Amazon brands), and enabling technologies and software such as Mirakl (eCommerce SaaS), Lightspark (payments), Juni (SMB banking), and Peppy (health). Behind the impressive portfolio is the strategy behind Felix, whereby the team reinvests into the existing portfolio at key growth infelction points and into external companies within its core themes such as Forter (payments), Ledger (Web3) and Sorare (gaming). David Marcus (ex Meta and Paypal), co-founder and CEO at Lightspark, a Felix portfolio company, noted: “Felix Capital brings an innovative approach to capital investment, and for over a decade I have valued their focus, commitment, and partnership. They are exceptional in supporting founders, with deep expertise and resources, and are fearless in supporting visionary ideas. I am sure these new funds will continue to build on that strong heritage.” With these new funds, Felix will remain committed to its way of practising venture capital, applying a thematic approach, and making conviction-driven, founder-centric investments. Over the next couple of years the freshly announced funds will be pumped into 20-25 companies across Europe and selectively in North America. One key area the firm hpes to grow into is Web3 – regarded as a new platform for creativity, community, and of course entrepreneurship. The urgency to live a more sustainable lifestyle will be a central theme for the Felix portfolio, in line with the firm’s mission to partner with founders who want to have a positive impact on the world. Noura Sakkijha, co-founder and CEO of Mejuri, the leading jewellery brand backed by Felix since Series A, added: “Felix’s deep understanding of brand-building has been very valuable. They realise that building a brand is about art and science, and that it takes time. Running a consumer-centric modern brand implies mastering multiple channels, both online and in real life, for which we can tap into their expertise and network.” In addition, joining Felix are two new experienced investors, María Auersperg de Lera and Sophie Luck, and three new advisors, Maria Raga (Depop CEO), Musa Tariq (senior marketer at brands such as Apple, Nike, Ford, and Airbnb) and Branko Milutinović (founder and CEO of gaming company Nordeus). The VC world is still an exciting place to be!"
2022.6.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/uk-based-ambl-raises-e1-2-million-to-combat-last-minute-cancellations-with-real-time-reservations/,"The hospitality industry is undergoing a transition fuelled by tech and changing consumer culture. After a couple of years of hardship for the sector, new innovations are crucial in reigniting growth and helping companies to grow and succeed. Not only do restaurants, cafes and bars have to deal with financial rollercoasters, but they also have to place trust in consumers and have faith that reservations will be fulfilled. Bringing tech into the equation, London-based Ambl is on a mission to give a much-needed boost to the hospitality sector with its platform giving consumers real-time reservations whilst simultaneously combatting last-minute cancellation culture. The startup has now raised about €1.52 million after just closing its third pre-seed round amongst its extended network which includes existing investor and serial entrepreneur Mark Gordon. Now, Ambl is gearing itself up to launch in September this year. It’s believed that people who don’t show up to reservations made at pubs and restaurants are costing the sector billions every year. It’s frustrating for the owner of the pub/restaurant, but also for those who would have liked to book but couldn’t find a space. Last-minute cancellations and the growing number of no-shows are pushing struggling restaurants and bars closer to the edge. CGA research has highlighted that one in seven (14%) consumers have admitted to not fulfilling their bookings. Last November, Italian restaurant group Gusto reportedly lost £30,000 in a week due to a painful spate of no-shows that saw more than 1,000 guests not turn up for their table. Ambl is on a mission to combat the current loss in revenue and footfall within hospitality venues by filling empty seats that arise from last-minute or same-day cancellations. The startup is taking on the spontaneous market – reflecting changing consumers’ habits towards social life. Ambl offers consumers reservations to restaurants and bars in real-time. So, whether it’s a last-minute work dinner, a rooftop cocktail, or a signature experience at the latest hotspot, Ambl can make it happen. Basically, the startup is using last-minute culture for restaurants’ favour by switching up how they can react to it – helping hospitality providers make money rather than lose money from last-minute decisions. Aaron Solomon, CEO, and Co-Founder of Ambl, commented: “The past two years have been incredibly tough for the hospitality industry. From unprecedented staff shortages and supply change issues to a growing trend in last-minute cancellations as consumer confidence falters, it’s mission-critical that solutions are available to help an industry we know and love, thrive again.” Whilst many hospitality providers already have measures in place to absorb the costs of cancellations, including taking deposits, charging cancellation fees, and blacklisting those customers who repeatedly fail to show up, these solutions aren’t so proactive. They don’t refill the seats. With more and more of us ordering food rather than eating out, restaurants need to take action The startup, founded by Aaron Solomon, Jed Hackling, and Bobby Naaem, is shaking up how people approach their nights out – making it easier for both those going out to find places to go and bars and restaurants to attract people in. The platform gives venues the power and platform to combat the last-minute cancellations and detrimental no-shows, while keeping everything quick, simple, and most importantly visible to the consumer. It also boosts the spontaneous community, reflecting how consumers now prefer to go out and unlocking the joy of last-minute living. Aaron Solomon also said: “Loss of revenue, early closures, and rota nightmares will be a thing of the past thanks to Ambl, which has been designed to give venues the power and the platform to combat the detrimental impact of the last-minute cancellation culture. It’s been created to give consumers the freedom to view and book venues with availability, right here, right now – reducing the headache of roaming around struggling to find availability. Whilst providing visibility to an untapped market for venues.” The fresh funding will fuel the official launch in London this September and accelerate product development. It’ll also be used to accelerate team growth. Serial entrepreneur, Chairman, and lead investor at Ambl, Mark Gordon added: “The concept of Ambl was something I could easily relate to. There was no doubt in my mind, it was a great idea, however, I could see some challenges they would have to overcome with venue adoption and of course the usual pitfalls that exist such as developing succinct messaging when educating consumers in a new marketplace.”"
2022.6.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/our-workplaces-are-still-designed-around-mens-needs-in-a-way-they-arent-for-women-interview-with-anna-franziska-hunger/,"The VC space is a dynamic area. It’s full of fast-paced action, high stress and a common desire to push forward innovation, creation and development. It’s also a space that has a controversial reputation for its commitment to diversity and the creation of supportive work environments. One VC firm making a big effort to change that perception and make the VC space more inclusive to all is KAYA VC. The Prague-based firm, founded in 2010, is an early-stage VC fund with roots in CEE, investing in intrepid founders. Not only are they promoting diverse teams who are focused on innovation, dynamism and sustainability, but the firm also actively promotes this within their own company strategy.  Kaya VC just hired Anna Franziska Hunger as Talent Partner. Despite the fact this shows a commitment to gender inclusivity, it also reflects another pertinent area. Anna was hired whilst she was pregnant – overcoming a hurdle that too many have to unfairly face. We chatted with Anna to hear more about her experience, and how companies can be more supportive of those that choose to become parents and/or are expecting. Getting hired while pregnant – first of all, congrats on the new role! Secondly – can you tell us more about going through the recruitment process whilst pregnant? Thank you so much! I’m happy to tell you more. For context, I already have a 14-month-old daughter, and the second pregnancy came as a surprise. I learned about the Talent Partner Role at KAYA VC when I was exploring several opportunities after my first maternity leave. Entering the VC world was unknown territory for me, as I have spent most of my career in People Ops roles at startups. After interviewing with two of the partners, we decided to go forward with a trial project and see whether there was a fit from both sides. When the project came to an end, I was invited to Prague to meet the team and then had a final interview step with one of the partners. That’s also when I found out I was pregnant again. I was disappointed to stall my career and let go of a great opportunity. Several people encouraged me to simply not mention it at all – ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’. However, I felt strongly about being honest about my pregnancy and I decided to be proactive and share the news. To my surprise, the partners were very happy for me and came back with a contract that included maternity leave. Do you have additional fears and anxieties? The reality is that there never is a guarantee. I cannot predict how I’ll fare with a second baby – of course, the family will always come first. At the same time, I have high expectations of myself and want to do well in both my career and at being a mom. In my experience, this is a feeling shared by a lot of my female friends with babies but less so by our male counterparts. For men, it seems like having a family is regarded as a plus but never as a liability. This is likely because our workplaces are still designed around men’s needs, in a way they aren’t for women. This is then compounded by the fact that outside the office, there are still prevalent societal and cultural expectations for women to be the primary caregiver, and their success or lack thereof is up for public judgment. For example, in Germany there is a derogatory term, “Rabenmutter” to describe a neglectful and unloving mother, the equivalent of which does not exist for fathers. The combination of high expectations put upon mothers, who must also go to work in an environment not designed to help them thrive, puts incredible pressure on working women. How did you feel during the process? I felt confident about choosing to be honest with my prospective employer, but in the back of my mind, I also felt like I may very well be giving up a fantastic opportunity in doing so. Hiring women during their pregnancy is uncommon, therefore I was acutely aware that it might not work out. In the end, receiving an offer for the position confirmed that I was right to be honest, but also demonstrated from the get-go that I was right to choose KAYA as a company. Do you think women have often put off the idea of job hunting whilst pregnant? Why is this the case? Yes, I would 100% agree that women avoid job changes around pregnancy. The hiring process can be stressful, and pregnancy already presents its own challenges. Often it seems like there is little chance to succeed as a pregnant candidate, so many pregnant women might not even try – I haven’t met many pregnant hires myself. Ideally, workplaces should take action to become more inclusive and open-minded, considering pregnant women for positions in the same way they would any other candidate. You recently said: “I decided not to compromise and tell the truth, 6 months pregnant (again). I want to be a role model to my daughter and work for a company that values and empowers working mums that juggle two toddlers.” I think you are so right. How can we ensure more women are taking this stance? It’s important to note that many people’s circumstances might be very different and taking such a risk may not always be an option. For me, there was an opportunity to speak up and be honest. I see it as the only way we can ensure it becomes the accepted ‘norm’. Likewise, it will create transparency around employers’ values and how they really put them into action. Given that VC is also traditionally male-dominated space, how can this sector make life easier, and make having a high-flying career more accessible for people who also want to be parents? There are two aspects: providing flexible work options to accommodate the needs of working moms, combined with creating a culture where there is equal potential for women to succeed and climb the ladder. To give an example: even if I have a part-time job, I could still be promoted to a managerial position. Often women who have children and successful careers find that more people focus on the fact they are a mum, to the detriment of the fact they are successful businesswomen. Do you also think this is the case? I feel like this is deeply ingrained in our societal values, and it starts with recruiting. There are studies that show how women with children are judged as less competent and committed as men, even when their CV is exactly the same. This also translates to lower salary offers (“Minimizing the Motherhood Penalty: What Works, What Doesn’t and Why?” by Shelley J. Correll, Gender & Work: Challenging Conventional Wisdom, Harvard Business School, 2013.) Even though competency wise, women are rated higher in 360 evaluations of management performance than men, and the gap widens at management level (Source: “A Study in Leadership: Women Do It Better Than Men,” Zenger Folkman, 2012), the reality is of course that the higher the management level, the fewer women there are. Obviously leave for mothers is important – what about other measures? And what about paternity leave? I am a big fan of parental leave for all parents. In theory, it removes the idea of gender from the hiring process, i.e., both a male and female candidate could theoretically take an equal amount of leave following the birth of a child, therefore the woman is no longer a ‘riskier’ choice. Denmark, where my husband is from, is very progressive in that. They implemented a new rule where both parents have a set number of weeks for leave. If the dad* (*partner) does not take his share, it elapses. Pretty radical, but I like the idea."
2022.6.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/munich-based-garentii-raises-e1-9-million-to-make-renting-more-accessible-and-affordable/,"Renting property is something most Europeans do at some point in their lives. Whether as a student, a young professional, or even a retiree – renting property is an incredibly popular way for Europeans to have a roof over their head. But – it’s increasingly becoming a problematic area. Inflation, rising deposits, and skyrocketing rental prices are just some of the big hurdles facing the millions of renters across the continent. Aiming to fix this by making renting more inclusive, affordable and realistic, Munich-based Garentii has just scooped up €1.9 million for its specialised rental platform. The funding, which will help the young startup launch, was led by Greenlight Re’s Innovations arm and followed by Dublin-based Elkstone Ventures and German private investors. Founded in 2021, Garentii offers an easy all-in-one tool that simplifies security deposit management for landlords whilst also making renting affordable and accessible. It was developed by finance specialist Michael Hazoume (CEO), real estate expert Dennis Stern (CBDO) and software expert Vitaliy Zhovtyuk (CTO). CEO and Co-founder, Michael Hazoume, explained: “Paying cash deposit is just not fun. It is one of the most inefficient use of capital for renters and an admin burden for landlords. We want to make rental transactions simpler, more affordable and inclusive to everyone.“ The vision behind Garentii is to bring about a shift in renting behaviour, to use digital security deposit insurance to effectively ‘unfreeze’ the estimated €30 billion that sit as cash deposits in bank accounts in Germany alone. Paying a rent deposit has never been an enjoyable experience. It’s a massive lump of money that then generally sits in a bank account without benefitting the local economy, whilst being a massive expenditure for the renter. In today’s context of skyrocketing prices and soaring inflation – it’s just not feasible and something has to change. Renters are increasingly demanding more flexibility and cash-light alternatives. With Garentii, instead of the usual 3 months’ rent in a cash deposit, renters pay a monthly fee starting at just €3. The all-in-one tool replaces traditional rental deposits and, for landlords, simplifies the time-consuming process of managing cash deposits while providing absolute security in the event of damage or unpaid rent with 48-hour pay-out on claims. The platform allows landlords to manage all their deposit policies in one single place without the typical administrative burden of a deposit. It lets renters find a place to live without the financial toll of a big lump sum. CEO and Co-founder, Michael Hazoume, said: “We´ve built an embedded insurance solution that creates value not only for renters but for real estate landlords”. Garentii will launch first in Germany, which is Europe’s largest housing market and 55% of its population is renting. The market launch is planned for June. The company plans to expand into other countries later this year. Simon Burton, Chief Executive Officer at Greenlight Re, said: “Security deposit replacement insurance has already seen success in the U.S. and is a great product for replication in other markets. By developing a tech platform for landlords to distribute and administer policies, Garentii will make renting an apartment smoother for both landlord and tenant.“ Alan Merriman, CEO and Co-Founder of Elkstone also commented: “Garentii has the potential to tackle the inefficiencies of the rental market and lower the barrier to renting for both landlords and renters. The Garentii team has a deep understanding of the real estate market, and has built the digital platform it needs to execute on its mission to disrupt the rental system across Europe. Elkstone is proud to be support the team in its journey to realising this vision.”"
2022.6.9,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/amsterdam-based-instant-commerce-gets-e2-million-funding-boost-for-its-headless-storefront-builder/,"With a platform that enables ecommerce brands to build a high-end webshop without any technical knowledge, Instant Commerce has just secured €2 million and is now looking to expand. The ecommerce industry is rapidly growing and it’s now fair to say that the vast majority of businesses operate online in some capacity. Consumers demand the ability to check out products and services online, pay and order online and interact online. Building an online presence is crucial in the digital age, however, building that presence can be a tricky task. Making it easier, by developing a next-generation headless storefront builder, Dutch startup Instant Commerce has just picked up €2 million in a pre-seed funding round led by firstminute capital. The founders of Storyblok, Wandera, Snyk and Supercell also contributed to the round. Based in Amsterdam, the platform enables brands to quickly build a highly functional and engaging headless webshop without the need for technical expertise or a costly development team thanks to its no-code approach. Founded only in 2022, the startup has already landed more than 30 major clients including Bols, ID&T, Ekster, and Yaya. Coen Van Hees, Founder and CEO of Instant Commerce, explained: “Consumer expectations of the functionality and services online retailers should offer has grown exponentially over the past few years. This race to make online storefronts more engaging has led to much higher costs, strained infrastructure and a severe drain on resources. For many companies, it’s simply too costly to compete. This is the problem Instant Commerce solves. By making building and maintaining a headless storefront as simple and cost-effective as possible, we give power back to business owners.” The Instant Commerce platform does what it says on the tin as the saying goes. It makes ecommerce available instant for brands. It integrates with a variety of different systems like Shopify, Storyblok, Algolia and more using APIs – making it accessible to all. Further, owing to the headless approach (which means the frontend and backend are separated), brands can finally deliver on the expectation of today’s consumers: fast-site speed, omnichannel presence, a unique shopping experience and more. Coen Van Hees added: “There’s a huge demand for our platform. In only four short months we’ve secured more than 30 clients including big names like Bols and ID&T. Now, with the support of Firstminute Capital and our Angel Investors we’ll be able to rapidly expand our team, platform and start preparations for entering more international markets.” The young team have quickly developed a service that enables ecommerce companies of any size to compete with the online offering of the world’s biggest brands at the fraction of the cost and time – claiming to cut the build time of a webshop drop from four months to less than a week and significantly reducing costs in the process. Sam Endacott at firstminute capital, said: “We believe the future of web development and e-commerce is headless and have had a front-row seat in this category with our investments in Storyblok and Nuxt. However, the missing link has been a software layer to co-ordinate the ecosystem of APIs from the front-end that can be used by both non-technical users and developers. The Instant Commerce team have experienced this pain-point directly having built a highly successful e-commerce Agency before working with major global brands. Their first product – a no-code solution to help e-commerce teams go headless without technical expertise – is just the first step in what we think can be a major platform in facilitating the next wave of e-commerce growth.” The new capital will be used to double the team, further develop the platform and build brand awareness throughout Europe."

2022.6.9,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/utrecht-based-trunkrs-raises-e15-million-to-keep-european-ecommerce-trucking-forward/,"Bringing sustainability and efficiency to parcel delivery, Dutch startup Trunkrs has just raised €15 million in Series B funding and sets its sights on becoming a market leader in the Benelux. Utrecht-based startup Trunkrs is on a mission to improve same day and next day delivery offerings for the growing ecommerce sector. The company, founded in 2015, has now raised €15 million in a new funding round led by Korys. Joining the Belgian investment company to back Trunkrs, is VP Capital and SET Ventures. IMPROVED Corporate Finance advised and supported Trunkrs in raising the financing. Launched with the goal to increase sustainability in the last mile of parcel delivery, Trunkrs uses existing delivery trucks and distribution centres within the delivery chain to keep its footprint small and delivery fast. The company is one of the Netherlands’ leading delivery partners to premium ecommerce players, and, in 2021 expanded to Flanders. Many webshops, including Mediamarkt, trust Trunkrs with the fast, reliable and flexible delivery of their parcels. Keeping sustainability to the fore, the startup is also taking an active step to electrify partner’s vehicle fleets whilst keeping their own footprint small. Jan Wijn, the CEO, explained: “Within our sector, we are active accelerators in increasing sustainability. Thanks to the investment by Korys, VP Capital and SET Ventures we are able to strengthen our position as market leader in the Netherlands and expand our market presence in Belgium, so that Belgian webshops can profit from our fast and reliable parcel delivery. This will increase our impact and that makes us proud.” The delivery industry, particularly in the age of heightened demand for fast deliveries, has been getting criticism for its impact on the environment. But Trunkrs want to change this and are ensuring that sustainability is embedded into business approaches. It’s also been a key part of this investment. Guus van Puijenbroek, Director VP Capital commented: “This investment will allow Trunkrs to stimulate the electrification of parcel delivery even further and to realise greater reductions of CO2 emissions in the ever growing e-commerce market. Our evaluation has also shown that Trunkrs holds their partners to high standards regarding working conditions and sustainability. The co-operation with Korys and SET Ventures for the investment in Trunkrs and the vision and innovative solutions of the company fit seamlessly with our ambition to put our capital towards furthering sustainable progress.” Brieuc de Hults, Investment Director at Korys, added: “Not only do they offer a reliable, sustainable and fast delivery solution, they enable small and medium-sized webshops to be competitive in a fair manner and to offer their customers premium and sustainable delivery options similar to larger e-commerce platforms and in doing so, they stimulate more local e-commerce. They are already market leaders in the Netherlands and together with VP Capital and SET Ventures, we will make sure that Trunkrs also conquers the Belgian market. “ The capital boost will be used to support Trunkrs growth plans, which include becoming a market leader in the Benelux and increasing sustainability throughout the entire parcel delivery chain. Sherief Rahim, Executive Director at IMPROVED, commented: “As the fundamentals of the e-commerce sector remains strong and same-day delivery is increasingly the norm for consumers, Trunkrs is well-positioned to become the category leader both in terms of its technology and commitment to electrification of fleet partners. Through the Series B growth financing, Trunkrs will rapidly reach new heights, and accelerate its leadership position throughout the Benelux logistics market and beyond.”"
2022.6.9,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/french-fintech-startup-request-finance-banks-e5-1-million-to-simplify-enterprise-crypto-payments/,"The crypto space is booming and with that comes the need for innovative finance solutions. Paris-based Request Finance is paving the way for enterprises to simplify payments and has just raised about €5.1 million. Request Finance is a Web3 enterprise crypto payments provider that is disrupting the fintech space with its platform that is helping companies manage and automate invoicing, expenses, payroll and accounting. The Paris-based company has just closed a €5.1 million seed round with backers such as Animoca Brands, Balderton Capital and XAnge. The startup has also attracted an eye-catching lineup of Web3 founders as backers – giving even more credence to the innovation. The likes of Sebastien Borget co-founder and COO at The Sandbox, Michael Kong, CEO of Fantom, Stani Kulechov, founder and CEO of Aave, and Julien Bouteloup, Founder of StakeDAO have all got involved. Launched in 2021, Request Finance is aiming to address common pain points with enterprise crypto payments – most commonly being financial reporting and regulatory compliance. Given the massive boom across Web3 verticals, the startup is growing fast and offering an increasingly demanded service. DeFi companies like Aave, metaverse and NFT-related projects like The Sandbox, and DAOs like Maker are some examples of businesses that will benefit from Request Finance. With enterprise-friendly features like on-chain payment confirmations, automated billing, mark-to-market exchange rates, and integrations with accounting software like Xero, Request Finance has rapidly grown to become the leading enterprise crypto payments platform. Already, the young company has simplified financial operations for over 1,900 teams! Christophe Lassuyt, CEO and co-founder of Request Finance, said: “We are encouraged by the overwhelming interest that we have received from our early adopters. Compliance-friendly companies choose Request Finance to document their crypto transactions, and love the experience.” With increasing calls for crypto payments to be regulated under existing tax and anti-money laundering laws, Request Finance offers enterprises an easy way to document critical information about their crypto payments which are typically required by the authorities. Maxime Le Dantec, Principal at Balderton Capital, commented: “The popularity of cryptocurrencies poses serious challenges to CFOs and their teams. Bank accounts are increasingly replaced by wallets, financial institutions now compete with decentralized lending protocols, and legacy payment networks are being replaced by blockchains. The traditional enterprise finance software stack made of tools like Melio payments or Bill.com is less relevant than a crypto-native tool like Request Finance.” The fresh funding boost will be used to continue growing Request Finance’s global footprint as well as to expand its in-app services to include invoice financing, escrow, and even yield-farming. These features are aimed at helping enterprises better manage their crypto-financial operations. Given this space is growing fast, the possibilities and space for Request Finance to grow are exponential. Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, added: “The opportunities that lie in powering payments for the open metaverse have attracted a number of large, traditional payment companies. But crypto-native solutions like Request Finance play a critical role in addressing the needs of Web3 enterprises and their communities.” The startup has also attracted a wide range of professional services firms serving Web3 companies like accounting firms, PR companies, and event organizers. It has also seen growing interest from Web2 tech companies, as more clients inquire about paying in crypto. The rise in remote work is one of the factors helping to fuel this rapid growth and demand for Request Finance’s services, as more remote-first teams are turning to the firm to manage their global payroll in crypto. The Parisian fintech team has also backed Web3cfo.club – a rapidly-growing, exclusive community of Finance and Operations leaders at prominent Web3 companies like Bankless, Consensys, Edge and Node, The Sandbox, and others. Sebastien Borget, Co-Founder and COO of metaverse giant, The Sandbox, who personally backed the company’s seed round, said: “We’ve been looking for a robust solution to enable the crypto payments of hundreds of monthly invoices; salaries and various expenses generated through our activity; Request Finance has been the go-to solution that delivered above our expectations and that scales as The Sandbox keeps expanding the open metaverse.” Michael Kong, CEO of the Fantom Foundation, said: “Request Finance has been key in providing crypto payments and invoicing services for the Fantom ecosystem. Their intuitive and efficient payment infrastructure has proven essential for freelancers and their clients in an era of remote work.”"

Helping companies enjoy this journey, Swedish startup Juni has picked up more than €192 million for its fintech tools helping ecommerce innovators scale and succeed. The digital era has brought about massive changes in habits – one of the most notable being consumer preferences. Ecommerce capabilities are now essential for most businesses as consumers want to browse online, order online and pay online. Offering an all-in-one integrated payment solution for ecommerce companies, Juni has just picked up a mega €192 million to help businesses scale up and unlock their ecommerce potential. Mubadala Capital led the round alongside TriplePoint Capital, with previous backers EQT Ventures, Felix Capital, Cherry Ventures and Partners of DST Global also participating. It comes after an €18.1 million round in 2021. Founded in 2021 and launched in 2021, Juni has found a gap in the fintech market – the needs of ecommerce SMBs. The company acts as a financial companion for the next generation of digital-first companies. The platform frees teams’ time up as it relieves them from administrative burdens so they can focus on growing the business. The tool integrates with banks and major payment providers, and, it automates routine functions. With Juni, companies can get a complete overview of their finances as it pulls together physical and virtual cards, credit cards, accounting data, analytics and digital advertising platforms. Juni co-founder and CEO Samir El-Sabini, commented: “We’re very proud to have secured this funding in such a challenging environment. I know first-hand the frustrations of running an e-commerce business and time wasted on spend management, the lack of visibility of cash flow, and scaling ad campaigns.” Ecommerce companies are growing – and this gives ecommerce entrepreneurs more responsibilities and more financial elements to track. With Juni, analytics around a company’s financials are optimized. The platform includes about 2,400 integrations with tools that companies might use for their accounting, digital advertising, payments on websites and so on. It makes it a really valuable tool for companies of all sizes and all scopes. Mubadala’s Fatou Bintou Sagnang, added: “Despite unprecedented market conditions, we believe fundamental trends are here to stay. Traditional financial institutions continue to underserve the SMB e-commerce market – a customer segment that requires speed, simplicity, and real-time analytics to grow and scale. In Juni, we see a company with strong traction and a fantastic management team addressing this service gap through an inclusive financial product that is tailor-made for the e-commerce market.” This new capital boost will be used by the Swedish startup to rapidly scale. The credit card offers, which is tailored to help ecommerce players themselves succeed, will be a development priority. In addition, the company has plans to expand globally and ramp up recruitment."
2022.6.10,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/finnish-startup-aeromon-raises-e4-8-million-to-fuel-emission-reduction/,"As the pressure to get to net-zero carbon emissions ramps up across Europe, Aeromon is helping energy and process industries reduce emissions and avoid product loss through its unique monitoring technology. The Finnish company just raised €4.8 million. Across Europe, the race is on to adopt solutions that will help create a more sustainable planet – to protect it for generations to come. European governments are ramping up legislation and regulations across industries to ensure that ambitious goals are met and it’s increasing pressure on business owners to take action. Finnish startup Aeromon is on a mission to help the energy and process industries reduce emissions, avoid product loss, and, improve work safety with a unique emission monitoring technology. The company has today announced a raise of €4.8 million. A capital loan from The Finnish Climate Fund is part of the financing package, of which €2.4 million was raised from industrial investors, Vopak Ventures, and the company’s current shareholders. Founded in 2015, Aeromon develops emission monitoring technology that includes hardware and software, providing mobile emission monitoring services to both industry and authorities. With the tech, users get more oversight on their emissions and so are better placed to take action. Customers are provided with visual, real-time, actionable data that enables better decision-making. After all, with greater awareness, more action can be taken. Further, according to the startup, the tech leads to improved leak detection accuracy and can quantify leaking emissions 10x quicker than traditional methods. Already Aeromon’s services are used by companies throughout Europe to verify and quantify emissions from industrial plants and its been proven to create value in complex and demanding environments for example within oil and gas, chemical, waste management, energy, and mining industries. These industries are the key polluters across Europe so this marks an incredibly positive sign for European efforts to reach climate objectives. Leo Brand, CIO of Royal Vopak, commented: “The activities of Aeromon very well match with the ambition of Vopak Venture’s sustainability fund in which we identify investment opportunities in start-ups and scale-ups in new technologies to make the industry more sustainable. It is our pleasure to become an active partner in Aeromon’s journey.” Currently, Aeromon is primarily serving silence in Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Slovenia and France. The aim is to be able to serve Central European clients more efficiently by having an operational team now in Rotterdam and eventually in other major industrial cities in Europe. The new capital boost will also be used to further advance data analysis capabilities for rapid leak detection and accurate quantification of emissions. Maria Kuosa, CEO of Aeromon, said: We’re proud to be joined by a leading global company like Vopak on our journey to visualize and report leaks and support industrial companies in emission reduction. Amongst improvements in the technology and service portfolio this funding enables Aeromon to be closer to a major market by opening a permanent office in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.”"

2022.6.10,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/tallinn-based-timbeter-picks-up-e500k-to-make-forestry-more-sustainable/,"Forests are an incredibly important environmental resource. To make sure that they are more sustainably managed, Tallinn-based Timbeter has raised €500k for its greentech solution. On a mission to make forestry more sustainable, ‘one log at a time’, Timbeter is a greentech startup using AI to protect and better manage European forests. The Estonian startup just raised €500k in a funding round led by Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute. Forestry is an important and controversial issue. It’s been reported that world forests are declining at an alarming rate at great expense to our planet’s wellbeing and societal sustainability. It’s now estimated that world forests have decreased by a third in size over the last century due to reckless practices. Today, the timber industry is dominated by companies formed in the 19th century who are under increasing pressure for supply chain transparency, sustainability and certification, in line with ESG processes. Founded in 2013, Timbeter specialises in timber measurement and data management by using AI and Machine Learning technologies. It basically allows anyone with a smartphone to measure log diameters, log count and log pile density in minutes. This can then be used by companies to have greater oversight of their forestry data. Anna-Greta Tsahkna, CEO of Timbeter, explained: “The forestry sector needs a digital transformation in order to become more sustainable, transparent and efficient. This collaboration with the FII Institute will enable Timbeter to deliver this important message to high-level decision-makers, aiming to help countries mitigate climate change, fight against illegal logging and ensure sustainability across the sector.” A recent benchmarking study conducted by Poznan University in Poland demonstrated that Timbeter’s results were statistically identical to the ground truth physical measurements, despite requiring less time and cost. Claiming an accuracy for timber measurement at 95% or above and a timber database of 1.5 million images, Timber is now trusted by global blue-chip corporates who supply and use lumber as well as state government forest owners. Richard Attias, CEO of the FII Institute, said: “We are delighted to partner with a leading green tech company like Timbeter. Through utilising machine learning technology and artificial intelligence, Timbeter is creating innovative solutions for the management of forests, which will help ensure sustainable practices across the timber industry.” With demand for timber growing, this investment in Timbeter will help prevent illegal logging while sustaining the world’s forests as a key source of habitation and livelihood. It’ll help support the development of technologies that address the world’s biggest social and environmental challenges."
2022.6.10,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/copenhagen-based-foodtech-startup-reduced-scores-e2-9-million-to-take-on-food-waste/,"Food waste is a growing problem that we simply can’t continue to allow. It’s bad for the food supply chain, and the environment, and, intolerable in the context of global food shortages. To solve the issue, foodtech startup Reduced is using taste. Danish startup Reduced is on a mission to solve one of the biggest challenges of our time – food waste. And they are doing so by enhancing excess produce. Founded in 2020, the young company has just cooked up €2.9 million in a fresh funding round led by Vækstfonden and VÅR Ventures, alongside Rockstart, Pollen Capital and business angels. Food waste is a global problem – and it impacts on an environmental level, a societal one, and a financial one. Tackling the issue can make society more sustainable, the planet healthier, and businesses have improved revenues across all levels of the food supply chain, from farm to fork. Reduced wants to make it as easy as possible for consumers to reduce food waste and are doing so through taste. It’s reported that taste is the most important consideration for consumers when choosing a product and so the Danish startup is harnessing the power of our tastebuds to reduce waste. The company uses vegetables, protein and other sources of nutrition left over from the food industry to create high-quality food products – namely base ingredients and flavour enhancers. One example is the development of stock. Stock is one of the main ingredients and elements of professional and home cooking. It’s also a product that can be easily made with vegetable and alt-protein sources. Reduced uses the ‘ugly’ veg that is rejected by supermarkets (simply because it doesn’t look ‘pretty’ enough to hit the shelves), seaweed and other products in its recipes. Mark Durno, Managing Partner AgriFood, Rockstart stated: “It is past time that we valorise food industry side streams into delicious products that consumers and chefs love. Rockstart invested a third time in REDUCED because they are well-positioned to make this impact thanks to their rare team of chefs, technicians, biochemists and trailblazers.” Reduced’s flavour solutions are centred around umami and match well with plant-based meat analogues. In addition, its flavour solutions are organic, without additives and made from side streams and excess produce. The company uses ingredients that traditionally wouldn’t be used – because of texture, shape, size or colour. Reduced doesn’t discriminate food for these reasons – focusing on the food quality rather than aesthetics. In the Copenhagen-based production facility, the startup uses fermentation techniques to create its unique products which, unlike traditional other natural plant-based flavour enhancers such as miso and tamari, take significantly less time to produce. The team are disrupting the food industry and pushing producers and stockists to reconsider how they approach food waste – giving a much-needed wake-up call to the sector. Emil Munck de Voss, CEO and Co-Founder, Reduced said: “We have now built our production facility in Copenhagen and finalized new production technology for the creation of flavor enhancers from upcycled ingredients. This round will allow us to increase production with more bioreactors, hire great talent, expand distribution and go deep into the plant-based market. We are excited to welcome new investors, Vækstfonden and VÅR ventures on board and see our existing investors, Rockstart, Pollen Capital, and our business angels doing follow up investments. This shows great trust in the company and in our mission to reduce food waste through taste.” The fresh funding will be used to develop the startup’s unique technology that’s used for the creation of plant-based flavour enhancers, expand its production facilities and attract talent."

The fashion industry has long been criticised for its tendency to leave people feeling discriminated against and excluded. It’s a sector that has generally promoted one specific body type to the detriment of many. Shaking this up, Lalaland is using AI to enable brands and retailers to use hyper-realistic models of every body type, size and skin tone. Gone are the days of the generic mannequin that represents a very small proportion of the population. Founder and CEO, Michael Musandu, explained: “Our product is centred around solving the issues of consumers who feel underrepresented in terms of ethnicity, gender identity, and body representation. So we want to work with people who can relate to these issues, in order to facilitate positive change in co-creation.” The Amsterdam-based startup has just picked up €2.1 million in new funding, led by Orange Wings, Unknown Group, and angel investors (including former Nike General Manager Bart de Wilde, Google’s Amhar Ford and Thorsten Koch, and Christina Caljé from Autheos). The vision is to create a more inclusive, personal, and sustainable shopping experience for fashion brands, retailers, and customers. Founded in 2019, using tech to drive inclusivity and diversity within digital fashion is the core vision of Lalaland and the company centres itself around two objectives – social empowerment and sustainable impact. In taking an impact-first approach, the startup is also well primed to enter a gap in a lucrative market. The world of fashion ecommerce is reported to be worth around €380 billion and it’s constantly expanding. According to Lalaland, 7.5% of annual revenue is spent on photography, production, and models for product pages. Lalaland taps into that market with a cost-effective model-generating tool that replaces time-consuming and costly photoshoots. The self-service platform allows anyone to recreate high-quality photoshoots with great ease. Models can be tailored to customer profiles or customized to specific body types, allowing for hyper-personalization. This helps boost sales, reduces return rates and costs, increases conversion, cuts waste, and contributes to a more inclusive shopping and brand experience. Orange Wings founder and CEO Shawn Harris said: “This is a unique opportunity to help retailers and brands truly create positive change in the fashion industry and to reduce returns and ultimately waste.” Angel investor Bart de Wilde added: “I have been at the heart of this problem in sports, footwear, and apparel, so I can’t stress enough how valuable this will be for our industry.” With the new funding in the bag, the young innovators plan to continue their commercial expansion and attract a diverse group of talent. Already the team has onboarded some of the largest fashion retailers, such as Zalando, Wehkamp, and Otto."

Today, there is exciting news in the climate tech space. A new fund – Planet Fund – has launched to back early-stage startups and innovators. Powered by Founders Factory and Sky Ocean Ventures, the fund is raising about €116 million to fuel the next generation of sustainable tech. Hoping to plug the funding gap that exists for seed-stage climate startups, Planet Fund offers entrepreneurs Founders Factory’s robust approach to company building with high-conviction capital, execution support and an unparalleled network. The fund is earmarked for those innovations and disruptive ideas that focus on sustainability themes, including decarbonisation, resource preservation, climate resilience and the circular economy. The fund will offer not only money to these startups, but also hands-on support. Sky will support Planet Fund by building on decades of successful environmental initiatives including its ongoing net zero commitment – Sky Zero. Sky plans to move Sky Ocean Ventures – and the 25 startups it has invested in since its launch in 2018 – into the Planet Fund, which will include the proceeds from the sale of paper bottle maker Choose Packaging to Hewlett Packard. Debbie Klein, Group Chief Marketing, Corporate Affairs and People Officer said: “We are delighted to partner with the Founders Factory who are the perfect fit to take forward our work investing in businesses that will accelerate climate technologies and deliver a cleaner, safer future and more sustainable behaviours. We look forward to the impact that this new fund will have for early-stage climate tech entrepreneurs.” It also reflects how Founders Factory is stepping up its climate tech focus. Last year, the firm launched G-Force, a pre-seed investment programme for climate startups, partnered with social innovation agency Nesta to create new ventures tackling household carbon emissions and recently announced an ocean technology program – the Blue Action Lab. Founded in 2015, Founders Factors combines capital and bespoke support from a team of over 100 specialists with a broad network of corporates and established entrepreneurs. The firm is dedicated to scaling the technology solving global problems. Its impressive portfolio includes over 300 category-defining tech companies globally, 50+ of which have been built from scratch in its Venture Studio. The company has hubs across the world, including in London, Johannesburg, New York and Miami. Henry Lane Fox, Chief Executive Officer at Founders Factory, said: “We felt compelled to build this fund both by the urgency of the problem and the scale of the opportunity. We’ve seen a huge migration of tech talent wanting to work in the climate, and know there is a gap to provide high-conviction capital & hands on support to the next generation of ambitious planet focused companies. We’re excited to have Sky, one of Europe’s leading voices on climate, as our first partner.” The fund will be led by Henry Lane Fox (CEO of Founders Factory, Partner at firstminute capital and Chairman of Creator Fund) and Jamie Rowles (former Head of Investments at Sky Ocean Ventures), alongside Chief Impact Officer Micol Chiesa (formerly Head of Impact at Five Seasons Ventures) and Camilla Mazzolini, ClimateTech investor (formerly at firstminute capital) supported by Founders Factory’s 100+ global operators. The three leaders will give a wealth of experience and knowledge to the fund. Alongside Founders Factory Executive Chairman, Brent Hoberman CBE, Planet Fund has already lined up an advisory board including chairman Sir Ian Cheshire, and prominent climate scientists Professor Richard Templer, and Professor Cameron Hepburn. The investment team will also be supported by a roster of venture partners and advisers from climate technology companies including Ovo Energy, Mindful Chef and Zero Avia. Planet Fund will also build on Hoberman and Lane Fox’s wider climate initiatives such as the Founders Forum Group’s Climate Tech community, the Founders Pledge philanthropic institute and firstminute capital’s investments in Fork & Goode, Vitro Labs and Airly, as well as angel investments in Dioxcycle, Twist and Pangaia. Brent Hoberman, founding advisor and Founders Factory Executive Chairman said: “We are delighted to partner with Sky and to build on their track record for environmental activism. Their reach and voice coupled with our entrepreneurial DNA will allow us to invest in and nurture the best climate entrepreneurs who can help to unlock a more sustainable future for us all.”"
2022.6.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/french-startup-just-lands-e3-million-to-revolutionize-online-shopping/,"With ecommerce booming across Europe, consumers are increasingly looking for a seamless experience. Giving digital businesses the chance to offer 1-click payments, JUST has just picked up €3 million. Launched only 6 months ago, French startup JUST wants to empower businesses to increase their conversion rate by simplifying the consumer purchasing experience. The company just raised €3 million in its first financing round. The funding was led by Otium Capital as well as prestigious business angels such as Didier Valet (Former Deputy CEO Société Générale Group), Jon Oringer (Founder of Shutterstock), Edward Lando (Founder of Pareto Holdings), Arthur Waller (Co-founder of Pennylane) and Nima Karimi (Co-founder of Silvr). Founded in Paris by Jérémy Pinto and Benjamin Cohen Aloro, JUST specializes in payment solutions for ecommerce players. The fintech startup offers a 1-click purchasing solution that can help increase conversion by a reported 20% on average as it streamlines the whole customer journey. Ecommerce is booming across Europe and in France alone, the market was valued at over €112 billion in 2020. It’s expected to double by 2026. It’s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by the pandemic but represents a massive shift in consumer habits and patterns.Despite the massive popularity of online shopping, it’s still something facing many pitfalls and frustrations for consumers. Account creation and purchasing processes are key sitkcing points. As a result, the average cart abandonment rate remains high. JUST have developed an innovative 1-click purchasing solution to shake up the sector, solving existing issues and boosting online shopping sales considerably. With JUST, customers no longer need to set up an account, log in, and fill in the same information over and over again for every purchase they make. So many steps that erode the customer’s shopping experience and increase cart abandonment rates. Jérémy Pinto, co-founder of JUST said: “The one-click shopping experience is the most appreciated by online buyers. It has been used for over 20 years by Amazon and contributed to its success. With JUST, we want to democratize this shopping experience for all e-merchants who lose an average of 42% of their customers due to an overly complex purchasing journey. In addition, our solution is 100% French and evolving in compliance with European GDPR and DSP2 standards, which is a true asset for French customers, who are more and more aware about these issues.” Already the young startup is being trusted by about 60 e-merchants to fuel payments. On average the brands, which include L’Avant-Gardiste, Puissante and Noo, have seen a reported 19% conversion rate increase, card abandonment rate decrease by 11%, and, consumers able to make purchases much quicker. Looking to the future, the french fintech disruptors clearly have a promising journey ahead. The funding will be used to facilitate 1-click online purchasing by recruiting around thirty employees, before expanding to Europe by 2023. Jérémie Bordier, Venture Partner at Otium Capital said: “The one-click shopping experience is addictive and will clearly become an e-commerce standard in the years to come. JUST offers a universal solution for this need, that works on the web and mobile applications regardless of the type of hardware.

Research spin-off from TU Braunschweig, OKAPI: Orbits has just raised €5.5 million for its software that is making space operations safer and more efficient. OKAPI: Orbits has developed a space traffic management software that is helping to coordinate and optimize the operations of satellites, rockets and sensors. As a result of the increasing number of activities in space coupled with dangerous amounts of debris, assets in space face frequent interferences, close approaches, and potential collisions. OKAPI: Orbits want to better manage this. The German startup has just picked ip €5.5 million in a seed funding round helping to skyrocket the software. The funding was led by San Francisco-based MunichRe Ventures, the venture capital arm of Munich RE Group, with participation from US firm, Dolby Family Ventures, and European VCs Herius Capital and APEX Ventures. Experienced private investors Andreas Kupke, founder of Finanzcheck, and Christian Dahlen, software executive at SAP, also participated in the round alongside Ingo Luge, the former CEO of E.ON, and Michael Oxfort, the founder of the first commercial satellite constellation. Founded in 2018, OKAPI: Orbits is on a mission to make space operations safer, more sustainable and more efficient. The spacetech startup has developed a platform that, utilizing selective data sets and algorithms, helps to avoid collisions and interferences, in order to secure an interruption-free use of tech in space. Space technology is increasingly used to help manage and optimize modern life on earth – with a range of use cases, including climate change monitoring, communications and beyond. As we continue to unlock and harness the potential space has to enhance life on earth, we need to make sure we optimize the management of assets in what is becoming a crowded space. OKAPI: Orbits aggregates a very precise and holistic map of objects and actions conducted in space in its Space Traffic Management software. The platform fuses radar, telescope, in-orbit sensors, and laser-ranging data to an independent data set, which predicts risk, interferences, and environmental impacts with a high degree of accuracy. This assessment helps operators to extend the lifetime of their space assets by several months, reduce costs in operations by a reported factor of 10, and increase the reliability of their services. OKAPI: Orbits Co-Founder and CEO Kristina Nikolaus, explained: “Our overarching mission is to help operators to increase the lifetime of their assets with a minimal ecological footprint, keeping their investments safe and taking advantage of the great opportunities the booming space market has to offer for solving earth’s problems.” Already, the pioneering startup has shown value in its product by providing services to more than 50 spacecraft in orbit and over 150 registered users across the globe in Europe, the United States and Asia-Pacific. OKAPI: Orbits also offers risk analysis, full simulation capabilities, and tools to ensure compliance with regulations and industry standards. Kristina Nikolaus added: “We’re building the first-ever tool designed to maximize profits and secure zero impact in the precious space environment. With OKAPI: Orbits, everyone who is working in and with space has can access critical information with just one click, integration into customer systems takes less than 10 minutes, and operators know exactly how missions can be optimized without interfering with others. The opportunity here is massive: more than 70 thousand satellites will be operated in low Earth orbits within the next decades – almost seven times more satellites than launched between 1957 and 2020. This new funding will be used to expand the userbase further, as well as continue to develop and enhance the product portfolio and grow OKAPI’s international footprint in the space situational awareness market. Ingo Luge, an angel investor in OKAPI: Orbits, said: “OKAPI: Orbits addresses a critical and underserviced market. I believed early in the extraordinary capabilities of the OKAPI team members. They are pioneering the commercial market for Space Traffic Management and collision avoidance services.”"
2022.6.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/milan-based-boom-acquires-lemonone-as-the-demand-for-visual-content-soars/,"Across Europe, there are two sectors which are continuing to skyrocket at a remarkable pace – ecommerce and visual content. Pioneering visual content SaaS startup BOOM has just acquired LemonOne and continues to grow its groundbreaking platform. Founded in 2018 originally out of a love for photography, BOOM quickly took off. The startup was regarded as one of Europe’s fastest-growing tech startups in 2020, and, this year the co-founders Jacopo Benedetti, Federico Mattia Dolci and Giacomo Grattirola were named in the Forbes 30 under 30 Technology List 2022. This acquisition news is another exciting milestone for this startup we’ve all had our eyes on. Federico Mattia Dolci, CEO at BOOM said: “This is a major leap forward in BOOM’s strategy to serve the whole of Europe and beyond through our ground-breaking digital platform. We have been growing our team across Europe and the Americas, and we are now delighted to join forces with the team from LemonOne. They bring fresh energy, passion as well as a wealth of vertical expertise. We look forward to doing great things together!” “We have always thought about BOOM’s mission in the long term to build somethingthat innovates the market, reaching as many companies as possible, globally, andfor digital businesses of all sizes and across many industries. This is what we werefounded for.” Based in Milan, BOOM was launched with the aim to transform the world of visual content management through the use of tech. It was a visionary approach, and now, just a few years later, visual content is more important than ever before – making BOOM’s offering all the more relevant. The startup has created a ‘Visual Production Platform’ which allows businesses all over the world to get visual content such as photos and videos delivered at the click of a button. Its SaaS platform offers a fast production speed and API integrations, to streamline entire photoshoot lifecycles, from booking to final delivery. We chatted to the CEO, Federico, in 2021 and in 2020 as the team skyrocketed into Europe’s startup space. In the past three years, the Italian team has raised over €15 million and now has clients across 80 countries. Now with ecommerce heating up, more and more businesses need digital visual content. Founded in Berlin in 2017 by Maximilian Schwahn, Lorenz Marquardt and Timur Kayaci, LemonOne has grown to serve online marketplaces, real estate agencies and food delivery companies with on-demand, tailor-made visual content for their digital presence. The startup’s platform intelligently connects companies and photographers – creating an incredibly convenient way to book photo shorts and enhance content creation. Maximilian Schwahn, Co-Founder at LemonOne commented: “BOOM is breaking the ground to develop a revolutionary category leader in the space of visual asset management while LemonOne built a European market leader for digital photo production. By joining forces and being able to offer every company a one-stop-shop solution for booking, collaborating and publishing visuals, we are able to reach our founding vision even faster. Therefore, we are super happy to partner up with BOOM and benefit from each other’s strength to make 1+1=3 for all our customers as well as our community”. The acquisition of LemonOne gives BOOM to tap into the booming ecommerce space. For the BOOM team, this offers a real opportunity to take control of the European visual content market and by joining forces with LemonOne, they can leverage even more capabilities and expertise. As commented by Federico: “The backdrop to all this is that images, video, drone footage, 3d mapping of spaces for the real estate market, and so on – the demand for all these have skyrocketed in recent years, especially during the pandemic. E-Commerce is just now waking up to how much of their time and energy is spent on image and video production, and in managing their visual libraries across teams and territories.” “We know companies are encountering real friction as they try to cope with the demand for visuals and at the same time, retain transparency, control and visibility of the entire visual content lifecycle. And, while remote working brings many benefits to companies, ours included, creative and operational teams alike are increasingly looking to technology to help them collaborate better, especially when their teams are not physically in the same space. LemonOne brings strength to our foundations in their production capacity, capabilities and the quality of their work.” With this news, the Italian innovators are also able to open up an operational base in Berlin, tapping into the strong German economy and tech ecosystem. Federico added: “We’re also excited to have an operational base in Berlin – a huge ecosystem for business and one that is set to grow even in the current economic climate. Our teams are based across the world and we have customers across three continents – but being able to be physically present in Berlin and use that as a base to expand further across Europe is incredibly valuable.” This new deal, therefore, strengthens BOOM’s presence in Europe, as well as accelerates the delivery of its mission to create a scalable environment that empowers digital companies to effectively manage their full visual content lifecycle, from anywhere in the world. As ecommerce continues to be a massive growth area, and digital businesses increasingly need access to quality visual content, it’s an exciting deal for Europe’s ecosystem. Fritz Oidtmann, Managing Partner at Acton Capital added: “Visual assets are a key driver of online commerce. In the last years, LemonOne’s team has worked tirelessly to provide clients all over Europe with high-quality bespoke visual content. Now, we’re very excited to be joining forces with BOOM as their powerful SaaS platform brings the complete visual assets life cycle to a new level. The combined strengths of the two companies are a big win for all current and future customers.” LemonOne’s clients will join BOOM’s network of customers, which already includes names such as Treatwell and Houzz, on the BOOM Worksite, a centralised platform that enables digital enterprises to organise, share and collaborate on visual assets with internal and third parties. As per the deal, the Italian and German teams will pool together their respective teams, boosting capacity to service a growing customer base and enabling the company to focus on growing its technology and product teams as well as developing the platform even further. In addition, LemonOne’s photographers will join BOOM’s community of visual content creators."
2022.6.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/berlin-based-cara-care-lands-e6-6-million-for-its-digital-digestive-healthcare-app/,"Digestive health issues are an increasingly common struggle for people across the world. It’s something that many silently suffer and don’t receive adequate care for. Cara Care is on a mission to change this – giving everyone access to digestive healthcare via their phones and they’ve just cored €6.6 million. With a commitment to holistic approaches to healthcare, Berlin-based healthtech startup Cara Cara has just raised €6.6 million for its digital digestive care solution. Developed by medical experts, the solution brings together behavioural, microbial and nutritional data. The company are also announcing that James Mapes has been appointed as the new CEO. The funding was led by family-owned international food and nutrition manufacturer Dr. Schär AG, alongside existing investors Sabadell Asabys and Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC, Inc. Founded in 2016, Care Care is a pioneering digital health company that is helping people manage common digestive problems. The solution was developed by physicians and continues to be managed by a team of medical experts, including nutritionists, psychologists, and other specialists. Currently, the main product is the Care Care for IBS app (which can now be prescribed by a doctor) with additional medical devices available for heartburn-related conditions and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis) on the market. The Cara Care app takes a holistic approach, combining innovative research knowledge on gastrointestinal health from clinical practice with technology that makes treatment personalized, motivating, and always available via smartphone. The app analyses individual symptoms to provide tailored therapy aimed at improving quality of life. According to the health tech startup, 73% of users experience a clinically-relevant improvement of symptoms. Concomitant symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, can also be reduced. The therapy was recently approved by the German federal health authority as the first reimbursable prescription digital therapeutic in the gastrointestinal space. With the new capital injection, the Cara Care app’s commercialization will be accelerated across Germany and the US, before further expanding into France and other European markets. The team also plan to broaden the portfolio of digital therapeutics within and beyond gastrointestinal health. Alongside the funding announcement, Cara Care has also just appointed James “Jim” Mapes as new CEO. An experienced healthcare leader, he will join founders Jesaja Brinkmann and Dr. Andre Sommer, and Chief Operating Officer Felix Köhler, in scaling the Cara Care platform. Dr. André Sommer, managing director and co-founder of Cara Care, as well as a medical doctor, commented: “With Jim’s leadership and this new funding, Cara Care is now better positioned than ever before. We are working hard to improve care for millions of people with gastroenterological diseases who have fallen completely through the cracks of our healthcare systems.”"
2022.6.14,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/berlin-based-travel-marketplace-distribusion-raises-e30-million-to-make-it-easier-to-book-transport-online/,"Booking ground transportation can be a complicated process for travellers. To make it simple, by connecting travel brands with transport providers, Distribusion Technologies has just raised €30 million. Travel tech is an incredibly exciting space in 2022. After a couple of years of transport being grounded, this year travel is back and bigger than ever and tech advancements developed over the past couple of years are now coming to fruition. One of the world’s leading ground transportation marketplaces, Distribusion, is certainly getting in on this fast-paced action having just secured €30 million in new funding. The capital boost for the Berlin-based startup was led by Lightrock, with participation from Creandum and Northzone. Founded in 2014, Distribusion is a travel tech platform providing access to different ground transportation options worldwide, empowering travellers with an improved travel experience. The B2B booking platform boasts one of the largest networks of carriers and retailers in the industry, connecting global travel brands with hundreds of bus, airport transfer, train and ferry providers. Today’s ground transportation market is highly fragmented and often subject to bespoke, legacy technology when it comes to supplier schedules and booking systems. It’s meant that planning and booking scheduled journeys online are either not possible or a confusing and time-consuming experience for travellers. As a result, over 100 million ground transportation tickets are purchased offline every day. In today’s digital world, the transportation booking segment is clearly lagging behind. Distribusion’s B2B ground transportation marketplace tackles this issue by providing a vast array of operators from 70+ countries with instant access to its network of travel agents, meta-search websites, and other mobility platforms. Distribusion’s standardisation layer enables online retailers to sell tickets for any operator by connecting to one single API, without any individual contracts or technical effort. Consumers benefit from the resulting ability to compare and purchase tickets on the websites and apps that they know and trust. It’s a win-win situation. The company caught our eye back in 2016 when it picked up €6 million, and since then the team has had an exciting growth journey, including expansion to LATAM in the past two years. Since pre-covid, Distribusion has achieved an impressive 10x growth in passenger numbers and plans to connect 100 million passengers per year by the end of 2024. Not only is Distribuison’s platform good for travellers and travel companies, but it’s also good for the environment. Transportation accounts for nearly 20% of global CO2 emissions. Booking a trip via Distribision naturally substitutes a more pollutive mode of transport such as taxi, private car, or plane and so directly contributes to reducing CO2 emissions from transport. As commented by the CEO, Dr Thomas Doering: “Ground transportation often gets little attention despite having a market size larger than air passenger transport. It is the only accessible long-distance transport option for 2/3 of the world’s population. Yet, access from search to purchase and ticketing is often cumbersome and offline in most cases. With the new funding, we can connect additional carriers and new geographies, digitalizing the experience. We will bring more products to customers’ favourite online channels and help promote the most sustainable mode of transport.” Christopher Steinau, Partner at Lightrock, added: “Distribusion is building the missing part of infrastructure that is crucial to elevate the ground transportation industry. We have been impressed by the unprecedented growth despite the tough headwinds of the global pandemic. Moreover, Distribusion is playing an essential role in driving the adoption of mass ground transportation, one of the most environmentally-friendly forms of transport, and hereby helping to reduce CO2 emissions in travel. We are excited to support the Distribusion team on its global growth ambitions benefitting carriers, retailers, travellers, and the planet.”"
2022.6.14,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/paris-based-startup-granular-picks-up-e2-million-for-its-mission-to-fuel-the-shift-to-clean-energy/,"Facilitating the transition to 24/7 clean energy, Parisian startup Granular has just raised €2 million. The cleantech startup is shaking up how the world buys energy with its hourly energy certificates that give enhanced transparency into where energy is coming from. Across the world, there is an icnreasingly urgent push towards clean energy as the race to achieve net-zero picks up. Carbon-free energy solutions are increasingly sought after, but, until now, transparency on energy availability and use has been a little cloudy. On a mission to instigate a paradigm shift in global energy markets, Granular has now raised €2 million and is ready to launch its hourly energy certificates. VC funds Seedcamp, Revent and Powerhouse Ventures all contributed to the fresh funds. The current system of energy certificates is about 20 years old now, and so it goes without saying it might be time for a review of how things are done. Energy certificates are used to enable informed choices of how to choose one type of electricity over another, but it’s a flawed system. According to Granular, which is led by experienced energy entrepreneurs, under the current framework claims of 100% renewable energy can be made by matching electricity consumption with renewable energy produced at any time within a 12-month window. This fails to reflect the ‘real world’ availability of renewable energy which fluctuates from hour to hour, and effectively means that solar energy can be claimed against consumption during night-time leading to distrust and inefficient price signals. It’s an issue that is presenting a serious obstacle in the transition to clean energy sources. Fixing it could be the key to re-orientating energy markets to decarbonisation. This is what Granular aims to achieve. Founded in 2021, Granular has been developing internationally recognised standards for hourly certificates and is providing SaaS tools to trade and manage time-stamped energy certificates (or ‘hourly energy certificates’) that enable consumers to verify when and where their energy is coming from carbon-free sources. Toby Ferenczi, Granular Energy co-founder and CEO explained: “By establishing a market for hourly energy certificates, Granular is helping to accelerate the shift to a carbon-free grid by harnessing consumer demand to send a razor-sharp price signal that values clean energy according to ‘real-world’ availability. Ultimately, we think that all units of energy could be tagged and traded in this way, bringing a radical new level of transparency to energy markets.” To truly decarbonize the energy supply, there is a fast-growing trend to commit to 24/7 carbon-free energy, meaning that every unit of electricity consumption is met with carbon-free electricity sources, at every hour and at every location, verified by hourly energy certificates. This represents a paradigm shift in the way consumers purchase clean energy and represents a market need for a solution like Granular’s. It’s a shift that calls for an increase in transparency in clean energy and carbon accounting claims, as well as incentivising the deployment of renewable energy, demand-side flexibility, and storage. Being part of this transition brings benefits across sectors, including transport, industry, heating and cooling. Henrik Grosse Hokamp, Partner at Revent said: “Granular’s solution is a paradigm change for the energy market. It will be finally possible for utilities, corporates, and consumers to buy true 100% carbon-free electricity. This is a crucial step and a missing piece to move our society away from carbon-emitting energy production and towards addressing climate change in a meaningful way.” One use case that illustrates the importance of this new approach is the hydrogen industry. On 20th May, the European Commission released for consultation new requirements which include hourly matching between renewable generation and electrolyzer consumption that must be met to qualify as green hydrogen. Granular has developed a specific software solution to help hydrogen producers efficiently meet this requirement and verify that their hydrogen is truly green and is in discussions to trial this in Europe soon. Further, the market for existing clean energy certificates is estimated to be worth about $12 billion and is estimated to grow to $100 billion by 2030 with increasing scrutiny over energy performance. It shows great market potential for the disruptive Paris-based startup. Emily Kirsch, Managing Partner, Powerhouse Ventures said: “To truly decarbonize energy supply, there needs to be a significant shift to hourly clean energy procurement and Granular is well-positioned to provide the tools necessary to manage and scale the emerging 24/7 carbon-free energy market.” The company has already partnered with NordPool, the leading European power market operator, and Elexon, to launch the world’s first market for hourly energy certificates in the UK. Twelve large energy utilities are participating in the first phase of the market launch, alongside a diverse range of large organisations such as Sky and The University of Nottingham who are both demonstrating their sustainability leadership by engaging in the project. Now, with this new funding boost, the startup will roll out its platform in the UK, launch into 3 new European markets and into the US, taking transparent energy certificates to international heights."
2022.6.14,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/amsterdam-based-bits-of-stock-banks-e4-2-million-for-its-stock-reward-platform-addressing-wealth-inequality/,"Taking an innovative approach to addressing wealth inequality that simultaneously builds brand loyalty, Dutch fintech startup Bits of Stock has just picked up about €4.2 million. The idea is that through the ownership economy wealth inequality can be addressed. On a global scale, financial inequality is widening and younger generations are taking the biggest burden of this challenge. On a mission to address wealth inequality through promoting the ownership economy, Amsterdam-based Bits of Stock has just picked up €4.2 million. The funding was led by Keen Venture Partners and Yellow Accelerator by Snap Inc. Founded in 2018, the fintech disruptors have developed a consumer reward platform that drives loyalty for brands, replacing traditional points, loyalty cards, and cashback programs with assets that grow in value over time. It means that everyday choices become wealth-building opportunities. Shoppers simply enrol a credit card in the Bits of Stock app to automatically start earning rewards. Arun Sundararajan, from the NYU Stern School of Business, commented: “Stock rewards are dramatically more effective than cash and points because they’re aligned with economic and purchasing incentives. They have a more visceral, emotive and instinctive appeal as well, creating a deeper brand connection, Bits of Stock is pointing us to the future of loyalty programs.” According to the charity Oxfam, the world’s richest 1% own nearly half of the world’s wealth. Read that again. It’s a shocking statistic that is affecting people, particularly younger generations, on a global scale. Without innovative action, the situation is only going to get worse. Bits of Stock is aiming to reverse this trend by making financial products like fractional shares easily accessible, particularly useful for younger generations who have more difficulties building long-term wealth. The majority of Millennials and Gen Z don’t invest and have fewer savings than older generations. With this funding, the young company is launching a Growth Rewards API, allowing clients to embed a seamless rewards experience into their own applications and choose from thousands of fractional shares and crypto rewards. For brands and retailers, but also neobanks and BNPL providers, the Bits of Stock Growth Rewards API represents a game-changing opportunity – enabling them to boost brand loyalty, by showing shoppers that relationships are more than just transactional. Arash Asady, CEO and co-founder of Bits of Stock, explained: “The Bits of Stock Growth Rewards API will support a range of embedded finance and rewards-as-a-service use case. It is the most significant innovation in customer loyalty programs since they began, more than two centuries ago.” The fintech firm is currently working with 60 brands, including Adidas, KFC, Nike and Zara, and, they also have subscription brands such as Uber, Spotify and Netlfix active on the platform. This new finding will give the team a competitive edge in the embedded finance industry. It’ll be used to double the team size and onboard more than 200 brands in the next 12 months. Arash added: “The funding will help us to scale up our mission of building the “Ownership Economy” for the thousands of brands and their tens of millions of end consumers. Our ultimate purpose is to address wealth inequality and help young people learn about finance and investing.”"

More and more companies are adopting digital coaching at scale and it’s predicted to be a segment with massive growth in the next couple of years. Harold Boël, CEO, Sofina, added: “We believe 1:1 coaching will continue to be one of the most effective ways of enhancing the socio-emotional and leadership skills needed to thrive in an increasingly complex and rapidly evolving workplace. As a company that seeks to democratise access to quality coaching, CoachHub’s mission resonates with our Responsible Investment strategy. We look forward to partnering with them to further their global ambitions.” CoachHub has already been noted as a super fast-growing startup. We put it on our list of the most disruptive edtech startups back in 2021, as well as our list of German startups to watch. The firm also acquired French digital coaching pioneer MoovOne in 2021 before then snapping up the coaching division of Klaiton in Austria in 2022 in order to build a global champion focused on democratising coaching. Yanni Pipilis, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers said: “The Learning and Development sector is witnessing strong secular trends toward the digitisation and personalisation of services. CoachHub’s digital platform aims to provide a tailored coaching experience to employees at all levels to help advance their careers. We are pleased to partner with Yannis and the CoachHub team to support their mission of democratising coaching.” This latest round of funding will fuel further expansion within Europe, with plans to increase its headcount from 850 worldwide employees to more than 1,000 by the end of the year. The company already serves more than 500 customers, with leading household names like Coca-Cola, Danone, Toyota, LVMH, L’Oréal, Credit Suisse and Twitter as clients. It’s certainly going to be exciting to see what happens next!"
2022.6.14,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/amsterdam-based-testgorilla-raises-over-e66-million-for-its-pioneering-tech-making-recruitment-fairer/,"On a mission to make hiring bias a thing of the past, Dutch startup TestGorilla has just secured over €66 million for its pioneering platform that is revolutionizing recruitment processes. Hiring and getting hired are both complicated processes. For HR teams, the process can be time-consuming and is too often reliant on inefficient systems. For the candidate, the process can be unfair and often discriminatory. On a mission to disrupt the status quo with a pioneering platform, TestGorilla has just secured over €66 million in fresh funding. The investment was co-led by the London-based venture capital firms Atomico and Balderton Capital. It joins previous funding from Notion, Partech, and CapitalT. Luca Eisenstecken from Atomico and James Wise from Balderton Capital will join the board as part of this investment round. Founded in 2020 by serial entrepreneur Wouter Durville and former Bain & Company partner Otto Verhage, TestGorilla makes the recruitment process more fair, efficient, and data-driven. It enables organizations to use skills assessments as soon as candidates apply for open roles – meaning recruiters can narrow down candidates based on their capabilities, not a subjective opinion or antiquated CV. It also makes the process much faster – removing the need to read hundreds of application forms. TestGorilla featured on our list of Dutch startups to watch this year, catching our eye for its revolutionary recruitment tech. TestGorilla’s co-founder Wouter Durville, explained: “Too often, the recruitment process requires hiring managers to spend hours screening unreliable, incomplete, subjective CVs. By replacing resumes with more than 220 scientifically validated tests, our platform helps to eliminate hiring bias, creating a level playing field where every candidate can compete on equal terms.” Hiring and recruitment are going through a major shake-up at the minute. Europe’s economy has changed massively over the past few years, new roles have opened up and skills shortages have left big gaps. It’s left the job market more competitive than ever and something needs to be done to ensure that quality candidates aren’t left by the wayside. Tech is helping to ensure that people find and are hired in the roles they deserve and to ensure that companies arent wasting their time with inefficient processes and poor hiring choices. TestGorilla is leading the way in skills-based hiring – an increasingly popular way to recruit that gives every candidate an equal chance to prove their abilities and motivation. Adopting skills-based hiring helps businesses recruit top talent and more diverse candidates, faster, easier and with less risk of bias. Studies show that job success is most strongly correlated with multi-measure assessments, whereas CVs and work experience are the weakest links. The TestGorilla platform caters to this by offering organizations hundreds of pre-employment tests that enable them to tailor their candidate search to their exact requirements. Areas covered by the assessments range from quantitative skills to cognitive ability, enabling prospective employees to compete on merit rather than background. It gives insights into areas such as specific role-related skills, language proficiency, cognitive abilities, soft skills, personality, motivation and culture add – all contributing to greater success for both candidates and companies. Atomico’s partner Luca Eisenstecken added: “Finding the right people is increasingly challenging for even the world’s best brands, and the pandemic has opened employer eyes to huge untapped pools of global talent. TestGorilla is seeing incredible growth with its automated, data-driven approach to solving this problem. And they’re doing this while delivering a fairer hiring process based on skills rather than resumes, eliminating the biases that prejudice decision making.” In just a short time since its launch, TestGorilla has been growing at an incredible space. It’s attracted more than 5,000 customers with household names such as Sony, PepsiCo, Bain & Company, Oracle, Revolut, H&M and the UK’s National Health Service trusting the platform. In addition, G2, the world’s largest software marketplace, recently named TestGorilla in its prestigious list of the top five fastest-growing software products for 2022. Laurens-Jan Olsthoorn, a partner at Bain & Company, a client of TestGorilla, has commented that: “Using TestGorilla as a screening tool has helped us to replace the bottom 30% of applicants with better-qualified candidates, improving the success rate of our subsequent rounds. We have seen a strong correlation between candidates’ performance in TestGorilla assessments and in the interview process, so we trust TestGorilla to make a great first cut from a large number of candidates. I would happily recommend TestGorilla to my industry peers.” TestGorilla’s remote team serves recruiters, HR professionals, hiring managers, and hiring teams in more than 100 countries. Now, with this fresh funding, the plan is to keep scaling and growing this revolutionary approach to recruitment. The ongoing development of TestGorilla’s proprietary technology will include the platform’s integration with further Applicant Tracking Systems, enabling employers to use the product seamlessly from within their existing ATS, and the introduction of new features to satisfy the requirements of mid-sized businesses. The platform’s test library continues to expand, with the existing 220-plus tests due to be joined by a further 100 by the end of 2022. The company also expects to hire 100 new employees in the coming year. James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital, also said: “We’ve already seen TestGorilla become wildly popular within our portfolio as a more effective and fair way to identify people with the right skills for the role, and we’re excited to support the team on their mission to end the era of CV-based candidate screening.”"

Building a decentralized NFT infrastructure to facilitate this, Estonian startup NFTPort has just picked up over €24.9 million. For the past year, the term NFT has well and truly entered the European lexicon. It’s one of the hottest phenomenons in Europe’s tech space at the moment with little sign that it’s going to cool down soon. Aiming to develop infrastructure that will underpin the NFT market, Tallinn-based NFTPort has just closed its Series A funding at €24.9 million. The investment was co-led by Taavet+Sten, the investment vehicle of Taavet Hinrikus and Sten Tamkivi, and Atomico. Additional investors include Filecoin creator Protocol Labs, Sparkle Ventures, IDEO CoLab Ventures, Polygon co-founder Jaynti Kanani, former Twilio CTO, Ott Kaukver, former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, and Polkadot co-founder Jutta Steiner, and many other founders. Early use cases for NFTs increased in popularity in 2021 as consumers experienced the emergence of nascent forms of digital ownership in the sports, art, and fashion industries. Now, in 2022 and looking to the future, it’s clear there is scope for more in this area. Acting as a ‘wrapper’ for any form of data, NFTs enable digital ownership by transferring data from the hands of large data monopolies to the hands of individual users. Founded in 2021 by Johannes Tammekänd and Kaspar Peterson, NFTPort wants to lay the infrastructure that will underpin this change – and want to do so in a way that enables developers to make the internet ownable by regular people through decentralization. As explained by CEO and co-founder Johannes Tammekänd: “When a company decides to build their NFT infrastructure today, it would either have to expend significant sums of money for scarce web3 developers, or invest time upskilling a web2 developer to carry out the work. Managing constantly evolving blockchain technology quickly becomes a multi-million dollar problem for most companies wishing to build their own NFT infrastructure; like accepting payments online pre-Stripe or building a tech-based product pre-cloud.” “Demand will only increase further as NFTs move beyond images, which will compound pre-existing supply-side issues. Our infrastructure enables developers and companies to bring to market their NFT applications in hours or days, instead of months and thus save hundreds of thousands of dollars.” The NFT space is still new and complex to digest, so let’s break this down further. NFTPort provides access to the three key pillars which most companies need in order to build NFT products: data APIs, minting APIs and user safety APIs. Data APIs provide access to all NFT data from Ethereum, Polygon and Solana so developers can get up and running. Minting APIs allows developers to deploy, manage and customize fully owned NFT smart contracts without having to write a line of smart contract code or know the complex Web3 stack. This enables millions of Web2 developers who know REST APIs to turn digital assets into NFTs in their applications. And with regards to user safety APIs, NFTPort has built a counterfeit detection engine for developers to cross-check if a given NFT has been previously minted on any of its supported chains. Therefore, the NFT innovators are providing a full-stack experience for developers and companies. It means that developers can bring their NFT applications to market in hours rather than months, decentralizing access to the NFT space. Taavet+Sten Partner and NFTPort co-founder Sten Tamkivi commented: “I’ve always liked the crispness of definition for web3, the next generation of internet: users can read, write and own information. But it is one thing to talk about vision, and another to build real tools and applications. NFTPort’s role is to add meat to these bones, to build the scaffolding in the form of APIs and decentralized protocols for developers to be able to deliver on the promise of a citizen owned internet.” Already, the solution is used by over 30k developer teams, including by some of the biggest names in the Web3 world, cush as Nifty Gateway and Protocol Labs. Further, as of March 2022, developers through NFTPort had minted over a million NFTs on Polygon – 10% of all NFTs minted on the Polygon chain. This new funding boost will enable the team to double down on scaling the core product and bring a decentralized NFT infrastructure protocol to market. It’ll also help fuel the development of its infrastructure offer and empower the next phase of digital ownership. Atomico Partner Irina Haivas added: “We have high conviction in a shift towards increased digital ownership powered by NFT technology, and the potential for NFTs to become a new asset class. However, a lot of the infrastructure required to underpin the widespread adoption of NFTs and other web3 technologies still needs to be built, and this is where NFTPort comes in.”"

Today, Vienna-based tubics has scored a fresh investment to expand its SaaS produce changing how video marketing works. The startup, founded in 2017, is building a cloud-based solution that makes video marketing based on greater data insights – helping companies to amplify their brand via video. The funding saw participation from Wayra Germany, SaaS Entrepreneur Alexander Kirchgasser and Ralph Harreiter. Although regarded as one of the more powerful tools in the marketers’ toolkit, video content is still largely based on gut feeling and conviction. A lack of true data insight has meant that video content often ends up being a waste of resources and audiences are left disappointed. The fact is, enterprises and brands tend to have a clear idea of what they want to include in their video content strategy, but the execution is lacking as they struggle to find what audiences are genuinely interested in. According to tubics, 88% of people got convinced to buy a product by watching a brand’s video or 96% of people watched a video to learn about a product. Clearly, it’s a powerful resource for marketing teams. The Viennese startup has built an enterprise-ready SaaS platform that learns from the viewing behaviour of the masses who cumulatively watch millions of hours of YouTUbe videos every day. A powerful recommendation engine then covers the four crucial steps of data-driven video marketing: ideation, video briefings, optimization, and, reporting. For companies, this means they are empowered to build video production on a transparent and collaborative process that leads to enriched, data-backed recommendations. Ultimately, it provides a better foundation for leading-edge creativity and resonating content that maximizes on organic views and watch time. Dieter Rappold, serial entrepreneur and tubics CEO explained: “Our solution compounds everyday and we can track and see the performance our customers achieve with the tubics platform – not only with new Video Content being created but also with legacy Video Content being SEO optimized with tubics. We strongly believe that our data-driven approach to Video Marketing and the strong Video SEO capabilities position tubics as a future leading MarTech Startup that will change Online Video as we know it.” So far, the startup has seen more than 170k YouTube channels connect to tubics to leverage better insights on their video content, among them, are leading brands such as Amazon Prime, Henkel, Nestlé, BitPanda, Lancome, Biotherm, L’Oréal, Samsung, Tommy Hilfiger and many more. This new funding will be used to further develop the product as well as to scale sales and marketing efforts."

There’s no doubt the year started off strong with big funding rounds and big announcements coming off the back of a year that saw the most funding in Europe ever. But, there’s since been some anxiety and uncertainty within the VC space. Marking its commitment to Europe’s startup ecosystem, 3VC has just launched its second fund at a total worth of €150 million. Based in Vienna, 3VC is a European-focused VC group investing in carefully handpicked tech startups with global ambitions. The fund, earmarked for Series A companies, reflects the matured need and ability to deploy capital by these businesses, as well as the determination of 3VC to support portfolio companies long-term. Founded by General Partners Roman Scharf and Peter Lasinger in 2017, the firm has a high-conversion investment strategy that they are reaffirming a commitment to. It involves a priority of quality over quantity, making 3-4 investments per year into companies that are solving massive and pertinent proves through software, regardless of the industry or business model (B2B, B2C). With this fund, 3VC will continue to build a portfolio of healthily valued companies with strong and sustainable growth—a strategy that is yet again proving to be successful with the easy money era coming to an end and markets going back to normal. As with previous investments, 3VC supports companies starting at the Series A stage and in strong consortiums alongside other top VCs. Currently, the company counts 3 portfolio companies that have turned into unicorns. This includes Picsart, the all-in-one photo & video editing app with over 1 billion downloads, DeepCode (now part of Snyk), a cloud-native application security provider that enables millions of developers to build software securely, and, Gamee (now part of ANimoca Brands), the market leader in Web 3, NFT, and blockchain-enabled metaverses. The portfolio also includes several notable soonicorns, including Lokalise, Kaia Health, Storyblok, Avi Medical, and Tatum. It’s a firm that has been committed to promoting diversity and sustainability – promoting global change through innovation but also through business approach and strategy. And it’s doing so whilst promoting CEE as a big growth market for globally-minded companies. The team counts regional backgrounds in Austria, Cambodia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Italy, Latvia, Romania, and Hungary and professional backgrounds in branding, design, finance, product, sales, and tech. 3VC has 50:50 gender diversity both on the Partner level as well as in the investment team. In 2017, 3VC made its first hire, Eva Arh. Now, alongside this funding, Eva and Sok-Kheng Taing have been named as Partners in the firm. Eva Arh, Partner at 3VC, commented: “It was a unique opportunity back in 2017 to join 3VC in its formation stage when CEE as a region was still under the radar. We have evolved as a team, and it has been very rewarding to work with Peter and Roman who are so complementary to each other. My motivation has always been to be a (small) puzzle piece in the success of companies that come out of the region and strive for winning globally. Partnering with the Lokalise team was very special to me since they started in Latvia, where I come from, and their success is and will have an impact on the whole ecosystem in Latvia. I am very excited to further double down on those down to earth yet ambitious teams rooted in CEE and DACH.” Sok-Kheng Taing, Partner at 3VC, said: “I was a limited partner in 3VC’s first fund as well as the chairwoman of the investment committee. Through this early engagement, I realised how keen 3VC is to support scalable European startups and invest in ambitious teams with excellent execution. When Peter and Roman asked me to join as a Partner going forward, it was clear to me that I very much wanted to be part of this journey and scale. It was the unique investment approach, the entrepreneurial personality, and the technological knowledge of the 3VC team that convinced me to join.”"
2022.6.15,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/paris-based-rayon-draws-up-plans-to-expand-its-collaborative-design-software-with-fresh-e1-9-million/,"Developing the next-generation tool for collaborative design in the built environment, Paris-based startup Rayon has just announced a raise of more than €1.9 million Design work, particularly for the built environment is inherently a collaborative process. It requires a holistic approach, sharing of ideas and multidisciplinary input. With the aim to make software that facilitates more collaboration for space designers, Rayon has picked up about €1.9 million in a pre-seed funding round. The investment was led by Seedcamp alongside Foundamental, 20VC and Kima. They are also joined by a cohort of business angels including, Ralph Gootee, co-founder of plangrid (acquired by Autodesk); Joe Thomas co-founder and CEO of Loom; Thibaud Elziere and Quentin Nickmans founders of eFounders; Nicolas Steegmann co-founder of Stupeflix; Riggs Kubiak founder of Honest buildings (acquired by Procore); Jonathan Widawski founder & CEO of Maze, as well as many others. Whilst design is fundamentally collaborative, existing software is not. The tools currently on the market are expensive, heavy and overly complex, and because they mainly work with proprietary files saved offline on your local desktop computer, they represent a barrier to teamwork. As a result, the professionals who design and run our built environment still wrestle with software from the pre-internet era. Urgent digitalisation is needed to keep up with growing design demands, and Rayon is aiming to fill this market need. Bastien Dolla, co-founder at Rayon said: “There are more than 30 million people working on floor plans every day. Currently, most of them are stuck with static pdf files that they cannot edit, measure and or update in real time. We believe we can do much better than that! Our goal is for Rayon to become the fastest and simplest way to work on floor plans as a team”. Founded in 2021 by Bastien Dolla and Stanislas Chaillou, Rayon’s tech solution is built on deep experience in browser-based technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Real Estate, and Architecture. The company provides online design software that allows users anywhere to draw, share and work together on floor plans directly in their browser. This supports the way that space design increasingly functions: in teams, at a fast pace, and in constant dialogue with other disciplines and expertise. By speeding up the design phase, gathering teams around a single source of truth, and replacing time-consuming cross-platform workflows, current users have experienced working up to three times faster than previously. Stanislas Chaillou, co-founder at Rayon added: ”Rayon places today a bet: building the next generation of space design platform. Laying out today the foundation for an online ecosystem is to us the stepping towards offering tomorrow the best technology can offer to our industry (API integrations, smart drawing tools, community-curated content, and more)”. The French startup’s tool is able to be deployed across diverse use cases, including commercial real estate, housing, interior space planning, furniture manufacturing, asset management, and so on –  demonstrating that user-friendly, collaborative and fast space design tools are a dire need for a broad crowd of individuals across our industry and beyond. Tom Wilson, Partner at Seedcamp commented: “Space Design is fundamentally collaborative, but the current CAD software offering is not: these tools are not only expensive, heavy and too complex, but they also represent a barrier to teamwork in this industry.” This pre-seed investment will be used to fuel the growth of the team, refine the product offering and prepare the startup to launch in October 2022."

The stock photo industry is reportedly worth about $5 billion every year and JumpStory is disrupting the market. New investors include Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson, who is also the co-founder of Basecamp, and Joergen Bardenfleth – former Scandinavian CEO at Microsoft. Founded in 2018 by Jonathan Low and Anders Thiim, JumpStory has developed a platform that is taking on the likes of Getty Images and Shutterstock. It is doing so by prioritizing authentic and high-performing images and developing the business model in a way that’s similar to Netflix. Jonathan Low commented: “We’re super proud and excited that David has decided to jump on board. We want to change the world of stock photos and make it much more simple, transparent and authentic. The stock photo industry is turning over $5 billion a year, but at the same time, we feel so much is wrong with the industry, as it is. For example, all the cheesy stock images; the complex licensing terms and the high prices.” The startup has simplified pricing and licensing to offer a subscription offering, similar to that of the popular streaming service. It’s offering one simple license and unlimited downloads for a fixed monthly price – a game-changer for anyone involved in content. Prices are under €30 per month and allow for unlimited downloads of millions of curated and authentic stock photos, videos, icons and AI tools. Reporting a yearly growth rate of 230%, JumpStory has had an exciting journey in its shake-up of an industry that was getting a little stagnant. The company now has customers using the platform from around the world, including the likes of APSIS, SEMrush and Computerworld. Further, the startup’s team is made up of members from 8 different countries. This new funding will fuel the company’s growth. Anders Thiim explained: “Currently the US, Canada, Australia and the UK are our biggest markets. However, from the beginning, Jonathan and I decided that we wanted to grow the company from our HQ in Denmark. We believe that local ecosystems are hugely important because as entrepreneurs we want to give back to the communities that we grew out of. We have no plans to move to Silicon Valley”."

The solution enables, for the first time, full-body live capture, rendering, and streaming of multiple holograms in real-time. While we all know by now that the digital future is 3D, thanks to innovation in areas like the metaverse, NFTs and VR, Swiss startup Imverse is bringing the 3D digital future in real-time. The team has just picked up €4.6 million for its proprietary tech. The funding round was led by Ariel Luedi’s Hammer Team, including participation from HTC and Logitech. Founded in 2017 by Javier Bello Ruiz, the company’s CEO, and Robin Mange, CTO, Imverse has developed a proprietary voxel (volumetric pixel) graphics engine capable of live capture, rendering and streaming of multiple holograms in real-time. This tech is capable of creating full-body volumetric humans without industrial cameras or powerful computing equipment at the fraction of the cost of existing solutions, and with low latency. As a result, the delivery of volumetric content at the same rate as mainstream video conferencing tech (such as Teams or Zoom), has been made possible. It’s a technology that has a host of use cases, including virtual teleconferencing, immersive education, healthcare, gaming and the Metaverse. Javier Bello Ruiz, co-founder and CEO of Imverse, explained: “For the Metaverse to become a reality we need to overcome a lot of technical hurdles. One of the biggest challenges is making producing 3D content affordable and accessible to everyday consumers and businesses. This is why we believe our voxel breakthrough is so significant. It opens the door to a huge range of new applications, including, for the first time, multiple holograms streaming in real-time. All people need is a few Kinect cameras and a PC and our technology does the rest. Imverse Holo enables creators and businesses to set up multi-camera systems for live volumetric video capture with no need for green screens or cloud services. Its key features include 3D videoconferencing, holoportation and holographic calls. Holoportation allows remote virtual work, collaboration and real-time interactive 3D content creation and consumption – making this a game-changing tech in the era of remote and hybrid work. It also enables producers and consumers to edit, interact, and manipulate content in real-time. This is the foundation of highly personalised virtual experiences where people can control nearly every aspect of the content they consume. In the past year, the team has secured a number of partnerships with some of the world’s largest technology companies and expanded its operations to France. This new funding will now be used to develop the platform and expand the team with the goal of taking the products globally. Ariel Luedi, Founder of Hammer Team, said: “What Imverse has achieved so far is nothing short of phenomenal. My team and I are excited to offer our experience and support the company along their journey in turning this gem of a technology into a game-changing pr"

The startup’s product is enabling financial companies to offer their end customers the full spectrum of investment opportunities, from EFTs and crypto to fractional investing, opening up the investment space. Having built a pioneering end-to-end cloud-native core banking system for investments, the Berlin-based startup Upvest is shaking up the investment space for financial companies. The startup just banked €40 million in a round led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Earlybird and ABN AMRO Ventures have doubled down their commitment to the German fintech as previous investors, with the participation of Notion Capital, Partech, 10x Group, Speedinvest and Maximilian Tayenthal (N26) as well. Already up and running in the market, Upvest enables fintechs to offer their end customers products in the field of capital market investments, from ETFs and stocks to crypto assets. It’s one of the few financial institutions in Europe owning all BaFin licenses for securities and crypto brokerage, and custody. Designed as a plug-and-play solution with fully-fledged process automation at its core, Upvest’s API and core banking system help neobanks – and brokers – as well as established banking players, to significantly save on costs. It enables them to offer investment choices without having to develop their own brokerage and custody infrastructure from scratch. The platform is also fully automated, so easier and cheaper to automate. The flexibility and openness of the investment API fives businesses the maximum freedom to tailor it to their individual needs, reducing the time to onboard new customers and making investing possible immediately. Martin Kassing, founder and CEO of Upvest, explained: “With Upvest, we want to establish Investment-as-a-Service as a new category and become the technical backbone for all fintechs, banks and asset managers that want to offer their end customers safe, affordable and simple access to the capital and crypto market. Since our recent go-live, our API is fully up and running – offering investment products across Europe has never been easier.” With Upvest’s Investment-API, any company that wants to offer investment products has access to endless growth possibilities due to a variety of use cases ranging from crypto trading to fractional investing. Further, the startup has entered into partnerships with renowned bankng players, giving trust to its product. For example, in the area of payment rails and transaction banking, Upvest announced its cooperation with the Dutch banking group ABN AMRO, one of the leading banking groups in Europe. Charles Birnbaum, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, commented: “Upvest is ideally positioned with a market-leading product in one of the most exciting and underserved areas of fintech infrastructure. Just one of Upvest’s USPs: the Investment-API can be easily connected to existing backends and can be immediately deployed, enabling businesses to build great investment experiences for their end users – seamless, secure and across international borders.” The new capital will be used to advance Upvest’s Investment-API, lay the ground for the internationalization, and gradually expand Upvest’s team, which currently counts 90 people in its main berlin hub. Charles Birnbaum added: “With Upvest, both fintech providers and legacy players can set full focus on their core business by developing new investment use cases for their end customers while at the same time exploring new growth opportunities for their own business – a game changer in the European market. We are looking forward to supporting Martin and the entire Upvest team on their ambitious growth journey.”"

With the rise of remote and hybrid working firmly here to stay, there are few employees out there who haven’t been part of a virtual meeting. However, until now, missing these meetings has been a bit of a headache for employees wanting to stay in the loop. To address this, with innovative software any company can benefit from, German startup tl;dv has just secured €4.3 million. The seed funding was led by K Fund with participation from existing investors Seedcamp, Mustard Seed Maze, and another.vc. The round is also joined by Shilling.vc, as well as other European founders and business angels, such as Oscar Pierre, co-founder and CEO of Glovo. The demand for solutions to efficiently record meetings and share them with the wider team and company has soared since the beginning of the pandemic. Making this style of working remain as collaborative as possible is a key mission that is fueling new innovations and concepts in the future of the workspace. Founded in 2020, tl;dv not only makes it easy to record meetings so employees can stay up to date even if they can’t attend, but it goes one step further. The software also transcribes and highlights important moments from the meeting – meaning catching up can just take a few minutes, maximising team efficiency and collaboration. tl;dv positions itself as a horizontal product that adds value to every function and department within a company. Thanks to its simplicity and laser focus on seamless collaboration, it aims to bring departments closer together, with fewer meetings. Co-founder and CEO, Raphael Allstadt, explained: “Imagine giving new hires access to the Strategy Update from last month, even if they weren’t yet part of the company at that moment. Imagine being able to amplify the Voice of the Customer far beyond your User Research or Customer Success team, directly to the Executives of your company, or the engineer that is actually building the solution. Imagine sharing the interview of a promising new candidate with the hiring manager without asking anyone to jump to another meeting. The possibilities and efficiencies thanks to tl;dv are endless.” Adding to the power of collaboration, the tl;dv solution has integration with popular productivity tools such as Slack and Notion, as well as with CRMs such as Hubspot and Pipedrive. An additional element to the tool is ‘discoverability’ – fueled by a powerful search engine that allows users to find any spoken word from any meeting. Jaime Novoa at K Fund added: “For a long time at K Fund, we’d been recording some of our internal meetings so that they could be consumed at a later time by those not able to attend. This exploded with the pandemic and hybrid forms of work. tl;dv brings this to another level and we’re obviously heavy users at the firm. It’s not only about the pure aspect of recording calls, but also about the way it integrates with other productivity tools such as Calendar, Notion, Google Docs, etc so that it becomes an essential part of the way we work”. Already working with more than 200k users at companies like Genies, Vaynermedia, Byju’s and Superside, with the financing, tl;dv will double down on bundling live meeting insights across various meetings providers, adding Zoom to their already existing integration with Google Meet."

The startup combines components from social networks and soccer platforms from the professional sector. It essentially allows every active soccer player to follow themself and their friends/teammates – just like they follow Ronaldo and Messi. “A new generation of soccer players and fans is currently growing up. The commercialization of professional soccer is having an impact. We see that ‘real soccer’ will rapidly gain in importance due to this trend and advancing digitization.” Already available for both Apple and Android users, Prematch now includes data on over 2 million players. The new funding will be used to continue developing the platform and to expand it across Germany, one of Europe’s footballing hubs. The startup also wants to grow the team to facilitate these plans. Ralf Reichert commented: “The future of modern soccer is gamified and hyper-personalized. There is incredible potential in the amateur sector.” Jörg Kattner added: “Through my active time in amateur sports, I know the challenges of the clubs and am excited about the new possibilities through Prematch.”"

Founder, Tomáš Čupr, commented: “Series D in this tough market is a great achievement for Rohlik and the entire team. Without our great people, we wouldn’t be in this position. This raise gives us a chance to emerge as a category winner in the next few years and I am excited about what lies ahead.” Founded in 2014 with the vision to raise the bar in terms of food quality and service in the grocery delivery service, Rohlik delivers groceries straight to consumers’ doorsteps in a 15-minute window. What makes it so popular is the delicate and unique combination of fast and precise delivery, large assortment and choice, and, great value for money for consumers. The company claims to deliver 85% of orders within 90 minutes from order or within 15- minute same-day time windows. It has a reported 17k items in its assortment and prices are in line with competitors. The e-grocer solution combines well-priced private brands, locally sourced goods from small farmers and producers and top international brands – giving consumers amazing choices. Already operating in Prague, Budapest, Vienna, Munich and Frankfurt, the Czech company now has its eyes set on further expansion. Hamburg, Milan, Bucharest and Madrid are the next cities to host the e-grocer service. Currently, over 1 million active customers use the service to get their groceries delivered and this is only set to skyrocket with these new launches and this new funding round. The new funds will also be used to accelerate tech innovation, including the automation of fulfilment centres and electric mobility. Sofina’s CEO Harold Boël, added: “This investment fits with Sofina’s strategy in the Consumer and Retail sector of providing capital to support growth opportunities alongside partners sharing common values and a vision to bring efficiency, choice and convenience of food retail to new levels. “This investment fits with Sofina’s strategy in the Consumer and Retail sector of providing capital to support growth opportunities alongside partners sharing common values and a vision to bring efficiency, choice and convenience of food retail to new levels.”"

2022.6.17,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/spanish-startup-photoslurp-has-merged-with-flowbox-to-become-the-european-leader-in-social-media-marketing/,"A new European giant has arrived in the social media marketing world and it has come via a merger between Photoslurp and Flowbox. The agreement will see the two companies join forces under the name Flowbox. For marketing teams, leveraging social media is a fundamental approach to connect and engage with customers, and, consequently, drive revenues. Two platforms that have been enabling companies in Europe to leverage customers’ social media accounts and interactions, Photoslurp and Flowbox, have now merged to lead the sector. Social media is giving marketing teams endless possibilities to drive conversions, clicks and revenues. It can be used to grow communities, create hype around a product, and sell. This merger, therefore, represents a big move in the sector, putting the new Flowbox as an undisputed European giant. CEO of Photoslurp and future Chief Revenue Officer at Flowbox, Eulogi Bordas Casas, commented: “There are great similarities between Flowbox and Photoslurp, both technically, commercially, and culturally. By merging, we create synergy effects that lay the foundation for continued strong growth, not only in Europe but globally.” Founded in Barcelona in 2015, Photoslurp’s visual commerce platform allows brands to use User Generated Content (UGC) created by their fans and customers. The pioneering platform scans social media for photos and videos of customers with a brand’s products and then integrates them into the brand’s store, making them ‘shoppable’. It leads to more engagement between consumers and companies and also drives conversion rates. In 2017, we reported the team’s €750k raise. Some of Photoslurp’s customers are United Colors of Benetton, KARL LAGERFELD, and Havaianas. Flowbox, a startup with roots in Stockholm, offers a visual marketing platform that allows brands to leverage and distribute social content throughout the buyer journey – increasing engagement, social proof and sales. Like Photoslurp, it enables brands to collect, moderate and integrate content onto their websites, online shops and social channels. It was founded in 2016, and, in 2020 we reckoned it was a startup to keep an eye on after it raised €7.5 million (prior to this it was bootstrapped) and set its sights on expansion. Marcus Carloni, CEO of Flowbox, said: “Photoslurp is a very good match for us. They are a major player in Europe but also in South America, which complements our previous customer base well. South America will actually be a completely new market for us. The company has also developed a similar platform, which makes the integration work smooth. We are now migrating their more than 300 customers, which gives us a total customer base of over 850 customers in 40 countries.” Together with this merger, the company will grow to a total of 70 employees distributed across Stockholm, Amsterdam and Barcelona – hitting important hubs of growth and innovation in the continent. Eivind Bergsmyr, Partner at Viking Venture and Chairman of the board at Flowbox, added: “Demand for marketing platforms like this continues to increase and this is reflected in Flowbox’s topline growth. Through the strategic merger with Photoslurp, we will continue this journey and expand to new geographies as well as product areas."
2022.6.17,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/danish-startup-fellow-pay-picks-up-e325k-to-make-sure-europes-smes-get-paid-on-time/,"With a disruptive payment solution that is making sure SMEs get paid fairly and on time for their services and products, Aarhus-based Fellow Pay has just scored €325k in new funding, bringing the total raised to €2.5 million. While there has been a lot of activity in the SME payment space, most of the action has focused on making payments more seamless for customers. Taking a different approach, Danish startup Fellow Pay is here to help ensure that SMEs get paid on time and in fair terms. The company has just raised an additional €325k bringing its total pre-seed funding to €2.5 million. Founded by Christian Thisted and Jacob Pedersen in 2017, Fellow Pay was launched to address a growing problem – that SMEs too often struggle financially, or even close down, because of unfair payment terms from customers. SMEs should be able to take greater control over payments and retain more fluidity. Christian Thisted explained: “We’re passionate about helping these companies that otherwise would not have access to financing and that do not want to use the traditional, unfair alternatives that already exist. This is what drives us.” The problem the team want to solve is rooted in an imbalanced payment culture whereby companies demand up to 90 days’ payment deadlines when they buy services or products from other, often smaller, companies. This leaves a lot of SMEs in a position where they – unnecessarily – have to wait for a long time to get their payment and therefore are unable to grow as fast as they could and should. In the worst cases, these payment terms can even force companies to shut down. So, to disrupt the market on the side of Europe’s SMEs, the Danish fintech has developed a fair, easy and innovative product that ensures any small business – regardless of its size – can get its invoice paid on the same day it is issued. Christian added: “With the traction and the customer satisfaction we’re experiencing right now, it’s becoming more and more clear to us how big the need for our solution is. And when we combine that with the fact that we’re able to operate in 46 countries across borders, it’s hard not to dream big. We want to be the go-to place for companies all over the world when it comes to instant payments.” Currently operating in 9 countries, the startup has already achieved notable attention for its solution. In 2020 it won Finance Forward, a fintech competition hosted by Village capital, MetLife Foundation and PayPal. Putting this new funding to use, the team plans to expand further into new markets and grow the product to help SMEs across Europe make fairer payment terms."

2022.6.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/french-healthtech-startup-axomove-raises-e1-6-million-to-bring-digital-solutions-to-physiotherapy/,"Aiming to empower remote patient engagement in physiotherapy, French startup Axomove has raised €1.6 million for its digital health platform. The company is enabling better patient follow-up and compliance with self-rehabilitation exercises. Innovation in healthcare is continuing to be a growth area, and one key pattern is the development of digital health solutions that make managing health easier for both doctors and patients. Bringing digital solutions to physiotherapy treatments, French startup Axomove has just raised €1.6 million. The funding was led by Spanish fund Faraday Venture Partners, homecare group Santélys and Groupe JLO, a company that specializes in health and quality working environment. Founded in 2017 by Pierre-Yves Carlier, a physiotherapist, and Boris Leveque, a former professional handball player, Axomove was created with the vision to reimagine physiotherapy and rehabilitation. The goal is to improve patient follow-up and compliance with self-rehab exercises through adopting digital technology. The company has developed a remote physical therapy solution that boosts remote patent engagement and is available for hospitals, rehab centres, and insurance companies. It enables doctors to ensure that their patients are following treatment correctly to avoid relapses and the deterioration of their condition, without the need for them to travel to the centre on a regular basis – improving time efficiency. For companies, it helps employees with musculoskeletal disorders reduce physical pain through therapeutic movements, offering preventative care solutions. With this new funding, the startup will roll out its e-health solution on a large scale to its main target customers. Priorities also include strengthening the sales team, enhancing investments in the medico-economic evaluation and reinforcing the therapeutic education content. The company will also continue its R&D efforts to develop new functionalities for patients and practitioners with motion capture technology. François Xavier Fanard, Managing Director of Faraday Venture Partners, said: “From the very first discussions, we were charmed by Axomove’s approach to tackling musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Indeed, their digital solution, combined with telehealth consultations, is an effective response to the needs of patients in rehabilitation as well as a tool that allows employees to prevent any risk of MSDs with ease. The quality of Axomove’s solution, the professionalism and attentiveness of the team, and their desire to help promote well-being and healthy living for all are some of the arguments that convinced us to support Axomove in its growth.” Clément Morel, President and co-founder of Axomove, added: “We are delighted to have brought around the same table very complementary investors; on one hand a financial fund of European dimension and, on the other hand, two corporate funds totally aligned with our ambitions in the field of prevention and physical health rehabilitation. In addition to their financial support, this combination of expertise will enable us to progress faster in our two key markets.”"

It’s now a priority space for marketing teams, business analysts and companies right around the world, and the space is growing and innovating at an astounding pace. This new deal is giving the Spanish company the chance to grow its content portfolio and enter the audio and video content categories as a strong market contender.

2022.6.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/madrid-based-samara-scores-e2-million-to-help-households-transition-to-green-energy/,"On a mission to accelerate the clean energy transition in households, Spanish startup Samara has just scored €2 million. The cleantech company is helping homes become smarter, more efficient and more sustainable. The transition to clean energy is at the forefront of the environmental agenda across Europe. With ambitious targets to reach Net Zero, the entire continent is now racing to become more sustainable with regard to energy consumption. Aiming to help households take more control of their energy use, and go green, Samara has just secured €2 million in pre-seed funding. The funding round for the Madrid-based startup was led by Seaya and Pelion Green Future. Seaya is the leading European and Latin American Venture Capital fund behind unicorns such as Wallbox, Glovo and Cabify, and Pelion is an independent investment holding focused on clean energy, technology and climate-related solutions. Founded just this year by Iván Cabezuela —ex-Country Manager of Bulb in Spain and ex-Amazon and Uber— and Manel Pujol —ex-Country Manager of Uber Eats and Alan in Spain, the startup is wanting to make an impact and fast. The startup accompanies households to move to clean energy from start to finish – providing a personalized study, installation, maintenance and monitoring. The company is committed to helping households control and produce their own energy through services focused on solar panels, EV chargers and batteries. But they go beyond just the technical installation of equipment, additionally offering a comprehensive advisory service provided by energy managers and engineers who use technology to facilitate the process, both financially and logistically. In doing so, Samara offers a service that is transparent and personalized to each household, making it easier for clients to adopt green energy as their individual needs and extenuating circumstances are considered. The company also prides itself on being there for the long term – acknowledging that the transition to green and clean energy is not just about an overnight fix, but rather a long-term strategy that needs constant review. By accompanying households in their transition to a more efficient energy model, Samara aims to help Spanish households fight the climate crisis and reduce their carbon footprint. It’s also democratising access to renewable solar tech, which is traditionally monopolized by large companies. Manel Pujol, Co-Founder of Samara, explained: “Our engineers and energy managers actively accompany the user throughout the process. We combine digital tools for the installation and maintenance with the human factor to offer a complete experience…We want the customer to become a small producer, facilitating their energy independence through digital tools and advice from our experts.” The startup reports that with their service, households can save up to 70% on electricity bills. Being self-sufficient really pays off in the increasingly turbulent energy market, and Samara wants to empower this. In addition to the economic savings, there is also a sustainability component. A point that Ivan Cabezuela, co-founder, highlighted: “Households are increasingly aware of the fight against climate change, and self-consumption has a positive environmental impact: by producing and consuming their own solar energy, an average household avoids the emission of 1.2 tons of CO2 per year.” Samara certainly holds an interesting and unique offering in the energy market – and one that is vital on the road to Net Zero. We will definitely be keeping an eye out on this startup to see what is to come! Carlos Fisch, Seaya’s investment director, added: “We are very pleased to support Manel, Ivan and the Samara team in their mission to accelerate the adoption of solar energy in households. This investment reinforces our commitment to support exceptional founders who have a clear mission and purpose, and are committed to long-term sustainable growth.”"
2022.6.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/10-europeans-startups-fueling-the-transition-to-a-circular-economy/,"The European Green Deal sets out the aim for Europe to reach net-zero by 2050 – which would make Europe the first climate-neutral continent. The European Green Deal also includes the Circular Economy Action Plan. Transitioning Europe towards a circular economy will reduce pressure on natural resources and create sustainable economic growth and jobs. Europe is a global leader in the circular economy policy. The European government has influenced changes in the law to support a shift to a circular economy with policies like banning single-use plastics, settings targets for reuse and recycling, and obligations for separate collection of textiles and biowaste. With the ambitions the European government has set out, it makes sense that Europe is the home to a bunch of interesting startups that are helping us move away from a linear economy. They are promoting circularity across various verticals from recycling, product packaging, fashion, groceries, and solutions for families with growing children. Alongside circular economy startups, there are funds focusing on deploying their capital into the circular economy. Amsterdam-based Polestar Capital announced the launch of Europe’s biggest circular economy fund earlier this year. Other funds that are focused on this space in Europe include Edinburgh-based Circularity Capital and New York-based Closed Loop Partners. Let’s dive into to explore startups that are making strides towards furthering the circular economy in Europe:  Reath: Founded in 2019, Reath is an Edinburgh-based startup working on making reusable packaging more common than single-use. They have collaborated with Innovate UK, the Open Data Institute, and Lancaster University to create the world’s first Open Data Standard for reusable packaging called reuse.id. The easy-to-use platform creates “digital passports” for physical items and tracks items at every stage of their lifecycle. Their technology is set to revolutionise how companies monitor and store data needed for adopting safe, compliant, scalable reusable packaging systems. They have secured commercial partnerships with brand names like M&S and Bower Collective. Last year, the team raised €365K pre-seed investment. Sojo:Sojo is on a mission to help make the fashion industry more circular by making clothing repair and tailoring services convenient and mainstream. Their D2C platform connects customers to local seamsters and customers have their items picked up and dropped off by a bicycle courier – customers can get repairs and alterations without leaving their homes. They also have a B2B offering and have partnered with GANNI to offer free tailoring and repairs for their London-based customers. Sojo was founded in 2021 and recently closed its €2.2 million pre-seed funding round. With the funds, Sojo will scale up its team and further develop its B2B proposition. Cirplus: Hamburg-based cirplus is the global B2B marketplace for recycled plastics. They are digitising and shortening the transaction process for plastic processors and recycling companies. Founded in 2018, the platform consolidates all aspects of the transaction process including finding, negotiating, contracting, shipping, insurance, and paying for recyclates and plastic waste. Its mission is to lower costs for recyclates over virgin plastics, which supports the shift to a circular economy in plastics. To date, cirplus has raised a total of €3.5 million and currently has 21 employees. Again: Again is on a mission to shift billions of units of packaging from disposable to reusable. The company is building a distributed network of hundreds of autonomous cleaning facilities, called CleanCells. Each facility processes and cleanses packaging for use by the world’s largest FMCG brands. By 2025, they aim to create a world where reuse surpasses single-use on every metric. This would save billions of units of packaging from landfills or incineration. Again is based in London with 7 employees and was founded in 2021. Greyparrot: Greyparrot is an analytics platform for the circular economy. Greyparrot leverages computer vision technology to monitor, analyse, and sort tonnes of waste at scale. Poor packaging design and ineffective recycling sorting mean that most of what goes into recycling bins ends up in landfills. Greyparrot is bringing transparency and automation into an inefficient system. Their technology has analysed over 10 billion packaging items in sorting plants to increase recycling rates and introduce accountability to the waste value chain. Providing data on waste can impact government policies on recycling and packaging data. Greyparrot was founded in 2019 and recently raised its €10.2 million Series A. Bike Club: Bike Club offers subscriptions for kids’ bikes that can be exchanged as children grow up. Children grow fast and getting a new bike each time, a child grows out of their current one is a pain nor is it affordable. The company, founded in 2016, is the only FCA (the financial services regulator in the UK) regulated hire-exchange platform. Bike Club recently closed their Series B with a €19.5 million raise. With the funds, they are pedalling towards expanding across the UK and Europe.  Fairown: Fairown is on a mission to empower more brands to shift from a linear to a circular economy. They enable environmentally conscious businesses to offer their products for monthly subscriptions and ensure a smooth product renewal cycle by collecting and utilising old products. Before going out to fundraise, the company bootstrapped to profitability, €1.2 million in revenue, and expanded across eight countries. Fairown is based in Tallinn, was founded in 2018, and has raised about €4.2 million to date.  Twig: Founded in 2021, Twig calls themselves the “bank of things” and is giving things that consumers no longer want a new life. They are empowering consumers to unlock value and wealth that they didn’t know that they had. Consumers can upload their items in less than 30 seconds, receive a valuation, and get an instant offer to cash out their things. Twig is based in London, currently has 81 employees, and has raised a total of €38.7 million. Vinterior:Vinterior is the leading marketplace for curated vintage furniture and home accessories. Consumers are increasingly looking for unique, stylish, and sustainable furniture. Because the furniture market remains mostly fragmented, consumers’ options are to settle for “fast furniture”, expensive design stores, or spend time scavenging through vintage stores. Vinterior was founded in 2016 with 12 London dealers and 200 mid-century furniture pieces. Since its launch, they have grown to a community of 1,800 vintage sellers across Europe. They are based in London with 60 employees. Vinterior recently raised a €9.3 million Series A round, with the funds they are accelerating growth and expansion into new markets. Good Club: Born in 2019,Good Club is making zero-waste shopping simpler. They deliver customers a range of groceries in reusable, plastic-free packaging with carbon-neutral doorstep delivery. They are currently delivering groceries to customers across the UK. To date, they have raised €5.05 million. Good Club has been working to grow their range of products in response to customer demand. They recently announced a partnership with Müller Group’s Milk & More doorstep delivery service.

As the summer heats up, sports tech is continuing to attract a lot of attention and investment. It’s an area with huge growth potential as well as the space to positively impact the lives of millions around the world. Sport is well recognised to be part of a healthy lifestyle and brings heaps of benefits – from improved physical health, and mental wellness to personal development. On a mission to use AI to democratize sports analytics, German startup Staige has raised €8.5 million in fresh funding with Borussia Dortmund as a strategic investor. Founded under the name Soccerwatch in Essen in 2017, Staige is now a strong team of 60 working in Essen and Duisburg, Germany. The startup manufactures a camera that, using AI, autonomously records sports footage and can then stream live on the internet. At the moment, the cameras are mainly used in amateur sports. Along with an integrated coaching tool, clubs can use the tech to immediately conduct performance-oriented match and training analyses. It, therefore, democratizes sports tech that until now has really only been accessible by the pros. Further, the tech is accessible to all sports – whether individual or team-based. The company operates its own streaming portal, staige.tv, where more than 50k sporting and cultural events are available live and on-demand. While sports are the focal point, the tech is also used by churches and theatres. Hundreds of sports and other cultural events are added every weekend. Staige is already used in over 1000 locations across Europe and these new funds will help boost the team’s reach. With world-famous team Borussia Dortmund as a partner, Staige is able to enhance its market position in providing amateur sports with AI – making live streaming and video analysis more accessible and affordable. The startup will also benefit from the experiences and needs of Borussia Dortmund professional players. This strong collaboration is to be used by Staige to develop even better products for automated video production and video broadcasting. Carsten Cramer, Managing Director of Borussia Dortmund, commented: “Together, we are committed to supporting the foundation of our sport: the amateurs. The standard of our professionals should become feasible in all leagues.” In addition to the partnership with Borussia Dortmund, the startup has also just announced a partnership with Spanish- based broadcaster Footters to digitize the Spanish grassroots football market. Footters chose Staige‘s AI solution as the best technology to produce and broadcast sports events giving supporters and parents the chance to have their kids‘ matches live and on-demand, to share it with their loved ones.    Combined with the network and experience of Footters in the Spanish sports media landscape this partnership simplifies the football club ́s entrance to broadcasting media content.    With the new funds, the company will keep investing in the quality and quantity of its products, following its plans of international expansion. New features are also expected to be added to the built-in video analysis software. Staige CEO Jan Taube, added: “We have been working with Borussia Dortmund for a long time. The latest developments underpin our synergies in the sports sector. Our young company is now taking the next step in its development. Supported by great investors and formed by an extremely talented and motivated team. BVB and Staige, this cooperation has been working very well for several years already. We are proud to be able to expand the partnership.“"
2022.6.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/french-fintech-formance-secures-e2-9-million-to-help-companies-build-and-track-payment-flows/,"Operating payment flows is a fundamental part of growing a business. For marketplaces, platforms and fintechs, these flows constantly have to be tracked, analysed and evolved to fit market trends, needs and competitor movement. Making it quick and easy, Formance has secured €2.9 million. Developing a low-code solution to build, track and implement payment flows in real-time, French fintech startup Formance has just raised about €2.9 million in fresh funding. The investment was led by Hoxton Ventures, Frst, Y Combinator and several business angels. Business angels include Revolut’s former VP of global business, Don Hoang, and Silvr’s CRO, Pierre Youenou. Founded in 2021 by Clément Salaün and Anne-Sybille Pradelles, the startup is developing an open-source solution to build and manage money flows based on pre-built, fully customizable use-case templates. The startup is tackling a fundamental segment of the payment value chain which is still overly complicated and lacking a simple solution. Money flows are regarded as the lifeblood of companies – whether it be a marketplace, a platform or a fintech itself – managing flows between pay-ins and pay-outs is critical. Further, players have to constantly make their payment flows evolve to fit market trends, users’ needs, and competitors’ moves. Company growth is closely linked to the capacity to process an increasing volume of transactions and to integrate new payment scenarios, which can become increasingly complex. Currently, tech teams of fintechs and marketplaces are tasked with the complicated job of building payment flows from scratch and the way they are broken down, then, making them evolve according to the development and the strategy of the company. It takes time, money and resources. The goal of Formance is to provide companies with the means to unlock new business opportunities quickly, helping them diversify and increase revenues without the need to build payment flows from scratch. The French fintech has developed a library of ready-to-use- use-cases which are easily integrated. As a result, the startup offers technical teams a solution for modelling their specific payment scenarios and simplifying the process of breaking down and tracking these money flows properly. The product is built upon four key pillars; a low-code basis, pre-built and customisable templates, a transaction ledger, and, real-time transaction tracking tools. It means that tech teams can implement and create payment flows in a matter of hours rather than days, finance teams can track financial flows, and, teams have greater data analysis opportunities. Already adopted by users in both Europe and the US, the startup is able to meet the needs of both startups and SMEs as well as more mature companies looking for new business opportunities. To maximise accessibility, the Formance language and ledger are open-source and companies can subscribe to real-time transaction tracking tools based on the number of transactions they have. With this first round of funding, Formance is kickstarting its goal to become the leading solution for orchestrating post-payment flows."
2022.6.21,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/stockholm-based-carla-raises-e19-million-for-its-ev-marketplace/,"Electric Vehicles and e-mobility options are undoubtedly the way forward for transport in Europe. Building an easy way to buy and lease electric vehicles online, Swedish startup Carla has just picked up €19 million. Moving to a more sustainable society requires reimaging how we move. On a mission to help us get from A to B in a more environmentally-friendly way, Carla is building an e-commerce marketplace specifically for electric cars. The startup has just secured €19 million in fresh funding and is driving forward its journey to lead this space in Europe. The funding was led by Bonnier Ventures, with participation from investors including Inbox Capital, Black Ice, and VNV Global, bringing the total funding for the Swedish startup to €32 million. Founded in 2021 by Patrik Illerstig, formerly Head of Global Online Business at Volvo Cars, and Niklas Jungegård, a serial tech entrepreneur, Carla was launched with the ambition to make one of life’s more stressful and challenging decisions simpler – that of buying a car. At the same time, the startup wants to make sure the choice is a sustainable one. With Carla, customers can buy, sell or lease electric cars online. Customers are offered a pickup and delivery time of just 72 hours and all EVs go through battery testing and inspection to ensure the best condition of each vehicle. This is in addition to a 12-month guarantee, favourable financing, a 14-day right of withdrawal, and free returns when Carla picks up the car. Looking to the future, the funding will be used to fuel the international expansion of the Nordic marketplace, scale product development, increase the capacity for deliveries and repair of cars, and, the development of aftermarket services. Patrik Illerstig, CEO and founder of Carla, said: “We are proud to be raising money from reputable investors, both existing and new – despite the current global and market situation. It is reassuring that we, together with our investors, share the long-term vision of radically improving the experience of selling, acquiring, and owning an electric car.” Dajana Mirborn, Investment Director at Bonnier Ventures, added: “We are glad to be supporting Carla in this round and are impressed by the growth it has shown and the reception the service has received in the market. The investment is also part of our increased focus on sustainability and an important investment in relation to the transition to a more sustainable society. We look forward to following and supporting the company on its continued journey that is only in its infancy.”"

The startup just secured over €474k in pre-seed funding for its AI-based marketplace. It’s the era of content consumption and demand for quality video content is ramping up around the world. Businesses – from startups to enterprises – are increasingly looking for easy-to-create quality content at scale. Helping them do so, Austrian startup 25superstars just scored more than €474k in fresh capital. The investment came from LVC Investments and business angels. Founded in 2021 by Rustem Akishbekov, the marketplace has been designed to save businesses time and money whilst simultaneously helping creators from around the world earn extra money. Having previously founded Robo Wunderkind (a robotics company), as well as having been a partner at Arkley VC, Rustem has first-hand experience with this challenge. Rustem Akishbekov, CEO commented: “Today, we are very excited to announce the public launch of 25superstars. Our team has been hard at work for over a year. One of our primary focuses is to help content creators all over the world to improve their earnings, as we believe these industry professionals are underpaid. The other goal we are trying to achieve is to assist businesses in scaling their video content creation. Our team is thankful for our investors and customers, with their support we have been able to grow. Now, we are more than ready to grow even faster with the upcoming funding.” The Vienna-based company has gathered together a team of designers, engineers and data scientists to develop machine learning powered by suggestions, which helps make decisions about which creators companies should work with, and what type of video content is the best fit. While 25superstars is connecting companies with creators, it is providing creators with an additional income. These creators earn money by creating high-quality content that is used on clients’ websites, ads, testimonials, or social media accounts. All creators are individually vetted and validated for their skills and are interviewed before they are activated on the platform and eventually matched with a company. Speaking about the benefit of the platform, content creator Viriginia Stienmann said: “I have family in Canada and Switzerland. Once I moved to Europe, I fell in love with traveling. I’m living in Portugal now and moving to Spain in a few months. My passion is content creation, and 25superstars has enabled that to take off. Content Creation with 25superstars allows me to have a lot of freedom and live wherever I want.” The Austrian company is working with a variety of brands – from early-stage startups to mature and well-established companies. The video content demand is one that spans markets, industries and companies of all sizes in search of quality creations. The easy-to-use platform works with a machine learning algorithm that matches businesses with the most suitable creators. After the brand selects from the matched creators, they can begin discussions on the details of the video content that is required. The selected creators receive a notification with all the information required for the task. It works on an international scale – connecting businesses and creators across borders and accelerating the creation of content. Arsen T., Marketing Manager at Relai (Swiss Fintech), said: “I think that the era of Instagram, where you put the polished picture of your food and everything looks clean is slowly transitioning away. With short form video, some creators don’t even show their faces, but this is the type of content that works. When you go to Instagram reels or TikTok, you see lots of genuine and authentic content. It’s like low effort because it creates that genuine connection and I think it’s just part of a bigger trend. It’s really great that there is 25superstars where we can get this kind of trendy content.” Already, the platform has about 1000 registered creators worldwide, having onboarded talent from Australia, India, Africa, Canada, the United States and Europe. It’s also building a strong reputation for itself among creators and companies alike. This new dunning will help scale the product, accelerating the development of this marketplace. Rustem added: “We are opening an office in San Francisco in the next couple of months and opening an entity there. We are growing by 20 per cent every month, and the number of creators on our platform is projected to be around 3,000 by the end of the year” With the demand for content continuing to soar on a global level, 25superstars is entering a market with massive growth potential. Its benefit is already being recognised, marking an exciting future for the company. Weronika Adkonis, Marketing Manager at StormX (US based crypto company) added: “Working with 25superstars has completely changed how I work. No longer do I need to spend hours creating content within my team nor do I have to constantly send back and forth emails confirming briefs and details like you often need to when working with other content agencies. The team at 25superstars has been staying super vigilant over our campaigns, reducing the need for creator and brand interaction. Their newly released creator platform also allows for a straightforward content ordering process.”"

Having developed a digital treatment for erectile dysfunction, that doesn’t require any pills, Kranus Health has pocketed more than €6 million in Series A funding. While Viagra has been a globally recognised treatment for years now and was one of the most popular prescription uptakes of any medication, Kranus Health is hoping to bring a new option to the market with even more success. And they’re well on their way – the launch has been regarded as one of the most successful for a digital therapeutic in Germany. The funding was led by French health care investor Karista and Austria-based Family Office Peak Pride. All existing shareholders, including HTGF and A Round Capital, followed up with significant further investments. The team also gained investment from renowned business angels such as Saarbruecker21 and Florian Brand, the founder and CEO of atai Life Sciences. Founded in 2020, Kranus Health is on a mission to bring solutions and treatments to men’s health issues that are less widely talked about and even seen as taboo. In January 2022, the health tech startup launched the potency app, Kranus Edera and within months had issued thousands of prescriptions. The Munich and Berlin-based platform offers a holistic and digital approach to treating erectile dysfunction, a health issue that impacts more men than one may assume. The app provides a fully reimbursable treatment option for millions of men affected by erectile dysfunction and is already being prescribed by hundreds of urologists across Germany. The digital therapeutic can be prescribed in addition to medication or as a stand-alone therapy, providing patients with long-term prospects for recovery. The treatment is based on digital coaching that comprises a 12-week therapy consisting of pelvic floor training, physical therapy exercises, cardiovascular endurance training, mindfulness and body awareness exercises, as well as sexual therapy exercises. In addition, patients receive daily background knowledge to improve their understanding of the underlying principles of erectile function and the influence of lifestyle factors, such as nutrition or stress. Taking on the wide remit of men’s health, the startup is developing digital therapies for many widespread medical conditions. As explained by the founder and co-CEO, Thilo Kleinschmidt: “At Kranus Health, we break taboos and solve men’s health issues that no one talks about.” To this end, there are many widespread conditions to focus on. Erectile dysfunction, which impacts every third male, is the primary focus, alongside incontinence, which impact 20% of men over 60, as well as prostate enlargement (BPH), which is thought to affect every second man over 50 years. The Kranus Health team, which includes an interdisciplinary makeup of experts, are using technology to make health care provision more accessible and less taboo. Thilo added: “There is a great deal of potential in treatment backed by digital technology. We are improving patient care and allowing specialists to prescribe therapies that are in line with medical guidelines.” The new funding will be used for further clinical research to develop additional digital therapies. A large randomized, controlled trial (RCT) on the efficacy of treatment with Kranus Edera app is being conducted this year with the university teaching hospital in Münster (Universitätsklinikum Münster). The company aims to modernize the approach to men’s intimate health issues and will contribute to normalizing communication about them. In addition, the team, with the existing headcount of 50, is set to be doubled to more than 100 members of staff. Baudouin Hue, partner at Karista, commented: “Karista’s substantial investment into Kranus Health matches the companies impressive execution in a very short time, recording the most successful digital therapeutic (DiGA) launch, as well as the potential to address large unmet medical needs affecting hundreds of million of men worldwide.”"

Launching its second investment fund, dedicated to digital startups and aiming to boost Belgium’s startup community, Seeder Fund is raising €30 million. In 2016, Seeder Fund launched a seed fund to support promising digital startups in making their first steps to success. The fund was built by a team with experience in entrepreneurship, investment and VC – giving a real wealth of knowledge behind the venture. Since then, Seeder Fund has established itself as a major player in the Belgian market. The fund has supported several digital superstars, including Keyrock, Dog Chef, MyskillCamp, Urbantz, ProUnity, Hello Customer, Next Gate Tech, WeGroup and Levenue. Now, after funding 40 startups which have collectively raised over €120 million, Seeder Fund is raising its second fund. The fund, which should soon hit €30 million, will be used to support an additional 50 digital startups over the next 5 years. With this launch, Seeder Fund confirms its commitment to investing in early-stage startups, helping innovators make those crucial first steps. Pierre-François Hellebuyck, partner at Seeder Fund: “After having supported 40 startups withourfirst fund,we are launching oursecond investment fund. We aim for a total fund size of EUR 30 million,fullydedicated to digital startups.With Seeder II we have theambition to invest in more than 50, mainly Belgian, startups in the next 5 years.” Seeder Fund’s approach is fully dedicated to the challenges of seed capital, with very fast decision-making processes, individualized support and significant investment capacity for subsequent financing rounds. Through prioritising personalised support and consuming on achieving key milestones, the fund enhances the chances of success. As a testament to this, almost 30% of the portfolio companies raise further capital to accelerate their growth, making Seeder Fund one of the most successful seed funds in Europe. The relevance of the investment model developed by Seeder Fund and its impact on the Belgian ecosystem has proven itself. Several major players such as Belfius Insurance and numerous private investors with a strong entrepreneurial spirit are stepping into the adventure, alongside the main historical shareholders – namely the fund managers, SFPI, Sambrinvest, ULB and a group of private investors already present in Seeder I. The fund also has the added bonus of having higher average investment amounts – the first ticket of €100k to €250k in seed and up to €500k for startups with proven commercial traction. The aim is to accelerate the first round of funding of promising startups by providing a significant part of the initial budget that startups need while allowing for a very fast decision-making process. It aims to follow the different funding rounds of startups with an average investment capacity of around €1.5 million per startup. The fund will continue to invest primarily in Belgium but will expand its presence to neighbouring countries such as Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. Alongside the announcement of this fund, the management team of Seeder Fund have also just welcomed Isabelle Tennstedt to the fold. As Senior Investment Manager at PMV, she has previously guided the growth of numerous successful digital startups, such as WIllow and Supply Stack. While the first three investments are expected to be announced soon – in sectors such as mobility, telecommunications and hospitality – the number of investments should double by the end of the summer. The fund has until March 2023 to welcome new investors to increase its investment capacity and its impact on the Belgian entrepreneurial ecosystem."
2022.6.21,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/munich-based-tradelink-picks-up-e12-million-to-build-frictionless-supply-chains/,"While the global supply chain is hit with more and more challenges, Munich-based startup TradeLink has secured €12 million in Series A funding to streamline logistics with its collaboration platform. The global supply chain is under increasing pressure, and as a result, operators are struggling to keep up with demand. TradeLink, a supply chain collaboration platform developed speciifclaly to streamline warehouse operations has just announced a raise of €12 million to tackle the issue. The funding was led by Insight Partners with participation from existing investors Point Nine and Fly Ventures and angel investors Alexander Doll (former CFO of Deutsche Bahn), David Nothacker (CEO of Sennder), Alex Hersham (CEO of Zencargo), and Stephan Kniewasser (former CEO of Transporeon, TeamViewer). In recent years, supply chains have faced more and more challenges and pressures – from delivery bottlenecks and missing materials to rising logistics costs, lack of shipment transparency and overworked warehouse staff. It’s led to inefficiencies and process breakdowns that are costing players throughout the value chain billions of euros, and impacting employees and customers. Munich-based TradeLink is taking a tech-first approach to solving the supply chain crisis. Founded in 2020 by Frederic Krahforst and Tobias Nendel, the startup’s platform enables customers to move away from time-cosnuming and inefficient manual spradhseets and email to simplifgie and automated exchanges between all parties in the supply chian. It’s based on a collaborative principle – enhancing communication and how people can work together through the entire chain. CEO & Co-Founder Frederic Krahforst, explained: “TradeLink was grown out of the feedback provided by people who struggle with logistics operations day in and day out. Logistics and warehouse operations professionals want a solution that fits intuitively, quickly, and pragmatically into their everyday work – which is what we took to heart.” TradeLink connects all delivery partners – forwarders, suppliers, shippers, and warehouse operators – with just a few clicks and automates the alignment of digital papers, expected delivery time, load information, and communication to improve business results for all participants in the supply chain. While TradeLink’s initial wedge into customers is around efficient coordination of warehouse deliveries, its long-term goal is to create an end-to-end digital collaboration platform for process orchestrations and document management between shippers, warehouses, and carriers. Michael Shephard, Vice President at Insight Partners, said: “TradeLink has created a digital solution that identifies inefficiencies and process breakdowns in supply chains, saving customers time and money along the way. With its intuitive workflow tooling and analytics targeted at warehouse operators, TradeLink solves a critical communications gap between buyers and other supply chain stakeholders.” The Munich-based company already has leading brands like Sportscheck, Outfittery, Internetstores, Denner AG (Migros Group), Debatin, or SCHOTT using the platform to manage and orchestrate their delivery coordination. Oliver Kurzweil, team logistic lead for German retail giant Sportscheck, commented: “With TradeLink, we finally have transparency and automation in the delivery process for all parties involved. Internally, our purchasing and sales departments benefit [by being able to quickly and easily communicate and collaborate with our external 3PL Fiege, suppliers, and other partners in the supply chain] as well as our external 3PL Fiege and our suppliers.” This new funding will be used to enhance the SaaS platform further, scale sales and marketing activities and deliver on the goal of developing the simplest and most effective platform to collaborate in logistics and supply chains."
2022.6.21,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/corporate-and-startup-collaboration-how-closing-the-loop-and-vodafone-are-tackling-e-waste/,"Making the world greener and making society more sustainable requires collective action. We each play a part, but we each play a part in a wider puzzle. One way that better practices are being achieved is through collaborations between multinational corporations and innovators. Taking this approach to tackling e-waste, Vodafone Germany is now working with Closing the Loop on a one-for-one initiative. It’s been reported that in 2019, around 53.6 million tons of e-waste was generated worldwide. This is a staggering figure, that only hits harder when it’s further noted that this is a 21% increase over the past five years. And it doesn’t get better from there. It’s estimated that e-waste will double by 2050 as tech continues to be viewed as disposable. E-waste is, therefore, one of the fastest-growing streams of waste the world currently faces and it poses a major threat to both people and the environment. Mobile phones and thrown-away electronic devices tend to end up in landfills, disproportionately in developing countries, rather than in recycling centres. As a result, toxins and pollutants are released into the local environment, contaminating nearby citizens, oceans, and our planet as a whole. It’s simply not sustainable and something needs to be done about it. While e-waste is piling up, not only is it polluting environments, but it’s also wasting valuable raw materials, such as gold, silver, palladium and cobalt which are found in the devices and can be recovered during recycling processes. In tackling waste in society, there have been a few approaches that are leading the way forward. One of the stand-out approaches is to pioneer the transition to a circular economy. This refers to using materials and goods in a loop, rather than simply casting away what can still be valuable. It’s about recycling and being creative rather than wasteful. But how can a circular economy be created? One such approach is through collaboration. Startups across Europe are leading the green transition, fueling new innovations to make the continent more sustainable and to promote green tech across the board. Connecting startup innovation and dynamism with the power and clout of multinationals is proving a fruitful way forward in the transition to a circular economy. It gives the innovators the needed scope and capital to make an impact. Vodafone and Closing the Loop have just announced a partnership that illustrates how this can be the way of the future. With the unique one-for-one promise, the digitization group Vodafone Germany has committed to a responsibility that for every mobile phone sold to private customers, they will bring an old mobile phone back into the cycle. This will be done in collaboration with Closing the Loop, a Dutch startup offering certified e-waste compensation. This will mean that mobile phones, often discarded in landfills in countries without recycling structures, will be professionally recycled every year. The two companies expect to compensate at least one million new devices per year, which means that also at least one million end-of-life devices will be collected in African countries. Vodafone will also ensure that in Germany smartphones will have a longer life cycle and join a closed cycle through optimized repair, re-trade and recycling services. As a leading mobile communications provider, Vodafone provides its customers with the latest mobile communications technologies and devices – but this doesn’t have to come at the expense of the environment and society. With the One for One initiative, the Düsseldorf-based group ensures that for every mobile phone sold to private customers, one is also recycled – with e-waste compensation. This service will be performed by Closing the Loop, starting June 2022. Andreas Laukenmann, Managing Director of Private Customers at Vodafone Germany, explained: “We are declaring war on e-waste and taking our responsibility to close the mobile phone cycle seriously. With the unique One for One promise, we contribute to more sustainable mobile communications. Not only with green networks, which we operate exclusively with green electricity but also in terms of the circular economy. Through certified recycling of cell phones from developing countries, we want to recover over a million cell phones every year. This is a good start to establishing a new understanding of e-waste: among end customers and providers. For every electrical device that is sold, one has to go back into the cycle.” Founded in 2012, Closing the Loop is a Dutch company operating in 9 countries providing world-leading green procurement services for electronics. The certified e-waste compensation service supports companies in their sustainability efforts, to increase their economic potential and achieve important KPIs. E-waste compensation enables the proper collection and professional recycling of e-waste in emerging countries. As a result, it’s a business model for reducing the world’s fastest-growing waste stream. Closing the Loops e-waste compensation service meets the strict requirements as an approved collector for e-waste compensation in TCO Certified, assured by KPMG and the entire supply chain is made transparent and auditable through a supply tool called Chainpoint. The service is supported by numerous NGOs as well as the Dutch government, GIZ and the Öko-Institut. Working with Vodafone, Closing the Loop collects old mobile phones in countries without recycling infrastructure for Vodafone and ensures they are brought back into the life cycle. It means that the collected mobile phones do not end up in landfills, where incineration results in substances such as lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic poisoning people and the environment, but instead are professionally recycled. Further, valuable raw materials and rare earths such as gold, silver, copper and cobalt are put back into circulation and do not have to be mined, preventing social and ecological costs. From a societal standpoint, there are notable benefits as well. Closing the Loop pays for the old phones, creating jobs and income in socially disadvantaged regions. Currently, mobile phones are mostly collected in Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon. Joost de Kluijver, Managing Director and founder of Closing the Loop, commented: “Our service for e-waste compensation offers a starting point towards greener tech. We help customers consume their devices in a way that better aligns with their values, for example in Germany. At the same time, the service fights an increasing acute danger to people and the environment. We prevent electronic waste challenges before they arise: through recycling instead of dumping the waste. In this way, valuable resources can be reused, income is created in Africa and our customers can get started on making the use of electronics greener.” Looking at the figures, it’s reported that the collection and recycling of mobile phones from developing countries reduces CO2 emissions by more than 1000 g per device. Through the Vodafone compensation of more than one million mobile phones, the CO2 emissions are reduced by at least 1000 tons annually. At the moment, the collected devices are shipped back to Europe for recycling, however, CLosing the Loop is supporting the construction of recycling capacities directly in developing countries. The funding created by compensating at least one million mobile phones per year with Vodafone will greatly speed up that process. In the future, this will avoid the shipping of e-waste and create more jobs and income in developing countries. While tackling e-waste isn’t new to the green agenda and the narrative surrounding sustainability, this initiative formed on a basis of collaboration is a positive milestone in terms of actionable processes being put in place. It represents a concrete example of how change can be made and how society can become greener, more circular, and ultimately, more sustainable."
2022.6.22,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/london-based-kiko-ventures-launches-as-a-e427-million-platform-to-support-transformative-climate-tech/,"Innovation and investment in climate tech are ramping up across Europe. Reflecting this, Kiko Ventures has launched as the world’s first evergreen cleantech venture investor, with a platform of over €427 million dedicated to climate tech innovators. Both the investment space and the wider startup community in Europe have woken up to the importance of innovation in the climate tech space, and Europe has real potential to become a world leader in this market. Across the continent, more and more investments are being made into startups pushing forward the green agenda, and it’s a welcome sign to see. Making a colossal statement of commitment to climate tech innovation, Kiko Ventures has just launched. It’s the world’s first evergreen cleantech venture investor. Backed by the FTSE 250-listed investment firm, IP Group, the platform of over €427 million is earmarked to invest in the next generation of climate tech visionaries and to create new possibilities for a regenerative future. Arne Morteani, Founding Partner of Kiko Ventures explained: “The climate crisis is the greatest challenge of our generation and from that challenge come new and life-changing possibilities for a regenerative world. I have been a part of the cleantech ecosystem for 20 years, most recently as a partner at a traditional VC. With Kiko we are now adding a new approach providing flexible, regenerative capital to address some of the most difficult challenges. We strive to be an investor that is fit for purpose as well as profit.” The team plans to deploy around €233 million over the next five years using IP Group’s flexible capital platform. Kiko will launch with existing assets, as well as a number of new investments already made under the Kiko strategy that is yet to be announced. The venture benefits from IP Group’s evergreen structure – through which returns from exits can be recycled into new opportunities, allowing for a true evergreen portfolio without crossover between fund vehicles and with a very long time horizon. This longevity is a crucial part of what makes this fund so important. It’s thinking long-term and will help grow the climate tech champions of the future. It also marks a big shake-up for VC investing generally, giving much-needed flexibility to a system that’s currently too structurally constrained to optimally address the climate challenge. The need to address the climate crisis, and the increasing urgency of this need, is nothing new. Across Europe, more and more investments have been geared toward climate tech and clean tech as it’s becoming clear that currently, we just are not moving fast enough to tackle the problems. Figures from Climate Tech VC suggest global investment in climate tech innovation reached an all-time last year. In addition, current global supply chain issues and energy crises are demonstrating that now, more than ever, we need to transition to greener and more sustainable habits and societies. Despite a healthy interest in investing in climate tech, and governmental support with Europe’s ambition to reach net-zero, most investors in the space operate traditional fund structures or need to adhere to the commercial agendas of corporate venture capital (CVC), imposing constraints on the existing financing landscape. This is where Kiko Ventures will be able to make a big difference. The Kiko team is made up of industry experts, lef by veterans Robert Trezona and Jamie Vollbracht, with new Partner Arne Morteani, who previously spent 14 years helping to build one of Europe’s leading cleantech VC funds. It’s comprised of people who know how the funding landscape works, and know what changes needed to be made to maximise impact. Robert Trezona, Founding Partner of Kiko Ventures commented: “I believe in the transformative power of climate technologies and have worked my whole career to elevate ideas from the lab into practical usable solutions that can make our world a better place. We’ve launched Kiko to unleash the full power of human ingenuity by uniting ideas, expertise and capital to unlock a sustainable future. To do this, we’ve created an investment model of truly flexible capital that empowers change, rather than hindering it.” This team has now designed Kiko Ventures, which leverages IP Group’s evergreen platform to take a more flexible approach, without the short time horizons, fixed capital constraints, and narrow mandates that are common in the industry. Kiko is therefore exceptionally aligned with entrepreneurs wanting to build category-leading companies for the long term. The team aims to enrich the existing ecosystem and become a reliable partner, to both entrepreneurs and fellow investors, in building a regenerative future. By operating as an evergreen platform, without a fixed 10-year mandate, Kiko can be highly flexible – able to do what’s required, not held back by constraints. It can be entrepreneurial through venture creation of new companies, investing at Seed and Series A/B stage or choosing to capitalise on opportunities in the public capital markets. Further, with the team’s expertise in climate tech more generally, they will be able to invest directly in those startups and innovations that will bring big returns. The team has historically made ambitious investments in high-conviction areas. Examples include fuel cell firm Ceres Power, which the team helped to take to unicorn exit; First Light Fusion, which recently achieved the world’s first fusion result; and Oxbotica, a pioneer in autonomous mobility software supplying some of the world’s largest companies like BP and ZF. Jamie Vollbracht, Founding Partner of Kiko Ventures said: “My realisation about the urgency of the climate crisis came shortly after leaving University and I decided to devote my career to doing what I could to help. I found I was most useful in commercialising innovative clean technologies and have sought to develop better ways to help those technologies flourish ever since. Kiko brings together all the insight I’ve been fortunate to glean over the past two decades and I hope it will make an outsized positive impact on the journey to a sustainable future. The launch of this fund certainly marks an exciting day for Europe’s investment space, and is a positive sign that we’ve been waiting for that climate tech is firmly on the agenda. Let’s watch this space!"

For many of us around the world, booking a trip and packing our bags to go on vacation is one of life’s joys. But what about when you have that itch to travel but don’t know where to go, or what to do when you get there? Or what about when you and your travel partner can’t meet eye to eye on the decision? Well, taking the choice out of travellers’ hands, UK-based Journee has developed a pioneering platform that matches people with experiential trips to mystery destinations. The startup has just secured about €2 million in a seed round led by Fuel Ventures and with angel investment from Depop’s founder, Simon Beckerman, and CEO, Maria Raga. As the world opens back up and people’s appetite for international travel returns, Journee is helping the culturally curious discover unknown destinations. As well as its matchmaking capabilities, Journee uses its technology to manage the booking process end-to-end – from how to get there and where to stay to what to do when you arrive. This summer, it has already been noted how travel prices have bounced back to pre-pandemic levels (if not even higher), so the company are entering a lucrative space with a very unique product. Founded in 2019 by three friends and former Depop colleagues with a passion for travel, Ed Tribe, Megha Chaturvedi and James Gillard, the vision is to bring curious travellers new places and cultures to explore – without burdening already busy lives with tons of research on where to go and what to book. Ed Tribe, Journee’s co-founder explained: “Our daily lives are busy with too many things on our to-do-lists. The process of booking a trip can be tedious and by the time you’ve decided on the destination and found the flights and hotel, most people are out of steam. Planning exciting things to do while you are away falls to the wayside. We have created a way to make it unbelievably easy to book an adventure you never knew you needed. And as we want our travellers to embrace the unknown, we don’t tell them where they’re going until they get to the airport!” The traveltech firm’s smart technology matches any person with their ideal trip using information gathered from a single questionnaire. Journee’s matchmaking technology is focused on delivering convenience to the consumer – reducing the time consumers take to plan and book a trip from 10-30 hours to just 15 minutes. Already, the company has recorded more than 1.5k bookings to over 52 mystery destinations and has a 4.9 rating on Trustpilot. With today’s investment and plans to grow their customer base and destinations list, Journee wants to make it as easy as possible to book the adventure of a lifetime by delivering an experience better than anyone could book on their own. Maria Raga, angel investor and CEO of Depop, added: “We were lucky to get to know Ed, Megha and James while they were at Depop and were impressed with their entrepreneurial spirit. They have a vision to make the world a better place by expanding people’s capacity to explore new cultures and have incredible travel experiences. I am excited to be supporting the Journee team’s ambitions in changing how people travel.”"

Personio can now be regarded as one of the fastest-growing and most valuable software startups on a global level. Based in Munich, Madrid, London, Dublin and Amsterdam, Personio is a startup making HR processes more transparent through the use of tech. The overarching aim, since it was founded in 2015, has been to allow HR teams to focus on what matters most – the people in a team. HRtech is big business in 2022. Through abrupt changes over the past couple of years in terms of how we work and where we work, businesses around the world are under more pressure than ever before to meet employee demands, and Personio is helping make this happen. The company just picked up a mega €190 million gaining an €8 billion valuation. Existing investor Greenoaks led the round. This new funding comes after an exciting year for the startup, full of impressive fast-paced growth, acquisitions and promising signs for the future. We chatted to founder, Roman Schumacher, earlier this year to find out more about the vision behind this incredibly exciting company. Getting the year off with a bang, Personioacquired Back a few months ago and supercharged its expansion across Europe. It also raised an immense €233.4 million in October of last year. With businesses continuing to digitise in our ever digitally and data-driven world, HR teams have had to adapt. Personio is helping SMEs do this, enabling them to have the same workflow capabilities previously reserved for the bigger budget and resource pools held by enterprises. The funds will turbocharge the development of People Workflow Automation, Personio’s vision to automate people processes across an organisation’s multiple departments and tools. Significant progress has been made to further develop an HR system that continues to provide business-enhancing efficiencies today while being engineered for the future. So far a billion data updates have been automated across Personio’s customer base already, replacing time-consuming manual tasks for customers. Hanno Renner, Co-Founder and CEO of Personio commented: “Our customers are the reason we exist and creating value for them is our first priority. We decided to raise the additional capital because we saw so many more ways to invest in our product that will increase the value we can provide. Those expansions will all be embedded into People Workflow Automation, which allows customers to automate workflows based on events in the employee lifecycle, from promotions and location changes to holiday requests. By continuing to focus on this strategy we expect to continue our strong growth trajectory and accelerate into 2022 and 2023, while providing customers with a great service that enhances the efficiency of their businesses.” Customers can now use over 100 integrated apps and APIs as well as new workflow automation and monitoring capabilities developed by Personio to reduce manual effort in tasks such as hiring, data analysis and time tracking. Together these improve operations across the employee lifecycle and allow HR teams to focus on more strategic tasks, reducing costs and helping to create efficient businesses. Neil Mehta, Founder and Managing Partner of Greenoaks Capital added: “Personio’s product has become an indispensable tool for Europe’s small and medium-sized businesses as they’ve bounced back from the challenges of the pandemic. As SMEs face the possibility of economic uncertainty ahead, Personio is a more critical platform than ever, helping customers make their HR and payroll processes more efficient and resilient while delighting employees and employers alike. We believe Personio is among the best SaaS companies in the world, with rapid growth, a sustainable business model, and exceptional leadership. We are thrilled to once again partner with Hanno and his team, and look forward to continuing our journey for many years to come.” Personio reports that now over 6k companies with over 500k employees are automating people processes through Personio. The software has scope to grow even further with its commitment to continued development, and, the fact the software is relevant across markets. Businesses from a wide variety of sectors rely on the HRtech, including tech companies such as Spendesk and ABOUT YOU, established mid-market players like Engel & Völkers as well as NGOs and public sector organisations such as Viva Con Agua and the Diana Award. While Personio can serve customers with 10 to 2,000 employees, it sees the biggest growth coming from companies between 200 to 2,000 employees that value the system’s feature depth. The sky really is the limit for this software company."
2022.6.22,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/london-based-stotles-secures-e6-1-million-to-streamline-how-businesses-and-governments-work-together/,"The Business-to-Government market is vital to the global economy. Aiming to simplify the sector, London-based Stotles has just secured about €6.1 million in Seed funding. The public sector is a lucrative target market for businesses across the world. Government contracts and government purchases fuel the global economy and they impact society across the board. Building a better way to do business with governments, London-based Stotles has just secured about €6.1 million. The Seed funding was led by Headline with participation from Form Ventures, GTMFund, Speedinvest, FJLabs, 7Percent, and several prominent angels. Doing business with the government gives companies a certain status, credibility, and a sense of confidence. And it comes with a lot of competitive energy – just look at the case of Microsfot and AWS who fought ruthlessly over the US government’s JEDI contract. Today, governments are increasingly turning to the private sector to find solutions for global challenges, particularly climate change. In the fight against climate change, more than 50% of spending is flowing from governments around the world and it’s bringing climate tech suppliers immense opportunity to score big-money contracts and transactions. However, these lucrative deals are not without serious challenges and bureaucracy. This is where Stotles, founded in 2019, is coming in. The startup is aiming to unlock the potential of how businesses and governments work together, streamlining the process for the betterment of all society. CEO, John Witt, explained: “The business-to-government (B2G) market is the $12 trillion backbone of the global economy. But, this market is in desperate need of some tender love and care. “Every day, we see the painful friction buyers and suppliers have to deal with — fragmented data, complex regulation, heavy compliance, messy workflows. Some call it ‘boring’, but they’re missing the point. This space has been overlooked for decades. By streamlining the business processes that connect business and government, the technology we’re building is capable of saving the world trillions every year – that’s something we get excited about.” Dealing with the public sector requires a unique approach, and, until now, it’s been a sector that most suppliers just aren’t equipped to deal with. Stotles is streamlining the end-to-end journey for businesses working with the public sector. Its initial product helps commercial teams boost their public sector sales productivity. Tailored to commercial teams such as sales, marketing, partner & alliance, and account management, the platform creates a ‘single source of truth’ for public sector business development tasks and data. It helps teams find more relevant opportunities faster, pinpoint buying signals earlier (before tender or RFP), and enable stronger qualification and faster prospect outreach with market data tools and key contact sources. It does this while plugging seamlessly into existing workflow and tech. Already, the startup jas picked up considerable traction with a fast-growing customer base. Leading companies like Workday, Tableau, and Gitlab have adopted the Stotles platform. Further, the startup is bolstered by the fact that, despite uncertain times, governments will always need to buy. It means that companies will always be in need of this tech to improve and streamline their processes to sell. Carsten Schaltz, co-founder and CPO, explained: “Governments will always need businesses, and this need will never go away. We’re solving fundamental business problems and this gives us powerful momentum, recession or boom.” Taj Kamranpour co-founder and COO, added: “Stotles helps foster competition in the public sector, thus driving better outcomes for government, taxpayers, and every member of society. This society-level impact is incredibly exciting and we can’t wait to do this at an even larger scale.” With this new funding, the young startup will boost product development and expand product and commercial teams. It’ll also expand into new segments of the public sector and into new locations beyond the UK."
2022.6.22,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/lisbon-based-flecto-bags-e1-2-million-to-fuel-the-transition-to-a-circular-economy/,"Helping businesses transition to and thrive in the circular economy, Portuguese startup Flecto has just secured €1.2 million for its all-in-one platform helping companies manage rental operations. The circular economy is the future. It’s a system that will enable society and businesses to grow more sustainably, and there is a big opportunity to make an impact in this space. Helping businesses thrive in the circular economy, giving them the chance to boost revenue and operate more sustainably, Flecto has just bagged €1.2 million. The funding was led by MSM, Übermorgen Ventures and Techstars. Traditional retail companies are increasingly looking for circular models – as much for environmental reasons as for financial ones. It’s a lucrative market, and if navigated correctly can improve customer loyalty and recurrence. Flecto, founded in 2016, has been built to allow these circular-minded companies to initiate rental operations with their customers, accelerating their adaptation process to more sustainable models that meet a new generation of consumers that values access over ownership. With Flecto, any brand can offer an alternative to buying and become a part of the circular economy – already worth a reported €36 billion in Western Europe and growing. The Lisbon-based startup began life as Rnters, a rental marketplace for all kinds of items. In early 2020, after participation in two accelerator programmes, the founders saw an opportunity to solve the problems in the rental industry, rather than just become another entity within it. This drove the creation of the Flecto platform which empowers companies to manage rental operations and leverage sales online. Guilherme Guerra, co-founder and CEO of Flecto, explained: “More and more companies and people are looking for alternative models to buying and selling: they just need the right tools to enter the Circular Economy. When we realized that companies were already using our platform to build online stores and manage inventory, we saw the opportunity for our product to solve the main problems around the equipment rental industry. Both in terms of security, digitization of processes, and setting up online stores. This is what drove the transformation from a peer-to-peer rental marketplace to a SaaS where companies can manage rental operations and leverage sales through an online store.” From managing inventory, reservations and customers to accessing insurance or creating an online store, Flecto provides a customizable experience that adapts to each business and grows with the company. The company already has more than 150 clients. Thanks to Flecto, these companies can rent out multiple items such as photographic and video material, sound or light systems, game consoles, computers, drones or bicycles. It’s an innovation that has great potential to push forward the circular economy agenda, and help Europe’s economy become rooted in sustainable practices. António Miguel, Managing Partner of the MSM impact fund, added: “We truly believe in Flecto. Since the beginning, we have had full faith in Flecto’s team as well as the market size, which is still underexplored by technological solutions. Furthermore, what we are excited about at Flecto is the potential for scale and the systemic impact of adopting consumption patterns that prioritize access and responsible consumption, to the detriment of purchasing goods and equipment that remain unused for long periods of time. Flecto’s impact proposal is unequivocal and can make our daily consumption significantly more efficient.” The fresh investment will be used by Flecto to continue supporting companies to transition their businesses to a circular model – namely encouraging the implementation of subscription and rental models."

The startup has developed a solution that enables businesses to benefit from instant, interest-free payment terms. The payments industry is undergoing a transition and it seems that the Buy Now Pay Later approach is becoming the new standard. Having developed a solution that is bringing cutting-edge payment solutions to businesses across Europe, London-based Hokodo is growing fast. The startup just raised over €37.8 million in fresh capital, less than a year after its Series A. The funding was led by Notion Capital, which participated in Hokodo’s Series A, with further investment from continental European investors Korelya Capital (FR), Mundi Ventures (ES), and Opera Tech Ventures (FR). Additional support came from existing investors including Anthemis and Mosaic Ventures. Founded in London with a strong European footprint, Hokodo’s BNPL solution is tailored to the B2B market, enabling business customers to benefit from instant, frictionless, interest-free payment terms. The solutions are underwritten by SCOR Syndicate 2015, SCOR SE’s corporate syndicate at Lloyd’s of London, allowing the fintech to guarantee its merchants 100% of their payments, even when the buyer is unable to pay. Richard Thornton, co-founder and co-CEO at Hokodo, explained: “We’re the only BNPL provider that meets all requirements of B2B merchants, including credit scoring, fraud detection, payments, collections, financing and credit insurance. We don’t rely on any third party to make credit decisions as we can do it much quicker in-house. This means we can accept more buyers at a faster rate, which our merchant partners love.” Founded in 2018, the fintech startup recently onboarded clients in France (Paris Fashion Shops) and Spain (Katoo), following launches in Belgium and the Netherlands (Ankorstore) earlier this year. This new funding will see the brand double down its efforts to become the B2B BNPL category leader in continental Europe, replicating its reputation and success to date in early markets. It’ll also be used to develop new BNPL solutions for telesales and in-store purchases as well as to venture into new verticals currently underserved by payments companies. Louis Carbonnier, co-founder and co-CEO at Hokodo, added: “The B2B purchasing experience has long lagged behind its B2C counterpart, and business customers are calling for higher quality services as online sales continue to gain ground in B2B. Hokodo provides merchants with a truly real-time credit solution at checkout, driving up conversion rates and enabling all parties to buy, sell and do more. Hokodo is currently the only pan-European Buy Now, Pay Later provider in B2B, and this funding will allow us to continue our international expansion to enable 1 million businesses to access a better way to pay by 2025.”"

The Frankfurt-based team just raised €22.5 million in Series A funding to expand its reach and impact. The transition to clean energy is fundamental to Europe’s aim to reach Net-Zero. While governments and societies are pushing for this, it’s not necessarily a simple change for businesses to make. Aiming to help businesses participate in clean energy, German startup ENVIRIA has just secured €22.5 million for its solar energy solutions. The round was co-led by European venture capital firm Redalpine and Galileo Green Energy, a pan-European renewable energy development and investment platform. BNP Paribas Développement and impact investor Alter Equity also participated. Founded in Frankfurt in 2017, ENVIRIA specializes in large-scale solar-centric energy solutions and Energy-as-a-Service concepts, customized for the distinct needs of businesses. The vision behind the company is to facilitate a renewable energy ecosystem by boosting B2B participation in the energy transition. Disrupting the market, the startup wants to make Europe’s approach to energy more sustainable, and empower a new generation approach to energy use. The startup offers easy access to solar by leveraging its in-house commercial and technical capabilities as well as its tailored financial expertise. This reduces the complexity companies face in becoming energy independent while meeting energy budgets as well as growing regulatory and socioeconomic targets to decarbonize the economy. Taking an integrated approach allows a broad spectrum of companies – whether they be small businesses or global corporates – to effectively reduce energy costs, pursue a sustainability agenda, and, contribute to the energy transition through solar. Antonius Salis, Investment Manager at Redalpine, said: “Decentralized power production is key to a successful energy transition. ENVIRIA makes solar energy easily accessible to companies and their large roof units by providing all-in-one solar solutions without distracting its clients from their core business. The power generated can be used by the companies themselves, which will lift energy consumption from commercial roofs that currently remain widely unused.” To date, the company has developed more than 105 commercial projects with an installed capacity of over 50MW – saving over 28.000 tons of CO2 emissions last year alone. Using the sun, ENVIRIA is harnessing the power of the planet rather than damaging it. Melchior Schulze Brock, ENVIRIA founder and CEO, commented: “Since our founding in 2017, we have grown the company, our expertise and our network organically. We are therefore uniquely positioned to enable companies to take their green ambitions into their own hands with the help of solar. This investment will allow us to set the scene for ENVIRIA to grow into a decentralized renewable energy platform specifically for the B2B sector. We are incredibly proud to have Redalpine, Galileo Green Energy, BNP Paribas and Alter Equity onboard, as we find their diverse profiles and fundamental understanding of ENVIRIA’s mission to be valuable assets for our future.”Ingmar Wilhelm, CEO of Galileo Green Energy, added: “We are delighted to become a shareholder of such a dynamic and innovative company, led by a CEO and a management team who combine forward-looking strategies with a highly pragmatic approach to delivering energy solutions to local customers. We are convinced that solar rooftops for commercial and industrial clients will be a key element in making energy supply affordable, sustainable and secure. ENVIRIA, supported by the new team of shareholders, is very well positioned to play an essential role in promoting businesses in Germany within the European energy transition”."
2022.6.23,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/uk-based-botsandus-scores-e12-3-million-to-make-warehouses-more-efficient-with-ai-and-robots/,"With a pioneering warehouse data intelligence system based on AI and autonomous mobile robots, BotsAndUs has just raised over €12.3 million. The UK-based startup is using its disruptive tech to streamline warehouse operations and logistics. Warehouse logistics are a critical part of keeping the global supply chain moving. With the boom in ecommerce, warehouses are under increasing pressure to keep up with demand and operate efficiently. Helping them do so, BotsAndUs has just secured fresh funding in a round led by Lakestar, with participation from Maersk Growth, Kindred Capital, and Capnamic Ventures. Founded in 2015, BotsAndUs’ pioneering warehouse data intelligence system captures real-time insights using fully-autonomous, mobile robots and AI, helping companies drive better business decisions. The rapid increase in demand for near-instantaneous storage, dispatch, and delivery of goods is placing enormous time and cost pressures on companies, who now need to rethink and enhance their logistics and storage operations. According to Logistics Management data, at least 69% of companies are currently looking to improve their inventory control, as a more specific action to lower costs. BotsAndUs’ mobile robots are able to quickly process pallets at every stage in their journey throughout the warehouse. Triggered by the arrival of trucks, the robots capture the volume and condition of goods to check them in as they enter the warehouse, and also check them out as they leave the warehouse. The same robots scan goods on shelves and record their location and quantity. This deep tech innovation blends a fleet of state-of-the-art autonomous robots, with unique navigation, vision systems, and AI. It means they can operate in the warehouse without human intervention, digitising the warehouse without the need to make additional investments in infrastructure. As a result, the startup argues that its robots will save time and protect revenues by eliminating manual dimensioning and stock checking; ultimately allowing managers to have full and real-time visibility of their operations from the comfort of their desks. Co-founder and CEO, Andrei Danescu, explained: “BotsAndUs is already paving the way for artificial intelligence and robotics to completely transform logistics, and this new financing only reaffirms our vision. It’s incredibly exciting to know that our integrated AI and robotics platform is helping companies boost their performance and unlock their full potential. By providing state-of-the-art autonomous robotics and a proprietary AI platform, we’re confident we can make our vision a reality: transforming logistics on a global scale with real time data to eliminate errors and enhance performance across all steps.” The UK-based startup is already trusted by a number of clients representing core industries, including Menzies Aviation, Huboo and Maersk. BotsAndUs aims to be the go-to robotics provider for supply chains across almost every industry, envisioning that its platform will help warehouse managers around the world. Lakestar Partner Christoph Schuh, commented: “More than 80% of warehouses have no automation at all. With warehouses expected to grow by 50% by 2025 and labour shortages of over 30%, automation clearly holds the key to ensuring logistics operations are as optimised as possible. BotsAndUs is unique in providing robots that capture real-time data, allowing warehouse operators to carry out their duties with little hindrance. We’re delighted to join the stellar team on their journey to transform logistics and enable companies to perform at their best.” Putting this new investment to use, BotsAndUs have planned to expand its robotics solution globally, placing an emphasis on building strong partnerships with industry leaders to accelerate growth. It is targeting markets including Germany, France, Nordics, USA, and Canada. The company is also seeking to expand its talent pool and grow its tech team, aiming to increase the size of the team to over 50 people by the end of 2022. Oliver Finch, Investment Partner, Maersk Growth, added: “We are delighted to back such a talented and inspiring team. BotsAndUs are tackling big opportunities in global logistics. Most warehouses have limited or no automation, and could benefit significantly from exploring this space. Many firms currently stretch the capacity of people and process in response to business challenges. BotsAndUs provides an easy on-ramp for warehouses to explore automation, enrich data and enable intelligent optimisation to utilise untapped capabilities from existing assets and teams.”"

2022.6.24,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/brussels-based-resortecs-receives-e2-5-million-grant-from-the-eu-to-accelerate-fashions-circular-transition/,"The Brussels-based fashiontech startup Resortecs has been selected to receive a grant worth €2.5 million from the EIC Accelerator. Founded in 2017, the startup enables industrial-scale recycling in fashion thanks to high-quality, automated garment disassembly. Currently, less than 1% of all clothing produced is recycled, largely due to the high costs and complexity in separating different textile materials prior to recycling. Resortecs set out to solve this issue with two patented innovations: Smart Stitch™, heat-dissolvable stitching threads, and Smart Disassembly™, an industrial oven capable of separating the different components of clothing made with Smart Stitch™, all without compromising the quality or creativity of clothing. Aligned with the EU efforts to accelerate circular fashion and progressively halt fast-fashion production, Resortecs is one of the 74 startups selected out of over 1,000 applicants in what is the most competitive funding round from the EIC Accelerator. The high-potential companies will each receive grants and/or equity investments, depending on their needs. Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth stated: “The new wave of innovation is currently led by deep tech startups that target societal challenges. I am happy to see so many of them applying to the EIC, in particular from countries that are catching up in their levels of research and innovation performance. Thanks to the European Innovation Council, they will get the support they need to accelerate their growth and lead on the next wave of deep tech.” Resortecs was founded by Cédric Vanhoeck and Vanessa Counaert, and in 2021 the young company had already raised over €1.8 million to fund R&D and start piloting their disassembly solution, now validated by over 30 global fashion giants. Winners of several awards – from the H&M Foundation Global Change Award in 2018 to the 2022 Female Founder Challenge organized by VivaTech and Société Générale just last week – the startup counts on renowned supporters, including La Maison des Startups LVMH in France, Desigual’s Awesome Lab in Spain, and the BMW Foundation’s RESPOND Accelerator in Germany. Cédric Vanhoeck, the Co-founder & Executive Lead of the startup commented: “We are thrilled to have been selected by the EIC. This sum is a stepping stone to close our current €5M fundraising round – the most ambitious so far. We want to double the team, produce new continuous disassembly systems and scale our thread production to answer the ramping demand for circular solutions coming from the EU textile industry.” Resortecs’ Smart Stitch™ has already been used in collections such as “Genesis” in collaboration with the American made-to-measure jeans brand Unspun and with H&M for the “Circular Design Story” capsule collection. A new partnership with Spanish giant Inditex is set to hit the stores this summer. By the end of the year, the French Decathlon will launch its first model with Resortecs’ thread: a fully circular ski jacket. To learn more about Resortecs, check out the video below:"

2022.6.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/paris-based-flowdesk-raises-e28-million-for-its-crypto-trading-solution/,"Joining the growing crypto market, Flowdesk has secured about €28 million for its digital asset infrastructure and trading platform. The company provides its solution for web3 players, including cryptocurrency token issuers. Founded in 2020 by Guilhem Chaumont, Paul Bugnot, François Cluzeau and Balthazar Giraux, Flowdesk is a digital asset service provider that is fueling interconnection in the crypto and digital asset market. The Paris-based startup just picked up around €28 million in new funding for its platform, marking a continued interest in this sector. Leading investors contributed to the funding, including Eurazeo, Aglaé Ventures, ISAI, Speedinvest, Fabric.vc, Ledger, and Coinbase, as well as 20 well-known business angels, including Alexandre Prot (Qonto), Nicolas Julia (Sorare), Pascal Gauthier (Ledger) and Sébastien Borget (The Sandbox). After working in the crypto market for some time, the founders discovered some gaps in the market, and the need for a more cohesive marketplace and infrastructure to facilitate the liquidity of crypto-asset projects. So, they decided to develop an infrastructure that would allow them to interconnect and trade on these exchanges while guaranteeing the scalability needed to support the booming crypto industry. Just like that, Flowdesk was developed. The fintech company represents a trading infrastructure that allows interconnection with more than 60 cryptocurrency exchange platforms. It offers four key services – asset management; brokerage; custody; and, market-making. The most differentiating product is the market-making capability. It addresses the needs of the majority of c cryptocurrency issuers with significant liquidity issues. By making its technology and traders available to these players, Flowdesk allows them to manage their cryptocurrency token liquidity themselves with their own funds. The service is called Market-Making-as-a-Service in reference to digital models based on simply providing technology to customers who commit their own resources. Thomas Turelier, Vice President at Eurazeo said: “An increasing number of companies are issuing tokens and are thus confronted with the complexity of managing a liquid asset in different markets. Most of these companies do not, however, see themselves as financial market professionals: they are technology providers, game developers… A financial infrastructure such as the one proposed by Flowdesk is therefore crucial to allow all these web3 players to develop with the least possible friction while trusting a regulated player aligned with its customers in terms of financial interests. ” While the crypto industry is continuing to grow at a rapid pace, so is Flowdesk. The company now employs 35 people and plans to grow to 100 by the end of 2022 – representing growing demand for its service. This new funding will support the fintech startup in its plans to grow and scale, as well as develop a complete platform for its clients. The aim is to enable users to carry out the simplest to the most complex trading operations themselves – a model that will contribute to Flowdesk’s position as a leader in Market-Making-as-a-Service. Guilhem Chaumont, co-founder and CEO of Flowdesk added: “This fundraising is a key step that will allow us to accelerate at all levels to meet the growing demand in Europe, Asia and North America. It will also give us the means to develop our technological infrastructure to meet the new needs that will emerge in market making. Our vision is that within 10 years a large proportion of assets will be tokenized using blockchain technology, which will require a rethinking of financial services with a more scalable and counterparty agnostic approach. We will have to scale up quickly to integrate this new financial situation.”"
2022.6.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/irish-startup-luminate-medical-picks-up-e4-7-million-to-tackle-the-side-effects-of-cancer-treatment/,"Medtech startup Luminate Medical has announced a fresh capital injection of about €4.7 million. The Irish startup is developing medical devices to eliminate the side effects of cancer treatment, improving patient outcomes and experiences. Cancer treatment has made incredible developments over the past few years. The disease, which sadly still impacts far too many of us, requires intensive treatments and therapies – which themselves come with various side effects and consequences. Aiming to eliminate the side effects, such as chemotherapy-induced hair loss, Luminate Medical has just received funding in grant financing and a seed round investment. The funding for the Galway-based team was led by Elkstone Capital, SciFounders, and Faber. Founded in 2018 by Aaron Hannon, Dr Barbara Oliveira and Professor Martin O’Halloran, Luminate Medical participated in the Y Combinator S21 Batch and has also received grant funding from Enterprise Ireland’s Disruptive Technology Innovation Fund. The medtech innovators are currently developing their first product – Lily. A portable head-covering device, the product prevents the delivery of chemotherapy drugs to the hair follicles in a comfortable and repeatable way. Current devices to prevent hair loss use scalp cooling therapy, which requires patients to remain in the clinic for hours after treatment under extremely cold temperatures to prevent chemotherapy from attacking the hair follicles. Luminate Medical’s product, however, enables a portable, comfortable and effective solution to prevent hair loss. The Lily device enables patients to purchase and access hair loss treatment directly and will eliminate the requirement for patients to remain in the clinic after chemotherapy treatment. Barbara Oliveira, CTO and Co-Founder of Luminate Medical, said: “Our mission is to revolutionise the user experience of healthcare. We do that by building medical devices with a patient-first approach and focusing on the needs that truly matter to patients.” This new funding will be used by the startup to complete the first in-patient clinical trials of its Lily device in Europe and the US in 2022 and 2023, alongside expanding its R&D team with roles in biomedical engineering, finite element analysis and product design. Clinical trial sites for the product include the company’s home in Galway, Ireland. Based on this clinical data, the company anticipates engaging with the FDA for product clearance in 2023. Sofia Santos, Partner at Faber said: “Our conviction in Luminate Medical’s mission comes from the way the team envisions the use of data to solve a problem that has been ignored by the traditional medical device industry. Improving cancer patients’ quality of life and care along their treatment journey is an underestimated field where advanced technological development can add a lot of value.”"
2022.6.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/lisbon-based-faber-closes-climate-focused-fund-at-e32-million/,"Today, Portuguese VC firm Faber has launched its deep tech fund dedicated to boosting ocean sustainability and climate action innovation – Faber Blue Pioneers I. The fund has reached a total of €32 million, exceeding its initial target. Climate action is very much at the forefront of European innovation in 2022, and it’s comforting to see this continue to be the case. There’s no doubt that European startups are generating some fascinating solutions and innovations to tackle the greatest challenge of our time. But, startups need one thing to help them develop these ideas into actionable solutions – capital. Lisbon-based VC firm, Faber, has launched a fund to do exactly that. Establishing itself as Southern Europe’s first VC fund specializing in deep tech for ocean sustainability and climate action, the fund has reached €32 million and has already made its first investment – supporting German cleantech company Fuelsave. Faber Blue Pioneers I Faber Blue Pioneers I is backed by impact-driven institutional investors such as the EIF and Portugal Blue, Sociedade Francisco Manuel dos Santos, Builders Initiative, Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and Champalimaud Foundation as well as by successful entrepreneurs such as Peter Rive (co-founder SolarCity, now part of Tesla) and Pedro Bizarro (co-founder Feedzai). With sustainability programmes at the forefront of the fund’s aims, the investors represent a select group who want to support and contribute to a positive impact on ocean sustainability and climate action. Faber envisions amplifying this group further, with additional investors joining the fundi’s final closing by the end of 2022. Faber combines a specialized focus on deep tech early-stage (pre-seed and seed) startups with thematic funds, dedicated investment teams and expert advisors who actively work with entrepreneurs to build global companies using AI and data for ocean and climate technologies. This fund has the ambition of investing in a portfolio of 20 to 25 early-stage companies developing innovative deep-tech solutions with global ambition. Areas such as blue biotechnology, food and feed, ocean health, ocean intelligence, or the decarbonization of multiple industries are key priorities – all refelcting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The Team The new fund is managed by a dedicated investment team led by Rita Sousa, Carlos Esteban (fund Partners) and Bruno Ferreira (Venture Partner), combining extensive investment, entrepreneurial and technical track records. The team will work closely with a specialized network of expert advisors, including senior strategic advisor Tiago Pitta e Cunha (CEO of Oceano Azul Foundation) and scientific lead advisors Susana Moreira and Joana Moreira da Silva (Science and Innovation Officers of Ciimar) among other scientists, founders and industry experts. The investment team, based between Lisbon and Barcelona, has already analysed more than 600 startups from all over Europe. Committed to supporting southern European innovation, the focus is on projects coming from the Iberian province, and those looking to extend operations into the region. The fund’s first investment is the German cleantech startup Fuelsave, which focuses on the decarbonization of the maritime industry, and Faber has more investments in the pipeline to be completed during the next few weeks. Alexandre Barbosa, Faber’s Managing Partner, said: “It is with great pride that we announce the first close of Faber Blue Pioneers I above the initial target with such a notable group of impact-driven investors, joining us in the strong belief that science- and purpose-driven entrepreneurs can accelerate innovation and make a positive impact on ocean sustainability and climate action. It is also with great satisfaction that we welcome Fuelsave to the fund’s portfolio, as we believe their team will pave the way for the decarbonization of the maritime industry.”"
2022.6.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/combining-empathy-with-technology-to-enhance-ccaas-the-secret-to-customer-success-sponsored/,"Ensuring excellent customer service is a crucial part of success for any B2C business. Having renowned customer service can fuel your sales funnel, ensure customer longevity and enhance your company’s reputation. Today, more and more teams are working remotely, and consumers are increasingly connecting with businesses online rather than in-person. The result is that a new approach to customer service is needed. In the past, a friendly face could make a big difference during a customer interaction, but now, we are firmly in the age of dealing with customer issues via the phone or online. Leading this new type of customer service is the need to design customer experiences with empathy and openness in mind – promoting this is the foundation for successful CCaaS (Contact Centre-as-a-Service) solutions. Brands and companies can reconnect with customers through fundamental compassion, empathy and expertise. These are the values that are helping contact centre solutions thrive and be successful.  To make your customer contact empathetic and approachable, using an outsourced CCaaS solution could be the way forward. Companies like Odigo can ensure that your customers receive excellent standards of service. Odigo, a CCaaS industry leader in helping organisations improve their customer satisfaction scores and achieving a more rewarding customer experience, has found there are three core values that should be at the centre of customer contact: Humanity, Commitment, Openness. Humans are front and centre Regardless of the service, dealing with customers needs to lead with the recognition that humans should be front and centre of the approach. AI and tech can help with this. For example, by helping reduce agent fatigue or burnout from listening to repetitive and demanding queries, it can be used to apply speech recognition tools. AI-led bot services can also guide a customer to resolution and bypass the need for call queues and agent involvement. Intelligent use of AI-led services and automation can help put the needs of the customer first. The increased convenience of these services can also help deflect routine, repetitive tasks so agents can engage with empathy in the more complex ones that bring greater job satisfaction. Complete Integration A good CCaaS solution can integrate individual customer interactions into a 360-degree customer view. It can also integrate with other complementary technologies to enhance customer experiences in line with a company’s long-term plans. Using a CCaaS solution can increase loyalty by offering customers greater personalisation and value when they interact with an organisation. CCaaS is just one piece of the puzzle though, agents and a supportive contact centre culture also help put human-centric values at the heart of customer service.  Odigo – more than CCaaS solutions Odigo is a leading provider of Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solutions which facilitate communication between large organisations and individuals. Its innovative approach is based on holistically combining empathy with tech to enable brands to connect with the crucial human element of interaction while also taking full advantage of digital possibilities. A pioneer of customer experience, with roots hailing back to 1986, the company is already helping more than 250 clients in over 100 countries enhance customer experiences.

2022.6.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/uk-based-magical-mushroom-company-scores-e3-4-million-for-its-plant-based-sustainable-packaging/,"Unleashing the magic of mushrooms, UK-based startup Magical Mushroom Company has scored over €3.4 million in fresh funding. The startup is on a mission to tackle the growing plastic problem through nature-based alternatives. Plastic pollution is one of the largest challenges of our time. Sadly, seeing plastic thrown away carelessly, polluting parks, streets, water systems, and beyond is more common than not. One of the biggest contributors? The overuse of plastic to package goods and products. Tackling this, by harnessing the magic held in mushrooms, UK-based Magical Mushroom Company has developed biodegradable packaging alternatives – aiming to tap into the multi-billion euro European polystyrene packaging market. Leading the Seed round (over €3.4 million) was Ecovative Design LLC with participation by Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity – the world’s first green energy company; Robert Del Naja, the renowned activist – artist and musician; and Marcus Watson – co-founder of Adoreum Partners, who brought 30 investors in. It’s reported that global plastic waste more than doubled from 2000 to 2019 to 353 million tonnes with 40% of that waste coming from packaging. Meanwhile, research suggests that 90% of public sustainability claims will not be met by 2025 with the majority of companies remaining reliant on single-use packaging. Magical Mushroom Company’s solution is a direct replacement for plastic-based packaging, such as polystyrene and cardboard, and has the potential to remove them entirely from global supply chains. Founded in 2019, Magical Mushroom Company puts agricultural waste to work by combining it with mycelium – the root structure of a mushroom. The startup creates a material that is biodegradable, durable and comparable in price to traditional packaging derived from fossil fuels like polystyrene. Unlike other compostable packaging, the product breaks down naturally in the ground in around 45 days without any additional chemicals or industrial facilities. Paul Gilligan, CEO & founder at Magical Mushroom Company, explained: “We have just eight years to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and businesses have a crucial role to play – but they need viable and cost-effective solutions that significantly reduce the carbon footprint across their entire supply chain. We’re proud to be creating value from waste and unlocking the potential of mycelium – a resource that has been untapped to date. We’re delighted to have the support of a brilliant group of investors who have a wealth of experience in driving sustainable change and share our vision for the future of packaging solutions. The magic of mushrooms is only just being realised and we can’t wait to make it mainstream.” Already the company is serving clients from international brands such as Raymarine, BA Components, Castrads, Ffern, Selfridges, Lush, Seedlip and ID Watch. This investment will be used to fund the opening of Magical Mushroom Company’s first raw material production plant – due to open in Beeston, Nottinghamshire. It will allow the startup to gain control of the entire packaging manufacturing process and create new jobs. The funding will also be used to implement automation upgrades at the company’s existing packaging plants in the UK and Bulgaria to scale production as well as lower costs. Thomas Van Haren, Director of MycoComposites at Ecovative Design LLC added: “The packaging industry is ripe for change and innovative solutions must be supported so that we can move away from our reliance on fossil fuels. In the Magical Mushroom Company, a viable alternative already exists that is producing high-quality sustainable packaging on an industrial scale. Paul and his team have made incredible progress in a short period of time as demonstrated with the opening of their latest high-tech plant in the UK. We were inspired by their vision to scale the business and we’re looking forward to supporting their mission to help remove polystyrene packaging from manufacturing supply chains.”"

Cloud-based call centre and phone system provider Aircall has just announced that it has passed $100 million (€94.4 million) in Annual Recurring Revenue – just one year after it hit unicorn valuation. The French startup, founded in 2014, has been on our radar for a while – having pioneered phone systems for modern business. It’s been a skyrocketing company and this new announcement gives further credence to its innovative solution. We chatted to CEO and Co-Founder Olivier Pailhes back in 2018 to learn about the impressive growth story of the company and what was in store for the future. Back then, reaching centaur status wasn’t mentioned, but it was clear this startup had a promising future. In fact, just two years after we were able to get in touch with the team again with news of a Series C raise of €59.2 million. Now, the team of over 700 are based in offices across the world, including New York, Paris, Sydney, Berlin, and London. Aircall’s aim is to make voice conversations more valuable and more connected. The system boasts a simple set-up and has simple integrations (with Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Slack, Intercom and more), meaning that it can help companies across industries of various sizes. In the past couple of years, businesses around the globe have had to majority rethink operations with remote working and the swift movement to digitization. It has meant that there’s been an increased need for innovative ways to communicate effectively – and Aircall has stepped up to the plate. Aircall’s platform makes phone systems easy to manage, prioritising three pillars of accessibility, transparency and collaboration. The overarching belief is that a great conversation is the best way to communicate with customers, prospects, candidates, and colleagues – and this shouldn’t be hindered by distance. Olivier Pailhès, Aircall co-founder and CEO said: “We’ve seen businesses worldwide evaluating the current economic environment and increasingly looking for simple phone systems and call center softwares that are easy to implement and increase efficiency and productivity, but also improve the quality of their customer experience. We’re delighted to reach this milestone as a company, as it represents the continued value we bring to customers around the world and helps further our mission of empowering every professional to have richer conversations.” With this announcement, Aircall also boasts a 70% YoY growth in revenue and a 107% YoY increase in large customers. And there are no plans of slowing things down. The startup will now maintain its growth by focusing on fundamentals – continuing to enrich its marketplace to empower every professional to have richer conversations. The Aircall ecosystem currently integrates with more than 100 leading business tools, including Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Teams, Intercom and more. It will keep scaling up investment in R&D with plans to focus on addressing bigger customers in the mid-market segment. Aircall’s growth relies strongly on internationalization, and following the success of its North America headquarters, the company continues to open new offices in cities around the globe, with plans to expand in Singapore and Madrid later this year. Jonathan Anguelov, Aircall co-founder and General Manager added: “We’re very proud of reaching this milestone just 6 years after our first million dollars of revenue. This is a strong indication of the worldwide demand for technology solutions. Reaching $100m ARR is an important metric, and it offers a valuable perspective on how Aircall is performing in a volatile market. It also brings us a step closer to public scale. After opening offices in Australia, UK and Germany, we’re excited to continue our expansion worldwide and keep building a team that is pushing what cloud-based phone solutions can offer.”"
2022.6.28,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/european-founders-launch-plural-a-e250-million-fund-building-the-next-generation-of-tech-startups/,"Set up for founders by founders Plural has launched today. The €250 million investment platform is looking to build the next generation of European tech companies that can make a global impact. Europe’s tech startup ecosystem has been soaring. Last year, the space saw the highest levels of capital raised ever, and, this year we are still seeing big fundraises, acquisitions and partnerships – despite some uncertainty floating around. However, while Europe’s startups are growing and innovating, the continent is still lagging far behind the US. Recognised and influential founders in Europe’s startup community, Ian Hogarth, Khaled Helioui, Sten Tamkivi and Taavet Hinrikus, believe this is because European investors lack the founder experience. They point to the fact that in the US, over half of venture General Partners have founder experience while in Europe it is just 8%. Taavet Hinrikus explained: “We’re the investors we would have liked to have when we were building our own companies. Founding a company is a craft and the best way to learn that craft is to work alongside those who have done it before.” Launching Plural Aiming to tackle this head-on and support a new generation of innovators and entrepreneurs, the founders have launched Plural – a new €250 million investment fund. It’s a scalable investment platform whose investors are exclusively former founders and operators with decades of company-building experience. Plural’s founders believe that the scar tissue from building tech companies is invaluable in helping the next generation of founders to build companies with global potential. Ian Hogarth elaborated: ‘We call experienced founders ‘unemployables’, because once you’ve experienced the intense authorship that comes with creating something new it’s hard to work for anyone again. We created Plural to give unemployables a place to call home and put their entrepreneurial energy behind missions and founders they deeply believe in.” Between them, the founders Taavet, Sten, Ian and Khaled have founded four startups – Wise, Songkick, Teleport and Certific – and played a significant role in building three companies, including Skype, Bigpoint and Topia. All four operators-turned-investors have also been angel investing for years, with significant success. Companies in their portfolio include Deliveroo, Hopin, Pipedrive, Chorus, Uber, Zego and Bolt. Clearly, they have a wealth of experience to draw on and share in building impactful companies. At Plural, they have already invested in 14 companies including Feather, NFTport an NFT infrastructure company, energy storage company Field, metaverse company Ready Player Me and student banking challenger MOS. Plural’s Plans The aim of the fund is to become hands-on investors, focusing on leading early-stage rounds between €1 and €10 million. Each investor will focus on 3-5 deals a year, meaning they can dedicate more time to each respective startup. The team want to connect current and experienced founders to enhance the potential of those who have the vision and drive to create and build global companies. Essentially, they are on the lookout for exciting founders who may otherwise get passed over in the traditional investment process. Khaled Helioui said: “So much opportunity is left untapped today as uncommon founders fail to meet standard investors’ pattern recognition criteria. Sadly investors lack the risk appetite needed to fulfill founders’ ambitions and the full extent of the impact those founders is not realised. There is so much potential to unlock, especially in Europe, if we change the funding mechanisms that still act as conservative gatekeepers today.” While the fund will focus on category-defining founders tackling important missions, the main verticals the founders have experience in include; opportunity gap reduction; mitigating climate change; the future of governance; and, improving health. Sten Tamkivi concluded: “We are huge optimists for the potential of technology coming from Europe which can benefit the whole world, as well as improve the lives of people across the continent. We’ve already seen the real impact a well-funded startup scene can have on economies in small countries like Estonia — now it is time to scale this GDP level impact across the whole of Europe.”"
2022.6.28,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/paris-based-spinergie-sets-sail-with-e11-million-for-its-maritime-management-platform/,"French startup Spinergie has just secured €11 million in Series A funding and sets sail to become a maritime tech market leader. The company is developing a smart fleet management platform specialising in emission reduction, vessel performance and operation optimization for the sector. The maritime industry is incredibly important for our global world – and it historically has been. However, it is an industry that is in dire need of digitisation and needs to pick up the pace. Digitisation is needed to help maritime operators better manage processes and improve performance, as well as to reduce the environmental impacts of the sector. Founded in Paris in 2016, Spinergie is aiming to do just that – transforming marine data into environmental impact and operational efficiencies. The startup has now secured €11 million in a new funding round led by Iris Capital and Swen Capital’s Blue Ocean fund, alongside key investors and business angels that include Polytechnique Ventures, Sanne Manders, COO of Flexport, Jean-Gabriel Levon, cofounder of Ynsect, and Antoine de Chassy, founder of Loft Orbital. The brains behind the company, Jean Cristofari (CEO) and Louis Jozon (CPO), developed the platform based on their respective expertise in the offshore industry and fleet optimisation/management. The company’s solution offers accurate real-time operations tracking and benchmarking. It’s powered by millions of data points and leverages proprietary algorithms and industry knowledge to generate operation and vessel-specific recommendations. Digitizing an industry The maritime industry has been crying out for innovation and new tech developments. On an environmental level, digitisation is now an essential step to bring the sector in line with climate goals. Louis Jozon, Spinergie CPO and co-founder, explained:“Decarbonizing the maritime industry is an enormous and incredibly complex challenge that requires a collaborative approach through industry partnerships and the most advanced technologies. We are developing the best possible products, connecting previously siloed data, facilitating interoperability between systems and providing recommendations.” Shipping emissions account for approx 1 gigaton of CO2 per year and are expected to contribute to up to 17% of global GHG emissions by 2050 if it is not tackled quickly. Decarbonisation remains the biggest long-term challenge facing the industry and will require digital solutions to track and reduce emissions through operational efficiencies. However, most operations are still followed up and managed on spreadsheets – which just isn’t leveraging data in the most productive or efficient way. Stricter monitoring and reporting will be quickly needed to comply with new international regulations such as IMO DCS or EU MRV and to stay on a pathway consistent with the Paris Agreement and the COP26 adopted in 2018. Spinergie Solutions Maritime Market Intelligence, Spinergie’s first solution, allows vessel managers and charterers to search and select a vessel anywhere in the world according to vessel specs, availability, and past performances. It analyses vessel environmental and operational performances, allowing commercial and operational teams to have more visibility of their competitors and suppliers across the globe. Mélanie Le Guen, Principal at Blue Ocean added:“SWEN Capital Partners through its Blue Ocean fund is delighted to support Spinergie in pioneering digital solutions to help the maritime industry improve its operations, especially to reduce GHG emissions. If the shipping industry was a country, it would be the sixth-largest polluter in the world. We, therefore, need such highly scalable solutions to accelerate the transition of this industry. We will share our expertise and networks on ocean impact and the maritime industry to help Spinergie achieve its ambition and impact at a global scale.” In 2021, Spinergie launched Smart Fleet Management, a solution suite enabling clients to monitor and optimize maritime operations (offshore wind, dredging, and bulk shipping among others). It provides real-time visibility, performance analysis and recommendations such as fuel consumption and emissions by activity mode, operational metrics and time analysis. The solution allows teams to anticipate and better manage their operations while automating regulatory reporting. The Spinergie platform has been developed with maritime players in mind – it’s easy to use, and highly connected to existing systems and embedded sensors, making integrations as swift as possible. The vision is to use tech to make the industry more transparent, sustainable and efficient – and it’ll be simple to implement. Jean Cristofari, Spinergie CEO & Co-Founder, explained: “This announcement comes at a critical time for the industry as maritime carbon emissions continue to rise and new regulations will revolutionize the way industry leaders plan their operations. We have ambitious goals and are delighted to welcome Iris and Swen as our first investors in Spinergie. They combine Technology and Maritime environmental expertise to help us bring widescale change in how our industry operates.” Future Plans Already the Spinergie solution is serving global maritime leaders including vessel managers and charterers companies such as Orsted, GE, Boskalis, and Nexans to help them measure, benchmark and optimize their vessels’ performance and maritime operations to significantly improve their environmental impact. Moving forward, the funding will accelerate Spinergie’s growth by deepening its market leadership position in offshore wind and enabling them to further expand into shipping sectors. Specifically, it will support R&D programmes, the recruitment of new team members, especially data scientists and developers, and growing the global client-facing team with the opening of new offices in Asia, South America and the Middle East. The company will triple its team size by end of 2023."
2022.6.28,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/london-based-screenloop-secures-e6-6-million-for-its-platform-fueling-better-hiring-decisions/,"Innovation in recruitment tech is growing at a fast pace at the moment and Screenloop is a startup pushing the momentum forward. The startup just secured €6.6 million for its hiring intelligence platform that builds a better team by removing bias. Poor hiring choices. Labour shortages. Recruitment bias. Talent mismatches. Poor hiring experiences. These are all phrases and themes that have dominated the recruitment space in Europe recently. For candidates as much as companies, the hiring process has become tiresome, stressful, and, ineffective. It’s a phenomenon that is resulting in a talent shortage, costly hiring decisions and inefficient use of time. Shaking up hiring processes Founded in 2021 by Anton Boner, Jay Radia, João Leal, Nuno Saldanha and Rodrigo Santos, Screenloop is aiming to flip the hiring game upside down – with the aim of enabling companies to hire high-quality talent and candidates to have an enhanced experience. The London-based startup has just picked up €6.6 million in fresh funding and is growing fast. This newly announced seed round was led by Stride VC with participation from Ludlow Ventures, All Iron Ventures, Passion Capital and angel investor Paul Forster, founder of job-seeking platform Indeed. It comes after a capital raise of €2.2 million at the end of 2021. The founders behind Screenloop came together with the mission to enhance hiring processes based on their own individual experiences. As many successful founders will note, building a startup from a place of passion is crucial, and the team certainly have it. The founding team experienced shared frustrations and poor hiring experiences whilst working as senior operators at fast-growth tech businesses. This, combined with the knowledge that a reported 95% of businesses have admitted to making bad hiring decisions, inspired a move to make a change. Anton Boner, Co-Founder and Commercial Director, said: “Our team is united in the belief that hiring is inefficient, outdated and unfair to candidates around the world. We have all been hiring managers and candidates, and we know the hiring process is broken. It’s difficult to track and measure, meaning there’s a lack of insight into what to improve and what to prioritise. Companies struggle to replicate their top performers and the cost of a failed hire is over $180,0001.” How it works Screenloop’s end-to-end hiring intelligence platform uses data and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify gaps in the recruitment process, leverage candidate feedback, and provide real-time coaching for interviewers to conduct better interviews and remove unconscious bias from decision-making. Currently, the product includes four key solutions, let’s take a look. ‘Pulse’ enables automated candidate feedback on the organisation’s recruitment processes and uses it to identify and provide tailored recommendations for improvement using AI – enabling businesses to hit their hiring goals faster. ‘Interview training’ provides modern shadowing and real-time coaching through AI to enable interviewers to ask better questions as well as remove subjectiveness and unconscious bias in decision making. ‘Interview Intelligence’ allows businesses to collaborate quicker and therefore make decisions more rapidly. It reportedly allowed one customer to hire the top candidates in their process faster with a decrease of 26% in time to offer. ‘Success’ is Screenloop’s tech-enabled take on the highly manual referencing process which is outdated and inefficient. Success allows companies to understand more about the soft skills of their new hires and completes the reference process in less than 24 hours. The technology allows new hires to contribute faster in their new position and reduces the likelihood of failed probations. Anton Boner explained further: “Screenloop reduces the likelihood of companies making a bad hire whilst also helping remove unconscious bias from the recruitment process. We want to ensure candidates have an amazing interview experience with every company and are treated fairly. We also want to empower companies with data, insights and actions to be able to make the best hiring decisions all the time.” Jay Radia, Co-Founder and Chair of Screenloop, added: “We have built a platform that can help all businesses to achieve their hiring goals faster by creating a world-class candidate experience. 80% of employee turnover is due to bad hiring decisions4 which we help businesses avoid through our platform. By focusing on experience, companies can attract, hire and retain the best candidates around and build a more diverse team at the same time.” Milestones and Plans So far, the recruitment innovators have onboarded customers representing fast-growth tech companies such as TrueLayer, Beamery, Reachdesk and GorillaLogic. The company also reports that it has been able to reduce the average time to hire by three days – an amazing feat in this increasingly challenging sector. Looking forward, this latest funding will be used for continued product investment plus research and development, with the goal of delivering a powerful end-to-end hiring intelligence platform. Screenloop will also continue its expansion into the US and new markets. The Screenloop team is growing with key hires being made across sales, marketing and engineering. Gabbi Cahane, Partner at Stride VC, said: “From the moment we met the team, we could see they had a unique combination of vision, experience and technical chops to pull off such an ambitious project. In the war for talent, when candidates’ expectations are growing ever higher, it’s fundamental that companies can provide them with an experience that is empowering, engaging and effective. Whether they’re hiring to grow or to fill the gaps, they need a recruitment process that’s fit for purpose, and that’s exactly where Sceenloop becomes indispensable.”"

2022.6.29,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/digitising-the-experience-economy-the-story-of-easol-the-all-in-one-experience-commerce-platform/,"Founded by husband and wife duo Lisa and Ben Simpson, Easol is described as an experience commerce platform, supporting actors in the experience market globally. The platform can help drive more direct sales, retain revenues, help operators take ownership of data and give insights and analysis. Essentially, it’s an all-in-one platform for the experience market. Born out of frustration with existing systems, the pair developed the platform after their experience running a snowsports and music festival – Rise. In the process, they found a lack of tools to manage the website, bookings and payments. So, they set up Easol in 2018 – a SaaS company exclusively for the experience economy – including events, festivals and tour operators. In 2021, the London-based startup multiplied the number of creators it works with by more than 10 and grew its customer base by 913%. Given the uniqueness of Easol, it’s no surprise it’s enjoyed such success in a short time, and we were curious to find out more about their secrets to success. Firstly, what’s the vision behind Easol? The founders explained: “The way the experience economy operates is outdated for creators today. The technology and software solutions that experience businesses must stitch together to be able to offer a variety of different booking, payment and activity options develops a working environment for creators that is complex, inflexible, and expensive. Creators lose control of the customer journey by having to hand over customers to third parties, valuable data is lost and ultimately the vision of a passionate creator ends up being compromised. The mission for Easol is to show experience businesses what is possible when you work with technology that was developed specifically with their needs in mind. We call this Experience Commerce, and it refers to an ecommerce environment where creators can fully realise their passions and deliver experiences for their customers that are authentic, good value, bespoke and how they intended them to be.” Easol, therefore, is giving much-needed control to players in the experience market. It’s an industry inherently marked by being present, being in the moment, but it’s inherently scattered. Experiences are always more popular the more tailored they can be. Therefore, digitizing has been a daunting task for most operators. But digitizing, as pointed out by the pair, is crucial for the industry to keep growing and providing the best experiences for travellers, guests and customers. Not only can digitisation open the door for more personalisation, but, in 2022, virtually every industry has gone digital.  The digital transformation has accelerated at an incredible pace, and was further pushed forward by the pandemic – it’s left no ma(n)rket behind. “The pandemic caused a shift in consumer buying behaviours – we know that consumers now expect greater flexibility and want to have full control over their options. We’ve also seen a rapid wave of digitalisation, with consumers now expecting instant and easy service. The rise of technology, and specifically the internet, has taken the travel industry by storm – gone are the times when travellers relied on travel agents to craft the perfect holiday. Processes such as planning trips, making bookings, taking payments and organising accommodation can now all be done online at the click of a button. The next step that we would expect to see in the travel industry is that these processes become more intuitive and integrated to make the customer experience more seamless – at present, travellers have to use several platforms and interfaces to book one trip.” We wanted to find out more about the core benefits of taking experiences digital.  Ben and Lisa shared their thoughts: “There are several really important reasons for digitising experiences and bringing them onto one integrated platform:  Creators can be confident that all changes to a booking follow through and are made on the front and the back end seamlessly. When flights are cancelled or people change their plans, making adjustments is accurate, quick and easy. Without this integrated platform, most creators find themselves having to update several systems which is time-consuming and an opportunity for costly errors to occur   With multiple systems at play, if a potential customer is taken to another portal to complete their booking, for example, to pay for the booking, and then doesn’t complete it for any reason, the creator has no way of connecting with that customer or retargeted them. All elements of the trip booking taking place on one platform means that the customer, and their data, all stay in one place for the creator to manage which has huge implications for their ability to run and build their business.   For the end customer, the whole experience of booking is much smoother, there are no third-party websites and optional extras can be presented at the right time for the trip being offered. Ultimately, taking this approach means that people are empowered to create totally unique, personalised experiences based on their interests and what they enjoy.”  Now, in 2022, the travel industry and experience economy are back up and running. Prices for hotels, activities, travel options, and so forth, have all skyrocketed this year in a firm statement that Europe’s appetite for travel is back.  While the appetite for travel is back, tastes may have changed. “People’s priorities have shifted, and personalisation is taking centre stage – we’re seeing more and more people seeking authentic, unique experiences. From destinations and accommodation to activities and food, people want to tailor every aspect of their experience to their preferences. Experiential travel is emerging as an antidote to mass packaged tourism – people want to broaden their minds, challenge themselves outside our comfort zones, meet people from different backgrounds and achieve a sense of personal transformation. Similarly, in an increasingly digitised world, people are seeking authenticity and real connection with like-minded people. Easol empowers experience creators to offer highly personalised experiences with the degree of seamlessness and flexibility that today’s customers have come to expect and value.” Easol’s platform is a pioneering product. Bringing the ability for experienced operators to pull together the full spectrum of operations and processes into one place is providing an innovative and hotly-demanded tool to the market and it’s certainly shaking things up. It’s offering that much-needed personalisation to cater to new expectations and demands, and it’s helping experience providers capitalise on renewed interest in getting out and exploring the world. The core takeaways from their experience? “Know your audience – what are they looking for in an experience? What do they value? What motivates them to travel or spend money on an experience? Experience creators are experts in what they do, and often cater to niche audiences – it’s important to establish yourself as a specialist in this area, so customers seek you out. Offer flexibility in booking and payments – this has become a must-have rather than a nice-to-have, even more so since the pandemic. People’s plans are constantly changing, and in the current uncertainty, people are drawn to providers who offer low-commitment options such as deposit schemes and refunds. Equally, it’s important to offer a streamlined, seamless booking experience, and have a well-designed website and consistent social media presence that reflects your brand accurately.” Finally, we wanted to hear some words of wisdom from Ben and Lisa.  They shared that: “In the beginning, the most important thing is to be focused on the problem that you’re solving. Before you spend any money or start building anything, just really try and understand the challenges or issues that you’re looking to change. The first step of any founder’s journey is identifying the problem, and who you’re solving it for – there’s no point building out your idea if there isn’t a market for it. Once you’ve figured out your audience, it’s time to double down and really work out how you’re going to achieve success, and this means working with the people you’re trying to solve the problem for. Immerse yourself in their worlds as much as you can and talk to them as much as you can to figure out the best way to help them out. Finally, be frugal – super, super frugal – and try to remember to have fun along the way!”"
2022.6.29,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/paris-based-startup-sonio-secures-e5-million-to-optimize-prenatal-care-and-treatment/,"Taking Artificial Intelligence into prenatal care, French startup Sonio has just secured €5 million in new funding. The startup’s pioneering tech guides practitioners during prenatal ultrasounds to optimize treatment and diagnosis. Women’s health is still a massively under-funded and under-researched area. One major implication of this is the treatment and care available for pregnant women – impacting both the expectant mother and children. On a mission to empower fetal medicine professionals to secure pregnancy care, Paris-based startup Sonio has itself secured a fresh €5 million. The capital boost was led by Elaia, alongside OneRagtime and Bpifrance. Founded in 2020 by entrepreneurs (Cécile Brosset, Dagmar Nuber) and scientific (Rémi Besson, Stéphanie Allassonnière, Erwan Le Pennec), medical (Yves Ville, Julien Stirnemann, Emmanuel Spaggiari) and tech experts (David Amouyal, Deepak Prakash), Sonio leverages 5 years of R&D and clinical development at Ecole Polytechnique, the Prairie Institute and Necker Hospital in Paris. It’s a team that brings together unique expertise from the fields of fetal medicine, artificial intelligence, software development and imaging – taking a holistic approach to improving medical outcomes. It’s reported that 50% of congenital malformations are not detected before birth, and this is what Sonio wants to address. It provides a unique AI software that provides prenatal medicine practitioners with all types of medical, imaging, genetic and environmental data to optimize prenatal screening and diagnosis – a game-changer for the sector. Already, the solution is being used by 150 healthcare professionals in Europe – able to assist beginners to the most seasoned medical practitioners. The startup has also secured several partnerships with the likes of Samsung France (ultrasound manufacturer), as well as with private clinics such as PointGyn (OneClinic) in France and GynEcho in Canada. Moving forward, Sonio wants to continue its mission of bringing a positive impact to the medical world. This new funding will enable the team to add embedded image recognition into the Sonio platform, provide a boost to plans to enter the US and get FDA clearance, and, it will help ramp up the sales process in Europe. Cécile Brosset, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Sonio, said: “Sonio addresses very important issues for both pregnant women and fetal medicine practitioners with a unique combination of artificial intelligence and clinical expertise. This new round of financing will allow us to recruit the talents we need both in software development and sales, and bring to the market our full suite of products.” Stéphanie Hospital, Founder and CEO at OneRagtime, added: “At OneRagtime, we have been seduced by Sonio’s vision to leverage artificial intelligence to improve pregnant women’s health and empower practitioners in prenatal screening and diagnosis. We are proud to support the company in its roadmap and commercial expansion across Europe and the US. We are fully convinced by the team’s experience and ability to execute this innovative business and become the reference in prenatal care.”"

2022.6.29,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/london-based-birdie-raises-e28-4-million-to-support-more-personalised-home-care-for-the-elderly/,"Leading home-health platform Birdie aims to empower more personalised care for the elderly in the comfort of their own homes. The startup has just raised an additional €28.4 million in Series B funding to push forward the vision. Amidst a crisis in the home care sector, UK-based startup Birdie is attempting to alleviate the burden on care professionals whilst also giving elderly people the access to care and support they need from the comfort of their own homes. It’s a much-needed endeavour that is having a positive impact on the lvies of both the older generation and carers alike. To illustrate this further – the news just as it has been reported that in England alone, about half a million people are waiting for help as careers are leaving the role en masse due to pay losses. The startup has just secured an additional €24.8 million in its mission to reinvent home health care through tech, with Sofina leading the round alongside OMERS Ventures and follow-on investment coming from Index Ventures. Founded in 2017, Birdie operates on the ethos that the elder generation should have vibrant and happy lives as they age in the comfort of their own home. Not only is this undoubtedly better for their mental health, but it also decreases the strain on families and an already frazzled hospital care system. On the investment, Max Parmentier, co-founder and CEO of Birdie, said: “Our vision has always been to create a world where everyone can age with confidence at home. In five years, we have become the operating system for care providers, building the largest home healthcare dataset for the elderly in Europe. With millions of clinical data points collected each month, we plan on deriving personalised and predictive insights to enable a value-based healthcare delivery model. This latest investment, just over one year from the last round, is not only a validation of Birdie’s growth trajectory, but also an endorsement for the potential of our social impact.” The healthtech solution comprises an all-in-one platform that supports millions of care visits every month. It equips care providers with the tools they need to deliver better quality care and improve efficiency across most day-to-day operations. From scheduling visits, creating care plans, preparing audit reports and invoicing to full-service care management, the platform enables professionals to deliver care safely and efficiently. It further decreases the time spent on non-critical admin and relieves stressed-out workers of labour some paperwork. With a 91% increase in the number of people waiting to receive care across the UK, Birdie is fundamentally transforming the care system, helping care communities identify early points of intervention. In the last year alone, the startup reports a 200% increase in demand as care providers came under enormous pressure to run an efficient care operation with staffing constraints. Helen, a care professional at Alina Homecare, said: “Previously, we were writing long paragraphs and updates, but now it just takes 5 minutes to complete each visit note on the app. If there is a concern that can’t be actioned during the visit, the office will follow up on the client’s needs right away. The best part is that throughout all of this, family members have peace of mind that their loved one is being looked after, as they can track the care being received through the family app.” The SaaS solution operates with the principle of collaboration and also facilitates information sharing with both health practitioners and care communities for delivering personalised, preventative care at home. Currently, the startup is working with over 700 care businesses, including Alina Homecare, Medacs Healthcare and Care at Home Group. The platform supports 35,000 care recipients and 8,000 family members who now have access to vital information about their loved ones. This funding will mean that even more care recipients and family members can have more peace of mind bout the care they will get. It means that care workers can get back to doing what they’re really passionate about – providing care and support. This new funding will be used to support international expansion, impacting millions of lives. Harold Boël, CEO of Sofina, commented: “The home healthcare tech sector seems ripe for an innovative leader like Birdie to catalyse the necessary social change. Aligned with our strategy to back growing and sustainable businesses, we’re excited to join them on their mission to enrich the lives of millions of older adults through preventive and personalised care at home.” Stéphane Kurgan, Venture Partner of Index Ventures, added: “What really sets Birdie apart is the combination of an intuitive product experience coupled with a true partnership approach to digital transformation. We continue to be impressed by the team’s passion, calibre and commitment to social change and are proud to accompany them on their quest to reinvent care for the better.”"
2022.6.29,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/prague-based-4trans-picks-up-e18-million-to-improve-access-to-the-financial-world-for-europes-hauliers/,"Czech fintech startup 4Trans is on a mission to transform how logistics and supply chain companies use and access financial products. The company, hitting a niche and much-underserved target market, has just scored €18 million in new funding. Keeping up with the increasing demand for goods and products to be supplied across Europe is in the realm of supply chain and logistics companies. And it’s a cohort that has had a lot to keep up with recently. From a massive surge in ecommerce demand to supply chain crises and economic uncertainty, small and medium sized hauliers are struggling. An additional burden is a lack of access to finance and slow invoice payments – most existing financial insinuations don’t cater to the specific needs of this group. Aiming to plug the gap, and fuel better operations for Europe’s hauliers, 4Trans has just secured a fresh €18 million in equity and debt funding from backers including Atmos, Tera Ventures, and Lighthouse. Impact investment fund management firm based in the UK, Advance Global Capital has also extended a revolving credit facility to the firm. Founded in 2018, the Czech startup provides financial products for small and medium-sized companies operating in supply and logistics. Through its’ AI-driven factoring service, businesses are able to protect their finances by securing payment for their invoices upfront. By using data analysis and automation, 4Trans is able to do instant risk modelling and, as the service is fully digitalised, customers can receive payment of invoices of any size in five minutes – a monumental upgrade from the 3-month average companies currently face. Jaroslav Ton, CEO of 4Trans, explained: “The supply chain crisis alongside political and economic uncertainty has led to a huge increase in delays to invoices being paid. This has put considerable financial pressure on Europe’s small and medium sized hauliers. Unfortunately, most traditional financial institutions simply do not cater to this group and those that do take too long to provide financing or require very large invoices. We’ve created a range of solutions that give the small and independent entrepreneurs within the European supply chain the protection they need and deserve”. Clearly, the startup’s service is giving European hauliers a much-needed boost, but don’t just take our word for it. Looking at the numbers the startup is enjoying accelerated growth this year. In 2022, 4Trans’ customer base has grown to 500 and monthly revenue has increased 1–fold on the back of the unfolding supply chain crisis. The company further reports that to date, it has provided more than €30 million financings, protecting revenue from more than 50k invoices. Hadi Solh, Managing Partner at deep-tech-focused Atmos Ventures, said: “4Trans is a pioneer in AI-enabled risk assessment in supply chain financing. The speed at which the company is able to understand the real-time credit risk of the counterparties is unparalleled in trade finance-focused solutions in the market. We are confident that our investment will help 4Trans with increasing their international footprint.” This new funding will be used to strengthen operations within Czechia before expanding to Poland, as well as to develop the platform further and grow the international team. Michal Zalesak, Co-Founder of Lighthouse Ventures, added: “4Trans have created a solution that tackles a very real problem for Europe’s supply and logistics industry. Namely, there is very little financial protection for hauliers and SMEs”."

Barnaby Hussey-Yeo, Founder and CEO of Cleo, said: “We’re here to provide personalised financial support and guidance to these young people, giving them a helping hand as they seek to better manage their finances, build their credit profile and weather the storm caused by the cost-of-living crisis.” The idea is simple. By reaching people at the beginning of their financial journey with clear and simple guidance, delivered in an engaging and refreshing tone of voice, financial wellbeing is improved for the long term. As a testament to this, the London-based fintech reports that 84% of people feel better about their money after just one month of using the app. Meanwhile, average engagement levels with Cleo are more than 250% higher than competitors. Already the startup has been able to help millions of users on their financial journey with over half converting to one of Cleo’s paying subscription tiers within the first 12 months of downloading the app – an impressive feat for a financial app. Moving forward, the new funds will be used to accelerate the growth of the app, with plans to expand further into the US and expand the team from 140 members to over 220. As financial times become more and more pressured, and more and more young people begin to look for solutions to help them navigate these times, the Cleo app is sure to keep growing. It’s the perfect example of how a purpose-driven innovation can both have a lasting, positive impact as well as have success. Hussey-Yeo added: “Later-stage fundraising has become a lot more challenging since the start of the downturn, and we’re gratified by the enthusiasm shown to us by both new and existing investors. Our investors recognise the vital work we’re doing in giving young people a stronger financial foothold. The goal is to build an enduring, trusted relationship with this audience – by speaking their language and giving them financial services support tailored to their unique needs and circumstances. It’s a huge market opportunity and one that, thanks to this raise, we’re well-placed to capitalise upon.” Harold Boël, CEO at Sofina said: “Investing in Cleo illustrates our strategy of building a diversified portfolio of businesses leveraging technology to improve people’s lives. Cleo’s mission of bringing fintech-enabled personal financial empowerment to many people worldwide resonates with our own. We were impressed by the drive and the talent of the team and look forward to our partnership.”"
2022.6.30,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/berlin-based-project-eaden-snaps-up-e8-million-to-create-sustainable-food-at-scale/,"Foodtech startup Project Eaden is using tech to create tasty and sustainable food at scale, including animal-free steaks. The startup has just snapped up €8 million in fresh funding to ramp up operations. The food industry is one that’s all about passion. From those cultivating and growing the produce, to those generating the recipes and cooking it up, all the way to those enjoying the taste – the entire spectrum of the food industry requires enjoyment and appreciation for the products. Aiming to create ‘earthly pleasures’ for foodies, whilst prioritising sustainability without compromise, Project Eaden has just secured €8 million. Founded earlier this year, the Berlin-based startup’s seed round was led by Creandum and was joined by Magnetic, Atlantic Food Labs, Shio Capital, Trellis Road and prominent Angel investors. The food industry, whilst one deeply rooted in the full lifecycle of creation, has been exposed as a main pollutant and emitter of greenhouse gases – with meat products taking a chunk of responsibility. Despite this, meat consumption is growing. With a growing population, loss of land, and, a climate crisis – the current food supply chain and consumption are simply not sustainable. Co-founder, Hubertus Bessau, stated: “We have to solve the very human dilemma of giving in to our cravings despite knowing better. It must become a pleasure to save our planet.” It’s thought that one of the reasons we are not moving to suitable food alternatives is due to a lack of viable and affordable alternative options on the market. Certainly, in the last couple of years, we have seen a massive surge of plant-based products emerge and foodtech is a sector that is turning the heat up in the kitchen. The alternatives are there and the market is getting more and more competitive. Putting their place in the pot, Project Eaden has been described as ‘the Tesla of sustainable food’. The startup is using innovative platform technology to develop a wide range of never-seen-before products that enhance the pleasures of life without compromise. The foodtech innovator’s products’ are highly scalable and can lead to attractive customer prices and broad adoption. The first creation that is getting attention? Animal-free steaks. The startup has an interesting founding team, with experience in all dimensions of building successful food companies. Dr.-Ing. David Schmelzeisen leads Project Eaden’s R&D. He obtained his PhD in engineering from RWTH Aachen University and is a sophisticated hobby chef. Hubertus Bessau brings in his entrepreneurial and brand-building expertise from co-founding and scaling the iconic custom-made cereal brand mymuesli. Jan Wilmking applies his expertise in building companies from small to large, which he gained from 6 years in Zalando’s top management team. Co-founder, Jan Wilmking, added: “As a father of three young kids, I want the next generations to lead a life full of joy as well. Project Eaden brings together world-class scientists, entrepreneurs, and investors to contribute to that.” Making sustainable food products that are scalable, irresistible and affordable is part of the wider impact-driven goal of helping address the global climate and food crisis. This fresh funding will support the young team to further develop its proprietary tech and make the first products ready to market – with plans to hit the shelf in 2023. Carl Fritjofsson, General Partner at Creandum: “David, Hubertus and Jan really make up the complementary dream team you look for as a venture investor, and when I first saw and tasted the steak prototype they had built I was mindblown. We couldn’t be more proud for Creandum to be part of Project Eaden in solving one of humanity’s biggest challenges with mouthwatering food products at scale.”"
2022.6.30,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/uk-fintech-unicorn-zilch-secures-an-additional-e47-9-million-for-its-bnpl-platform/,"London-based fintech double unicorn Zilch has extended its Series C by €47.9 million. Offering a pioneering Buy Now Pay Later platform, the startup has been growing at an incredible pace and leading new approaches to payments across the continent. Payment processes are undergoing a major shift at the moment. One of the biggest innovations shaping the market is of course the BNPL option. Pioneering the space with its next-generation payment platform, Zilch, is one of Europe’s fastest-growing fintechs and has just secured an additional boost of €49.7 million. The double unicorn – or duocorn as we like to say – has now reached more than €153 million in its Series C funding. Zilch today has an impressive list of global investors, which includes Ventura Capital, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Gauss Ventures, DMG Ventures, M&F Fund and Limited Ventures. Founded in 2018, and launched in September 2020 by Philip Belamant and Sean O’Connor, Zilch is undoubtedly one of Europe’s hottest fintech startups. The company went from Series A to unicorn in just 14 months as it redefined the BNPL segment. Its unique platform utilises Open Banking Technology whereby they only lend a user what they can afford to pay back, preventing problematic debt. It’s using technology to improve financial health for users – a refreshing approach for the sector. Operating with a D2C model, the startup is able to build direct relationships with customers – a key part of its success story. CEO Philip joined us at the 2022 edition of the EU-Startups Summit, where he was able to share insights into this remarkable growth story. Philip explained: “In a world of rising interest rates and inflation, it has never been more important for customers to have access to a payment product that they can depend on for savings, deals and cash flow management with no interest or late fees of any kind. Open Banking data shows how customers of all ages are migrating away from traditional high-cost credit cards or overdrafts in favour of services like Zilch – saving them millions. This extension is a great endorsement of our unique model as well as our investors’ belief in our ability to deliver on our mission to create the world’s most empowering way for people to pay for anything, anywhere.” In the last six months, Zilch has leveraged its innovative, direct-to-consumer approach to double underlying sales and revenue. Customers can pay on debit (with up to 2% instant cashback and rewards) or credit (pay-in-4) for no interest or late fees, anywhere. This differentiated model has seen Zilch achieve higher utilisation than any other peer in the space – showing just how important it is to engage with and understand consumers. This fresh funding, which comes off the back of picking up €95 million in November 2021, is also rooted in a context of increased regulation in the BNPL segment. The UK government recently set out a new framework for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to review the sector. Zilch actually worked alongside the FCA as part of the Sandbox Programme – becoming one of the first BNPL providers in the UK to be granted an FCA licence to perform regulated Consumer Credit activities. But that’s not all. This year, Zilch has also partnered with Experian (leading credit reporting agency), to pioneer reciprocal reporting of payment plans to the credit reporting agency’s (CRA’s) data set. This ensures consumers’ financial health by providing greater transparency and accuracy while rewarding customers for their responsible behaviour. Alongside this, Zilch already utilises a blend of Open Banking technology combined with soft credit checks and its own proprietary behavioural data each time a customer spends. This allows Zilch to develop a real-time view of a customer’s financial health, creating a 360-degree picture of a customer’s affordability profile and providing accurate, individualised spending recommendations. Given its regulatory stamp of approval, customer care and popularity, and fundraising success, there are exciting times ahead for the fintech firm – and we’re keeping a close watch. This new capital boost will be used to fuel further growth. Currently, the team is set on taking on the US market where they recently opened a Miami office and launched with over 150k pre-registered customers. Early numbers are showing significant momentum with growth rates of over 4x what was achieved in the UK where Zilch reached 2 million new customers in just 18 months. Sean O’Connor, the Co-Founder, added: “Since we founded Zilch and began raising capital, the markets have been difficult to predict given COVID and now the downturn the markets are currently seeing. We believe our focus on alignment with the consumer, delivered by our innovative business model, has the potential to create significant long-term value for shareholders. Our extensive investment in communicating this message and developing our international network of renowned private, family office and institutional investors has enabled us to secure this extension at the same terms as our Series C, which is a testament to their belief in our significant market opportunity, and our ability to execute against it.”"
2022.6.30,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/telness-tech-founder-martina-gives-us-an-exclusive-look-at-a-fresh-e8-5-million-raise/,"Swedish teltech startup Telness Tech has just secured €8.5 million in Series A funding. We take an exclusive look at this news with insights from the founder, Martina Klingvall. The European telecoms market is taking to the clouds, and Telness Tech is a Swedish startup navigating the journey. Founded in 2021, the company spun out of Swedish telecoms provider Telness (launched in 2016) and is shaking up the telecommunications industry. Today, Telness Tech have announced an €8.5 million capital boost led by Stockholm-based VC, Industrifonden. Telness Tech’s existing investor, JCE Group, also participated in the round. Telecommunications is one of those industries that is fundamental to society, however, it’s one that has also been slow to innovate and digitise. This is what Telness Tech aims to ignite – offering a cloud-based infrastructure that businesses can use to increase customer happiness and lower operational expenditure. Speaking on the vision behind Telness Tech, Founder Martina Klingvall said: “The vision is to raise the standards we’ve come to expect from the telecoms industry. We believe that the industry can deliver great customer experience in a digital environment, just like the consumer-facing services we see in other sectors. That is why we launched our digital operator, Telness, in Sweden before offering our tech platform to anyone else. With Telness we’ve proven that you can create a totally digital experience and be loved by customers at the same time. Now the same platform on which we built Telness is available to all telecoms operators looking to transform their product offering and customer service through Telness Tech. Our tech now stands to be an injection of innovation for the entire industry, whilst also reducing costs and boosting customer happiness and experience.” The platform, already used by Telness to deliver telecoms services to over 15k business customers in Sweden, comprises a cloud-based digital end-to-end solution that liberates traditional telcos from legacy infrastructure, cost and complexity. With its cloud-based PBX, it also enables telcos to keep up with innovation and the pace of challenger brands at a low cost of ownership – so the industry can keep developing and pushing into new frontiers. And consumers aren’t hit with rising rollercoaster prices. Commenting on the need to innovate in the telecoms sector, Martina shared her thoughts: “The telecom industry offers commodity services and still exists with few large players in each market. Since there is a large barrier to enter a market, there is also a lack of innovation coupled with a clear need for shareholders to be “fat and happy”. Digital transformation has changed expectations from customers, based on experiences and standards from other industries, and they’re now demanding more modern services from their telcos. Every industry needs disruptors to help move the needle and drive innovation. Teltech is what fintech was to finance. It’s the disruptive force that is capable of sparking systemic change in the industry. Telness Tech’s platform can enable operators to make a difference and do so quickly, without failing with costly, large “transformation” projects. What most costly and slow transformation projects would achieve in three years, we can do in a matter of months because our platform is cloud-based and can easily integrate into existing systems.” In the face of a growing cost-of-living crisis, teltech is one way that innovation can help consumers lower costs and manage their money. We chatted to Martina about this: “With prices rising, this will prompt customers to switch providers. They won’t just be looking purely at prices but also at value for money. Consumers want a great service at a low cost and it’s those MVNOs and challenger brands that are built on the cloud and partnered up with teltechs like Telness Tech that have the upper hand here when it comes to attracting new customers. In the longer term those telcos that are run from a platform such as ours can reduce prices further and increase efficiency – so it’s a win for them and for the customers.” So, what’s next for the startup? With this fresh new funding, the company certainly has scope to expand and grow into new markets, bringing its money-saving, innovative tech to the European masses. According to Martina, the company wants to focus initially on the UK and the Netherlands before driving change in the telecoms industry on a global scale. She added: “We have a great product that can enable others to make a difference in their market and for its customers. Our goal is to become the next generation ‘Swedish Ericsson’ and provide the telecom industry with innovative and digital core technology worldwide.”"
2022.6.30,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/aarhus-based-vibrant-picks-up-e4-million-to-turn-mobiles-into-a-point-of-sale/,"In a major boost to Europe’s SMEs and small vendors, fintech startup Vibrant has just picked up €4 million for its app that turns Android mobiles into points of sale, making payments simpler and more accessible. The payments sector is heating up and thanks to tech development, the way we pay for goods and services has changed at an incredible pace. While just a few years ago, most of us had cash with us, as well as our bank cards, now, many people use just their phone or even their watch. Tech innovations are making payment processes easier for consumers, but, some SMEs and small vendors are getting left behind. This is what Vibrant want to help solve. The Danish startup has developed an app that converts Android mobile phones into points of sale. The team has just picked up €4 million in seed funding led by byFounders, with Luminar Ventures participating. Founded in 2020 in Aarhus by Kasper Krog (CEO), Kåre Sørersen (CPO), Anders Kaels Malmos (CTO), the fintech innovators’ goal is to make monetary merchant-customer transactions easier and more accessible than ever before. According to the company, about half of SMEs in Europe don’t yet engage in card payments whatsoever – despite it being the expected way to pay among customers. Vibrant CEO Kasper Krog explained: “Digital payments now dwarf cash as the default type of transaction. This immense growth of contactless payments was accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected many small businesses terribly. As these companies find their feet again, we want to empower them with the digital tools they need. We believe in liberating merchants from the legacy of cash and expensive card machines. Mobile devices can act as pocket terminals for any small trader, which is the next chapter in the future of the cashless society.” Vibrant provides digital tools that enable businesses to pivot away from card terminals, coins, and notes, ensuring that small business vendors are equipped to inexpensively and simply enact sales. Whilst card terminals can take several months to be delivered, Vibrant can be downloaded instantly for use with Android devices. The startup has already built a multi-national team of 25 to scale its product – and it’s growing fast. With transactions currently increasing a reported 70% month-on-month, this new investment will be used to further grow the customer base as well as enter into new markets. Eric Lagier, Founder and Managing Partner at byFounders, said: “We are delighted to contribute further to the impressive growth of Vibrant. The process of customer-business transactions is becoming more and more streamlined and Vibrant’s easy-to-use, tap-to-phone app and simple pricing ensure that businesses can concentrate on providing top-quality goods and services. They are empowering the next generation of merchants.” Daniel Karsberg, Partner at Luminar Ventures added: “We couldn’t be more passionate about Vibrant’s journey and potential, as a company poised to disrupt the market’s established incumbents. The fact that not one Vibrant user has returned to using card terminals speaks for itself.”"
2022.6.30,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/06/swedish-startup-goatlane-picks-up-e500k-to-redesign-golf-sneakers/,"Using tech to optimise sports performance and look good whilst doing it, Swedish startup Goatlane has picked up €500k of fresh funding. Aiming to seamlessly blend fashion and sports performance, Stockholm-based Goatlane is pioneering a new footwear range developed in partnership with pro-golfers. The startup has just got a hole-in-one in the form of a fresh capital boost of €500k seed funding. Investing in the round are Swedish angel investors Henrik Grundén and Juri Gendelman, co-founders of global activewear brand Stronger. Grundén’s and Gendelman’s ecommerce expertise will be pivotal to Goatlane’s progress, in their roles as strategic advisors to the brand. Founded in 2020 by Gustav Schauman, the startup combines the now-CEO’s passion for sport with a decade of experience in investment. Developed in partnership with PGA Tour and LPGA Tour professional golfers Henrik Norlander and Alana Uriell, Goatlane’s footwear is unique in blending street fashion aesthetics with all the technical requirements of a professional-standard spikeless golf shoe. Gustav Schauman, CEO and Founder of Goatlane, commented: “It feels fantastic to receive the backing of Henrik and Juri. They are some of Europe’s leading D2C entrepreneurs and have an outstanding track record of building and growing a global brand within the activewear space. I know that their experience and know-how will be invaluable in helping bring Goatlane to the next level.” Handmade in Portugal, it’s a truly Europan endeavour, using tech know-how to make a cutting-edge product. The shoe bodies are made with recycled materials and are waterproof. Further, all of the packaging is made from 100% recyclable materials. Its bringing sustainability into sports fashion. This fresh funding will be used to boost market expansion in the USA, product development and expansion of the sneaker range. The brand wants to extend into new categories later this year. Henrik Grundén added: “Juri and I have followed Gustav and the team’s work to develop Goatlane closely in recent years. We have been impressed by the quality of the products and we agree with Goatlane that the golf market needs a new pioneer in the category. Goatlane has created a unique bridge between comfortable, everyday fashion and traditional golfwear. This novel approach has attracted a new target group, which has proven to be very satisfied with the products and very dedicated to the brand. With our experience, we look forward to developing Goatlane’s online presence to elevate growth and take the next steps in expanding its international presence.”"
2022.7.1,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/stockholm-based-edtech-startup-growloop-raises-e1-million-for-its-digital-coach-of-the-future/,"Based in Stockholm and developed by V3VO, Growloop has just secured a fully subscribed €1 million seed round. The digital leadership coaching tool is democratizing access to leadership development and shaping new approaches to workplace training. The ways in which we work and the ways in which businesses operate have been undergoing transformative change recently. With the rise of remote working, talent shortages, rising demands from employees, and awareness of toxic burnout culture, one element shaping more balanced approaches to work is the rise of coaching and development. Founded in 2021, Growloop has just secured €1 million for its digital leadership coach of the future that’s aiming to democratize access to skills development. The Stockholm-based company developed from edtech company V3VO with the vision to help every human have a balanced and fulfilled work life. It’s an impact-driven endeavour based on the belief that in order to change the world for the better, we all need to unleash the power of the leader within. It’s now been made clear that running a business exclusively from the top is not the most effective way forward – and it’s not even the easiest. In the context of growing uncertainty, ambiguity and complexity around the world, it’s apparent that everyone needs to be part of the leadership function to create meaningful results. However, leadership programmes and skills development programmes for companies are still expensive and demanding. Generally, they are not personalized for each individual or context, and so, it’s remained a ‘nice-to-have’ rather than a ‘must-have’. A reported 83% of European companies want leadership development on all levels in their organisations, yet only 5% have implemented it. Comprising a digital leadership coach and trainer, the Growloop allows teams of all sorts to develop skills – meaning staff at all levels (from juniors to managers) can grow together and learn together. It’s also affordable and cost-effective, so accessible to teams of all sizes and revenues. It means they can reach meaningful results and outcomes faster, on a bigger scale and at a smaller cost. Growloop developed out of V3VO, a digital learning platform launched in 2019. It’s on a mission to reach 1 billion people who want to boost their leadership skills and unlock their potential. It’s backed by 9 shareholders – the majority owners are the founders and global leadership consultants Mattias Seger and Monica Edgren. Johan Landgren is the CEO and also co-founder. Sting, Hans Isoz, Karl Wassgren, Rebecka Eriksson, and the coach Jenny Rosenkrantz, Ideabits plus an international investor are also included among the shareholders. Launching Growloop is a major milestone in achieving a world where more people have the leadership skills they need to navigate complexity. Already the app is being used to support leadership development in fast-paced organizations as part of strategy to expand faster, including the likes of Forex, Peltarion and Drama Queen. This new funding will help the edtech tool scale and bring its vision of democratized professional development to more people and organisations across the continent. Johan Landgren, CEO and co-founder, commented: “Given the challenges and opportunities we have as individuals, organizations and the world, we need the keys to how we can thrive and grow sustainably and even regenerative. To create and reach more meaningful results together. With the new resources, we can now further equip Growloop with more growth power, new learning experiences and AI features. At the same time, we can invest in supporting growth journeys in many more European organizations. A big win for everyone.”"
2022.7.1,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/copenhagen-based-startup-reel-catches-e2-3-million-to-power-a-renewable-europe/,"Reeling in one of Denmark’s largest pre-seed investments ever, climate tech startup Reel has picked up €2.3 million. The Copenhagen-based team is on a mission to transform electricity procurement, encouraging the renewable energy transition. Europe is on an ambitious journey – with the end destination of Net Zero. Based on the guidelines and promises set out, there is still a long way to go before we get there, and time is running out. Reaching Net Zero is also not simply an aspiration, an ‘it would be nice’, but rather, it’s essential for our society and planet. In the race to get there, startups and tech innovators are paving the way and giving vital solutions to companies and governments alike. Copenhagen-based startup Reel is one such startup. The climate tech team are setting out to fight climate change by transforming electricity procurement, offering a way for companies to buy electricity on commercially attractive terms. In addition, Reel ties companies’ electricity procurement directly to the construction of new solar and wind parks – so the renewable energy transition is further supported. The startup just raised €2.3 million in pre-seed funding. The round was led by UVC Partners, a venture capital fund focused on European early-stage B2B startups, with participation from The Footprint Firm, a sustainability-devoted investment company, North-East Family Office, a global private multi-family office, and a group of energy specialists and experienced founders such as the chairman of InCommodities, Bo Wase, the co-founder of Netlify, Christian Bach, and the co-founder of inspired, Jürgen Mayerhofer. The need for companies to reduce their environmental footprint has never been higher. And the urgency to move towards renewable, sustainable sources has been made all the more apparent in the current context of record-high and volatile prices. CEO and Co-Founder, Jon Sigvert explained how this is one of the driving forces behind the need to move to sustainable energy: “Electricity is one of the main sources of CO₂ emissions globally. Total electricity demand is expected to double within this decade² and consequently, renewable energy generation needs to increase drastically. Governmental subsidies are phased out³, and the renewable energy transition is now driven by consumer demand. At the same time, the current energy crisis has emphasised the urgency for companies to ensure financial certainty through their electricity procurement. Reel empowers companies to drive the transition in an easy and financially attractive way.” Founded in 2020, Reel has developed a solution based on an emerging type of renewable energy contract, called Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). PPAs are signed between renewable energy developers and companies buying electricity for a long-term period at a fixed price. Renewable energy developers use PPAs to secure financing for the construction of new solar and wind parks, and companies are credited for the addition of new renewable energy while securing attractive electricity pricing. Until recently, PPAs were exclusively available for the 1% largest companies due to a number of constraints related to the size of electricity consumption, credit rating and legal expertise. But Reel is making PPAs available to all companies in a monumental step forward that will enable more companies to support the energy transition. The startup issimplifying legal complexity and optimising the parameters needed to sign PPAs. The solution is based on large amounts of data on factors such as electricity consumption and credit rating. On top of that, Reel provides automated CO₂ reporting out of the box. According to Christian Randløv Schmidt, CTO and co-founder of Reel, using technology to transform electricity procurement has great potential: “We are operating in a sector that is extremely conservative and old-fashioned. The optimisation potential is huge and by realising this potential, we can create immense value for both our customers and the climate. What we are trying to achieve is akin to how the technology-driven challenger banks have transformed the conservative financial sector in the past decade – but instead of only optimising for profit, we also optimise for climate impact.” Commercial and industrial sectors are reported to account for two-thirds of total global electricity consumption. So, there is clearly an urgent need for an off-the-shelf electricity procurement solution, available to all companies – and it’s evident that this will have an immense impact on reducing emissions and powering a society built on a new form of energy. Reel has developed a system that is rooted in climate science – breaking with the prevailing status quo and offering a viable approach. Anders Kjemtrup, CCO and co-founder, explained: “Conventional ‘green’ electricity contracts are based on certificates that allow you to claim that you use carbon-free electricity. However, these certificates do not actually lead to new CO₂ reductions. This is hugely problematic as CO₂ reduction efforts are overestimated and we risk falling short of the Paris Agreement. In addition, it is commercially unattractive as companies pay extra for the certificates. Our PPA solution solves for all of these issues, and allows all companies – big and small – to help accelerate the renewable energy transition.” This fresh funding boost will be used by the climate innovators to scale up operations and launch the software in Denmark. Launching as a certified electricity provider in Denmark in the fall of 2022, the company sets out to be the go-to green electricity provider by offering a full-service solution with the delivery of electricity, reporting on CO₂ accounting, and advice on climate communication. Jon Sigvert added: “Companies are increasingly aware of their carbon footprint and are implementing measures to take responsibility for their impact on the climate. This is a promising development, but to effectively solve the climate crisis in time, these intentions need to be converted into actual CO₂ reductions. And that is what we help companies to ensure.”"

2022.7.1,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/combining-impact-with-financial-gain-insights-from-investors-in-the-foodtech-space/,"Rolling into summer, it’s been an energizing and busy few months in the European startup community. With the return of in-person events, there have been plenty of opportunities to get connecting and chatting with different entrepreneurs, investors and thought leaders from across the ecosystem. From the EU-Startups Summit which we hosted in Barcelona in May, quickly followed by the Tech.EU event held in Brussels, to F&A Next 2022 and VivaTech in Paris (where the Ukrainian president made a surprise hologram appearance), all of these events have had one conversation piece in common: market conditions and business impact, either societal or environmental. Prioritising impact in the midst of uncertainty Looking at the current market downturn with high inflation, rising interest rates and the global food supply at risk, we wanted to find out first-hand if the need for sustainability, climate or cleantech investments has shifted. So, we sat down with a couple of investors and founders to learn how they are navigating the current markets and what advice they would give to impact-driven founders looking to raise capital. Impact needs to go hand-in-hand with financial return Co-founding partner Clare Murray from Blume Equity, partnering with tech-enabled businesses across sustainable food, healthy living and responsible consumption at the growth equity stage in Europe, believes “Europe has a very robust impact funding ecosystem at the venture stage. What is missing is a pool of capital at the next stage to support these companies on their scale up journies. In order for impact investing to become mainstream, impact needs to go hand in hand with financial returns.” Blume Equity’s biggest challenge in today’s shifting markets is growing the team with a focus on building its own company culture and creating its own ecosystem. Clare’s advice to founders looking to raise capital now: “Just keep at it, take feedback but stand your ground, use your network to get media placements or introductions. If you are close to profitability is a good time to rise. Sequoia’s advice is a great piece to review to proactively prepare questions investors might have. Be aware of your valuation and if possible raise smaller rounds.” Blume Equity has invested in Elvie, the women’s health tech pioneer behind a connected breast pump and smart pelvic floor exerciser based in the UK and the online discount food store Motatos, or Matsmart as it is locally known in Sweden. The Blume team currently has its eye on food waste solutions and carbon accounting. Choose investors wisely We also spoke with Marie Asano, Partner at the European Circular Bioeconomy Fund. The fund describes itself as the first European VC in (circular) bioeconomy exclusively dedicated to scaling growth-stage companies in food and energy contributing to a climate-neutral Europe. Marie joined ECBF in 2021, as she wanted a role where she could use her knowledge in science, to always learn something new, combined with bringing the next innovative technology to market.  In her words, joining the team allowed her to make a “small contribution to the world and our future by investing in not the next generation of companies with a cool innovation, but those that have products which will allow us to be more sustainable.” Marie’s first investment was a 3D printing company that produced implants out of high-performance polymers. Marie and the team have their eyes on precision fermentation, not only for producing biomass but as a whole new method of production to produce functional ingredients. At the F&A Next, as part of the jury for the startup challenge, she was impressed by Plantik. Marie’s advice to founders looking to raise capital now: “Raise more than you have anticipated to make sure you have some financial buffer. Also, choose investors that will help you strategically and financially weather the storm.” Quickly prove your innovation’s value Alongside investors, we also chatted to Clemens Rengier, Founder and CEO of Biorena, the Munich-based startup offering same-day delivery of high-quality organic products The idea came about after realizing that there was no local player delivering organic food in a sustainable and convenient manner. Biorena delivers from its 1500sqm warehouse only 15min from the centre of Munich using electric cars. Similar European players are Crips in the Netherlands, Farmy in Switzerland or Kazidom in France already active in the Benelux region. The biggest challenge the team faces right now is to expand through Germany, city by city, and then envision an expansion into Austria and Switzerland as the next step. Clemens’s advice to founders looking to raise capital now: “Focus on profitability as much as possible, and show to potential investors what is coming soon. I believe great models will survive. Less burn, more profitability is key no matter the market conditions.” Be strategic Other founders, such as Brad Vanstone, Co-Founder and CEO, Willicroft, a plant-based cheese startup based in Amsterdam, also present at the event, are of the opinion that founders should: “Understand early on where your strengths and weaknesses lie. Food is so multifaceted and complex that it’s important to excel in 2-3 areas and find partners who can take care of the rest. Strategic investment is paramount to this as money can only get you so far. We’ve also found that focus is key. There are so many opportunities out there – honing in on a couple of goals rather than spreading yourselves too thin is a much stronger recipe for success.” Brad also believes that “businesses that make impact part of their foundation from the beginning will be the ones that survive over the years ahead. Climate change is not going anywhere so whilst the obvious thing to do right now might be to cut corners that’s very shortsighted in my eyes!” There is no one size fits all advice scenario, but it’s clear there are still plenty of reasons to be optimistic, and plenty of proactive steps startup founders can take. Take these learnings and insights and apply the most relevant to your business. Most important? Make sure you and your teams are staying informed and that you are able to adapt rapidly. Stay dynamic."

2022.7.4,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/london-based-fintech-startup-raylo-raises-e7-5-million-for-its-subscription-payment-solution/,"Bringing the increasingly popular subscription model to retailers, London-based startup Raylo has just raised €7.5 million. The fintech firm is reimaging payment options in a way that enables people to get access to the tech they need in a sustainable way. With the cost of living rising across Europe, consumers are finding it more difficult to make purchases upfront and in one go. Across Europe, the crisis has fueled increased interest in alternative payment methods, and the Buy Now Pay Later and subscription models are standing out as the most popular options. As a result, innovation in fintech is accelerating with new solutions coming to the market. Aiming to lead the change in how products are sold and enjoyed, fintech startup Raylo has developed a platform that enables companies to embed a subscription model into payment processes. It means that consumers can access the tech they want, in a financially and environmentally responsible and sustainable way. Founded in 2019, the startup has just picked up €7.5 million in additional funding, including a strategic investment from Wayra UK, part of the global telecoms group, Telefónica. Existing investors Octopus Ventures and Macquarie also participated in the round. Bruno Moraes, Managing Director of Wayra UK, commented: “There is a clear shift in consumer behaviour and their preference for subscription-based payment models. There’s an appetite for more affordable options to purchase great technology and devices. The Raylo team has proven success in delivering on this consumer trend, and we look forward to helping them scale up their platform through our strategic resources and networks.” The surge in demand for more flexible ways to pay, brought on by the rapidly increasing cost of living, has fuelled a change in consumers’ expectations. The ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ (BNPL) space is well known for its ‘Pay in 3’ model and is particularly popular for small and mid-sized purchases with fast fashion and beauty retailers. However, for larger ticket items such as consumer electronics, there lacks a solution to fully address consumer affordability and poor checkout conversion rates. This is where London-based Raylo finds its target market. By adopting Raylo Pay, retailers can add a new subscription revenue stream that increases customer conversion, while offering a more affordable and sustainable option at checkout. The platform enables consumers to have access to the latest products via a monthly subscription that’s both more economical and sustainable. Retailers are paid upfront and in full (zero fees) for any purchases, whilst consumers pay only a fraction of the cost of the product during the subscription term. When consumers are ready to upgrade, the old products are returned and enter Raylo’s circular process of refurb and re-commerce for maximum lifespan and sustainability. It, therefore, makes for more financial stability and flexibility for consumers, as well as making the purchase of electronic goods circular – a real win-win. Raylo’s retailer pipeline extends across a number of categories, including consumer electronics. Affordable Mobiles, a leading UK electronics retailer, is amongst the first to add Raylo Pay to their checkout, offering their customers 12, 24 and 36-month subscriptions across tablets, laptops and smartphones. Raylo co-founder and CEO, Karl Gilbert, added: “We are delighted that Telefónica shares our vision of bringing our Raylo Pay solution to retailers across the UK and beyond. Subscriptions are a fundamentally better way to sell any durable product with a regular upgrade cycle – retailers enjoy a significant conversion uplift, consumers pay a fraction of the cost each month, and we avoid the wastefulness that has been encouraged under other payment models.”"
2022.7.4,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/munich-based-seatti-scores-e3-million-to-optimize-approaches-to-hybrid-work/,"SaaS startup Seatti has picked up €3 million for its pioneering platform that is helping companies unlock the potential of hybrid working, boosting productivity and flexibility for employees and businesses alike. Remote and hybrid working models have swiftly become the new standard of work. Various studies have shown that the hybrid model offers the best of both worlds and is boosting productivity for companies and happiness levels for employees. However, whilst hybrid working has taken the world by storm and most companies now adopt it to some degree, it’s still very much in its infancy. The model still has some challenges to work through and there’s still some experimentation on how best to navigate this approach to working. Munich-based Seatti has developed a solution that aims to make hybrid working simpler, more flexible and optimised. The startup has just picked up €3 million in a Seed round led by Acton Capital and Partech. Seattle’s pre-seed investors Peak and HPI Seed Fund also participated in the round. Founded in 2021, Seatti’s mission is to maximize the benefits and minimize the complexity of hybrid work for both companies and their employees. The SaaS solution enables employees to book shared desks, meeting rooms and parking lots in corporate offices while also planning and sharing their hybrid work locations. By doing so, users are sure to find the ideal workspace based on their tasks for the day and the whereabouts of their favourite colleagues. At the same time, the solution enables companies to analyse and integrate the booking data in a fully GDPR-compliant manner to improve their office spaces, hybrid work policies and regulatory compliance. Seatti focuses on deep integration with the Microsoft ecosystem throughout its software, including MS-Teams, Azure Active Directory, Outlook and Exchange. Christopher Bieri, Co-Founder of Seatti, explained: “The vast majority of enterprises have implemented a hybrid working model at an unprecedented speed enforced by the pandemic. Such a significant change to the way we work would have taken years, if not decades, in a covid-free world. Due to this abrupt paradigm shift, companies must now quickly address newly arising challenges brought about by hybrid work. Our research shows that 160 billion euros are wasted on underused office space annually, in-person meetups between colleagues have dropped by over 30% and 68% of organizations are not yet fully compliant with regulatory and internal policy requirements.” As highlighted by the Seatti team, most employees prefer a hybrid working arrangement and it’s reported that 9/10 of companies will be pursuing hybrid work for the long term. But, it doesn’t come without inherent challenges. As a result, the market to provide effective solutions is worth an estimated €30 billion – which Seatti is primed and ready to enter. The young startup is aiming to solve challenges by facilitating more personal meetups between colleagues while ensuring more efficient use of office space as well as full compliance with regulatory requirements. It’s a system that addresses the three core challenges. Since launching in May 2021, the startup has already welcomed some of Germany’s largest corporations to its client base, including Osram, Sixt, Sartorius, Mazars and FlixBus. Further, reporting 30% monthly growth in 2022, Seatti has become one of Europe’s fastest-growing SaaS platforms for hybrid workforces and shared workspace management. Sebastian Wossagk, managing partner at Acton Capital, said: “Hybrid work is here to stay. What began as a sudden shift two years ago, will be a key differentiator for employers in the fight for talent across industries. Especially large organizations are now in an urgent need for an agile solution to manage their fast-growing hybrid workforce. Thanks to its easy integration, intuitive use and fully compliance to all regulatory requirements, Seatti’s SaaS platform has convinced enterprise clients and employees alike.” Going forward, the remote-first team plans to use the new funding to more than triple in size, expand the core functionalities of its hybrid work management tool and address the high demand from enterprise clients. As a result, Seatti expects to triple its revenues in both, 2022 and 2023. Romain Lavault, General Partner of Partech, added: “We have been instantly convinced by the passion and energy of Chris, Johannes and Moritz and we are determined to support them in making Seatti a company that will permanently change the way employees of all generations can deliver more value together. Adoption by some of the most well-known companies only a few months after launching and the rave reviews of their users shows that this is already well underway!”."

2022.7.4,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/challenging-the-status-quo-of-healthcare-jonas-muff-tells-us-about-the-vision-behind-vara/,"Founded in Germany in 2018, Vara is fuelled by the conviction that every woman around the world should have access to breast cancer screening. The AI-powered platform, created in tandem with radiologists, combines the strengths of humans and tech to make breast cancer screening more effective, more measurable and more accessible. Implementing Vara’s technology increases the productivity of the screening physician while lowering the risk of missing cancer. The reality is that every year there are 700k deaths from breast cancer – and 70% of all of these happen in low and middle-income countries. The reason for this is rooted in the ability to detect breast cancer early on, due to a lack of access to technology and specialised doctors. It’s an issue with intersectional implications and one that we should no longer accept. It’s reported that catching breast cancer early, through sufficient screening programmes, can significantly increase the chances of survival, from 27% to 98%. But, while only a handful of countries offer such screening programmes, there’s a huge gap in how women experience breast cancer and their chances of survival. This is what fuels Vara – a desire to drive impact and make a change, making breast cancer screening more widely available and improving the chances of survival for women worldwide. We had the chance to talk to the inspiring founder and CEO behind the company, Jonas Muff. Discussing the startup’s mission to make an impact on the lives of women around the world, as well as the company’s unique tech approach and global expansion plans makes for an insightful and emotive interview. Vara’s mission of making breast cancer screening more accessible is a very laudable goal. What initially prompted you to create a company to try to solve this problem? Vara began as a project at venture studio Merantix in Berlin, in which people from different backgrounds, all with entrepreneurial mindsets, were brought together to tackle real-world problems in innovative ways. We assembled a team of machine learning experts, software developers, product designers, entrepreneurs and radiologists, and set out to reimagine the breast cancer screening workflow from the bottom up. We knew that for the technology to make a difference in the real world – to the workflows of radiologists, and the experience of women being screened – it needed to be embedded throughout the process. With this in mind, we partnered with some of Germany’s leading screening radiologists to build a platform that standardises the entire clinical workflow and enhances it through the use of advanced AI, automation and data management tools. What are the barriers that currently prevent effective screening programmes from being established? What can be done to overcome these? We see that the issues preventing countries from offering routine breast cancer screening programs are complex and multifaceted, and can’t be overcome by just donating scanners, or running software. Through our work, we realised that although breast cancer screening is standard in most European countries, including our home country of Germany, most countries in the world do not offer at-risk women screening. This showed us that not only did Vara have purpose, but that there was a desperate and growing need for a platform like ours on a global scale. Vara takes an AI based approach to improve the breast cancer screening process. Can you share more about how your product works in practice? We developed the Decision Referral Pathway, a screening process in which the algorithm only makes a statement for cases when it is confidently making accurate predictions — while leaving other cases to human expertise. The goal of the Decision Referral Pathway is to support the radiologist with AI to improve both the sensitivity as well as the specificity i.e. to reduce false negatives and false positives. At the same time, AI is not perfect and cannot make 100% correct predictions for all cases. Therefore, the goal of decision referral is to combine the human expertise of radiologists with the technical capabilities of AI today in a bid to improve both. The three types of classification are then:  Normal triaging: The algorithm selects a subset of cases that it deems normal with high confidence and automatically labels those cases for the radiologist. The goal of normal triaging is to label as many normal cases negative as possible, with minimal misclassification. Safety net: For cases where the AI is very confident that the images are suspicious for cancer, it offers a safety net to prevent missed cancers. Should the radiologist classify one of those cases as negative, the safety net triggers and points the radiologist to a specific region in the image that is suspicious to the AI. The radiologist can then reconsider the decision, potentially catching a cancer that would have otherwise been missed. Unclassified cases: Importantly, the AI does not make a statement for all cases. There are cases that are neither classified as normal (the least suspicious cases), nor is the safety net activated (the most suspicious cases). For those cases, the AI is not confident enough and the decision expertise should come from the radiologist.  We’re still in the early days of healthtech as an industry. What do you believe is the potential for AI, more generally, in healthcare? Firstly, AI on its own is not enough: Vara is not just an algorithm, it’s a full-stack platform. It incorporates AI and automation into every step of the breast cancer screening workflow. It consolidates the previously fragmented processes in one place and does so in a way focused on improving efficiency, enabling remote collaboration and democratising access to better screening programmes. Secondly, Vara AI takes a complementary, rather than competing approach to radiologists. Other AI solutions have centred on one-size-fits-all models to replace radiologists. Such approaches may bias the reader and contribute to decreases in reader sensitivity. Instead, our Decision Referral Pathway supports radiologists. It pre-screens normal mammograms, pre-fills structured reports, and post-screens mammograms for potentially missed cancers, all with very high confidence. We finetune the way the AI and individual radiologists interact to optimise for joint performance, while enabling screening radiologists to focus their attention on potentially suspicious exams. Over time, AI will likely have the ability to take over parts of the clinical workflow from human experts, but for now it doesn’t. The work of a screening radiologist is tough and nuanced! Thirdly, the Vara platform captures real-world data in clinical use. Vara was developed with screening radiologists in one of the world’s most established population-based national breast cancer screening programmes in Germany. It has been trained and evaluated on more than 7 million images to date – one of the largest datasets of its kind globally – and our AI is continuously monitored to provide screening radiologists with key performance metrics. For each woman diagnosed via Vara, we follow the patient pathway after screening to assess AI’s impact on population health metrics such as recall rates and biopsy scores. You recently announced a partnership with Mitera, a hospital in Greece. How is Vara working with the team there? The MITERA and Vara partnership is the first step in our shared mission to increase access to breast screening for women across Greece. Its next vision is to put this comprehensive care closer to women across the country; to enable decentralized screening centers in towns, villages, and surrounding islands. Women in these rural regions are currently disadvantaged due to a lack of access to quality-assured breast screening services. It is envisaged that these screening centers will feed into highly specialized diagnostic clinics where further diagnostic work-up and appropriate management will be ensured.  As a regulated industry, healthtech companies face a lot of challenges when entering new markets. How has this affected your decisions about which markets to expand into? Vara enters fast-growing, emerging markets where systems aren’t yet in place to provide women with the access to breast screening that every woman deserves. Through its partnerships, Vara and providers are able to offer screening at an affordable price, which unlocks screening for women who couldn’t access it before. It does this by supporting the commercial partner’s demand generation with a one-off market development investment per new center. Our business model is built to empower healthcare providers to increase the use of currently underutilised scanners and take a share for each woman screened on the Vara platform. Since Vara takes a share for each woman screened, Vara and the partner share the profits from the increased utilisation. Vara then develops its brand in new markets via the strength of our medical brand and our support to generate demand locally. Market conditions are quite challenging at the moment. How is this impacting Vara and what is your main focus as a business over the next 12 months? The Vara Decision Referral Pathway is now in use in 30% of all screening units in Germany and, as part of our global mission, we recently launched screening units in Mexico and Greece, in partnership with healthcare providers on the ground in those regions. We will continue to show considerable traction in those markets by building out the number of screening centres, and we also aim to open additional screening centres in at least one more country. Here, we are looking for the right partner in a country with an under-developed breast cancer screening service where we can have the largest impact. It sounds like there is a lot happening at Vara! What are you most excited about? Vara’s AI performance is showing immense promise in terms of reproducibility and generalisation. One recently peer-reviewed paper, published in the European Journal of Radiology, found that Vara’s AI can correctly detect interval breast cancers in prior screening mammograms, including in some cases with no discernible suspicious signs. This is the first study to assess the potential of AI to reduce interval cancers based on a realistic screening setting with strict requirements for acceptable recall and false positive rates, and was based on the largest cohort of interval cancer cases assessed by an algorithm. Another large retrospective study is currently in press at the Lancet Digital Health. We just started Germany’s first-ever prospective study to understand Vara’s real-world impact in the clinical screening routine. Noteworthy are our collaborations with renowned academic institutions in the US and Europe, such as Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of Cambridge, Karolinska Institute and the Cancer Registry of Norway. These institutions are evaluating Vara’s performance on breast cancer screening on datasets never seen by Vara and completely independent of the company. We will continue to challenge the status quo of healthcare globally. In the next four years, we aim to launch 1,000 screening centres in countries that currently do not offer screening. Together with partners, this involves scaling our platform further across Latin America while seeking new partnerships with healthcare providers in other geographies. We have, and will continue to deepen our AI’s capabilities by developing it to not only read the current mammography exam, but to also review prior examinations for even more performance gains. This will help us in our long-term vision to catch every deadly breast cancer early."
2022.7.4,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/the-village-network-secures-e3-4-million-to-redefine-early-education-through-its-childcare-marketplace/,"On a mission to create a connected community of quality childcare that supports parents around the world, Warsaw-based The Village has secured €3.4 million in Seed funding. The startup is using tech to create an all-in-one marketplace that supports parents and encourages crucial child development Research has proven that access to early-stage education is pivotal for a child’s development. From the third trimester of pregnancy to around the age of 5 is when about 95% of the brain is formed, making it a crucial moment of development and learning. However, on a global level, many children are missing out on pre-primary education. Missing this crucial moment of brain development can impact the rest of their lives. Based in Warsaw, The Village was founded to address this, providing a tech-led platform that empowers the creation of parent-led micro-schools. The startup just raised €3.4 million in seed funding which saw participation from Movens Capital, 500 Startups, Tilia Impact Ventures and Credo Ventures. The female-founded team are revolutionising approaches to early education with its marketplace which offers a SaaS platform, edtech products, an application for running nurseries, preschools and schools, and The Village marketplace. “All these tools will better support parents to have the access to high-quality education in their neighbourhoods.” Childhood experiences are vital to brain development, and children need to be encouraged to explore, form relationships and be given time to form curiosity about the world around them. Pre-primary education can help encourage this, however, currently, it’s reported that 78% of children globally are missing out. It’s a phenomenon that deepens systemic inequalities and also is an inherently gendered issue – childcare tends to fall on the shoulders of women. With a notable shortage of affordable childcare options, women are disproportionately impacted and often left with the impossible task of deciding between prioritising their career or childcare. This is why The Village has been launched with the mission to tackle this – aiming to improve childhood experiences for enhanced development, to support parents, and, support early educators. Founder Aleksandra Kozera has a background in education, having studied at Harvard, and is a parent herself. “From the beginning, the vision and goal has been to create a village all over the world with committed moms, parents, nannies and teachers – enabling children to have an equal start. And education in so-called “villages” makes it possible. We are already achieving the snowflake effect, when some parents learn about the villages from others, enrol their children in them and open their places. We want to enable multi-dimensional support to open and run villages. That is why we build edtech products and create a marketplace.” The Village creates quality centres for childcare that are empathy and creativity-centric. The nanny-shares, micro-nurseries and preschools are parent-led in so-called ‘villages’ – based in community hubs. Parents and teachers working in the villages participate in the original The Village Way courses and regularly improve their qualifications according to the philosophy of nonviolent communication and Reggio Emilia pedagogy. Aside from forming quality childcare and education, the startup is focused on supporting women’s professional development and fostering gender equity in parenthood and entrepreneurship. The development path for Village owners is structured and holistic so that entrepreneurial mothers gain knowledge and tools in all areas needed to run a business. Essentially, the startup has developed a marketplace for parents where they can find proper childcare in their neighbourhood, and at the same time be supported in their own professional development, as well as providing childcare job opportunities. It’s an end-to-end solution supporting parents in solving the difficulty of finding high-quality child care through technology, content and community. Speaking about the importance of the project, the team commented: “Childcare means more jobs and more women working. Rich experiences in early education are the foundation of democracy and equal opportunities in society. The private sector sees the problem and wants to solve it. If parents want to go to work and have no one to leave their children with, this is an area that needs to be addressed.” Edtech is a growing sector at the moment, but what The Village is setting out to achieve is certainly unique. It is driving impact in three key areas – childcare, gender equity, and job creation – and we are excited to see what’s to come."
2022.7.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/stockholm-based-freshsound-scores-e1-3-million-for-its-original-music-licensing-platform/,"Giving the growing community of content creators and storytellers access to the best possible music, Stockholm-based startup Freshsound has hit the music tech space with €1.3 million. Its licensing platform original music is filling a growing gap in the content marketing and streaming space. Content creation and online storytelling are two massive growth sectors – from the rise of freelancers dedicated to content curtain to brands using streaming and content for marketing, it’s an area that’s exploding. One thing all players in the space need? Access to premium and original music. Welcome, Freshsound. Founded in 2021 by Stephen Gyasi and Sara Larsson, Freshshound’s licensing platform ensures that content creators and storytellers are enabled with the best possible music for their visual content in a friction-free way. The startup has just raised €1.3 million from renowned angels and family offices. The investors include Aligned Ventures, Kristina Tunkrans (former Partner är Cederquist, CEO of PRMD publishing/AtNight and Chief of Music, Epidemic Sound), Shiv Prakash (former VP of Investment, Hipgnosis Song Fund), Marcus Konstantino (Partner, HDR Partners), Gustav Nordlindh (Founder and CEO at Royal Streaming), Kim Fai Kok and Dara Gill (Framtid). With this fresh funding, the Swedish team also announces that Helen McLaughlin, former Managing Director of Warner Music Sweden, Head of A&R at Sony Music Sweden, Head of A&R and Business Development at The Kennel and CEO at V2 Music Scandinavia will join the fold to lead expansion and growth. Helen McLaughlin commented: “I have spent more than three decades working in the music industry and seen its pivotal shift from the physical to the digital era. During the last years, artists, labels, composers and publishers have lost huge amounts of business within the sync space to companies offering musical works not registered with public rights organisations – this is mainly due to the time-consuming clearance process. I am very humble about the complexity of clearing music, but the need for a tool to make the process quicker and more seamless, while still allowing creators and rights holders to set their own terms and requirements in what context their music should be available for customers is paramount. I am really excited to join the Freshsound team as the platform offers all of this – even allowing it on a track by track basis – whilst keeping the pricing individual and matching available works with whatever the sync customer is looking for.“ While content creation is exploding, more and more original music is needed – and it’s needed at a fast pace. Marketing teams and online storytellers are putting out content on a high frequency, and need plenty of music options to keep up the rhythm. However, licensing original songs for commercial use (branded content, games, films, and TV series) can take months to complete. This is driven by a cumbersome process involving multiple parties, complex negotiations, and time-consuming administrative work with labels, songwriters or any rights-holder. For brands and creators, this means giving up on the perfect music for their content in favour of a much faster and easier process. The music tech startup has created an automated pre-cleared licensing platform and a marketplace for original music that removes all the friction of negotiating and lets creators and storytellers instantly license premium songs for their content. The platform also has a music discovery feature and a dynamic pricing model that instantly gives clients a quote for any type of use. Already the young company has signed agreements with over 60 labels and publishers, fully pre-clearing the music and is continuously adding more songs. Big ad agencies like McCann and Forsman Bodenfors have already used Freshsound’s platform for their campaigns. Stephen Gyasi, CEO & co-founder of Freshsound, said: “The sync and licensing market is still stuck in the pen and paper era, and is yet to be digitized. While it is growing and we see an increased demand for quality music, the process of licensing songs is too complex and time consuming. This results in songwriters and artists losing out on potential profits, while creators and storytellers are missing the opportunity to get the perfect song for their visual content. We want to ensure that the rights holders remain in full control and ownership of their rights and to make it easier than ever to license premium music.” This new investment boost will enable the start-up to rapidly accelerate its commercial expansion, expand its catalogue, product development and R&D, and launch its licensing platform in the Nordics, Germany and UK. With a team already drawing from their experience at companies and record labels like Warner Music, V2 Music, Hipgnosis, Spotify, Epidemic Sound, EMI, Sony Music, iZettle, Dassault Systèmes and BCG, Freshsound will also use the fresh capital to continue onboarding exceptional talent to the company."

2022.7.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/copenhagen-based-onomondo-raises-e20-2-million-to-boost-connectivity-within-the-iot/,"Offering a platform that boosts connectivity and performance for asset-rich industries, Copenhagen-based Onomondo has raised about €20.2 million. The Danish team has created a single virtualised IoT network – reimagining existing infrastructure. Asset-rich industries such as transport, manufacturing and logistics have been turning to the Internet of Things (IoT) to manage supply chains, improve automation and drive efficiency. But, this digital transformation has come with many sticking points for the sector. Despite advances in the tech stack, connectivity, in particular, has been a major roadblock. Aiming to overcome this, Onomondo has raised €20.2 million in a new funding round led by Verdane. Currently, companies in asset-rich industries are generally relying on a patchwork of national telecom operators or Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs). This patchwork means enterprises cannot gain sufficient interoperability, visibility, or control over their connected assets on a global basis. Digital transformation is the future – there is virtually no industry that hasn’t already set down this path, and the manufacturing, transport and logistics sectors are no different. But to happen at scale, a fresh look at the technical and commercial architecture for IoT connectivity is needed. Onomondo is addressing this, having built a single virtualised IoT network, without reliance on the traditional operator network stack. Michael Karlsen, Co-Founder & CEO, and Henrik Aagaard, Co-Founder & CTO at Onomondo explained: “It’s interesting how the attention in IoT has traditionally centered around Hardware and Cloud. Connectivity was the commodity added in the end. We see a clear shift now towards the market asking for more from their connectivity solution. This trend will dramatically heighten the success rate of IoT and lower both complexity and barriers to entry. All of this will eventually benefit both people, profit, and planet. Onomondo and our recent momentum is a clear representation of this shift and we have found Verdane to be the perfect partner to help us deliver fully on this vision and accelerate our growth.” The Danish company, founded in 2012, has integrated more than 700 operators at the Radio Access Network (RAN) level across more than 180 countries, and, layered its API-based IoT platform on top. This means users gain granular, real-time insight into the performance of each connected device, allowing them to tap into their global grid and troubleshoot IoT devices from anywhere. Devices connected to Onomondo contain an interoperable SIM card, meaning assets can seamlessly move across national borders without the inherent complexity of roaming. Data is transferred directly across the Onomondo virtual network to one of the firm’s cloud partners (Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud and more), so enterprises can easily understand what is going on between devices and the network, through to the core network, and on to the IoT cloud from a single interface. Further, the platform includes a connectivity marketplace. This means that enterprises can set priorities based on cost, coverage and performance, empowering the platform to automatically select the best operator in any given location, at any given time. This feature prevents operator lock-in by offering the freedom to control precisely which networks devices connect to, as well as giving enterprises the flexibility to balance the quality of coverage and cost-optimization, depending on the use case. This new capital injection will be used to drive growth and meet the company’s planned projection of tripling its ARR in 2022 and 2023. Onomondo also plans to scale its team from 50 to 100 by the end of 2022, helping to expand its customer base, which currently includes the likes of Bosch, Carlsberg, and Maersk. Pål Malmros, Partner at Verdane, added: “Drawing from a deep understanding of traditional network infrastructure, Michael, Henrik and the Onomondo team is bringing a fresh, next-generation approach to the challenges the IoT market continues to face today. We are convinced that Onomondo’s solution has the potential to vastly accelerate global roll-out of IoT, as well as expand the total set of addressable use cases, and we look forward to partnering with the company to significantly accelerate the business’ expansion and growth internationally, drawing on the Verdane team’s experience from over 45 other software investments.”"
2022.7.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/pan-european-climentum-capital-to-launch-a-e150-million-fund-to-support-innovators-accelerating-the-green-transition/,"Aiming to supercharge Europe’s green transition by launching a new climate tech Fund, Climentum Capital is raising €150 million to invest in early-stage startups helping Europe become carbon neutral. As Europe continues on the journey to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, Climentum Capital has today announced it is launching a new €150 million Fund I. Europe’s ambitious journey to Net-Zero is reliant upon new innovations and tech-first approaches that can make society more sustainable and accelerate a green transition – and it’s a journey with a long way to go. This new fund is sure to be a pivotal part of getting us there. “Now is the time to invest in Climate Tech. We need to see results within the next decades and see momentum from all sides: governments and corporations are pushing for real change, the best talent is moving into the space and technology has developed massively”. Dörte Hirschberg. Founded in 2021, Climentum Capital is a pan-European venture with bases in Copenhagen, Berlin and Stockholm. The VC firm is investing in European startups that are dedicated to cutting down CO2 emissions in a concrete, measurable and sustainable way. This freshly launched fund aims to avoid millions of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, accelerating the transition to a sustainable future. It’s among the first article 9 funds in Europe, with a dedicated focus on CO2 emission reductions from day one. Stefan Maard commented: “There is a concrete value-add to both founders and investors. “Investors gain access to a cutting-edge Article 9 fund that delivers climate impacts and the associated data to help them achieve and report on their own climate and ESG targets. This is something that has resonated well with especially institutional and more forward-looking investors. Looking toward the founders, they are keen to work with truly mission-aligned investors that are also willing and able to help them mature on their own sustainability journeys – including documenting climate change impacts and leveraging that to access non-dilutive capital such as carbon credits, grants and ESG related project financing.” Further, with a double carry structure, Climentum is unique in the VC space in that it sets both financial and impact targets, meaning it is truly committed to investing in companies with genuine potential to make a difference to our planet. Stefan Maard: “The impact space needs investment vehicles that are fully competitive in the market. It’s the only way to bring sufficient leverage to the fight against global warming.” With this fund, ambitious founders looking to scale innovative climate tech will be supported. A total of 25 startups across Europe will be backed at late-Seed to Series A with tickets ranging from €1 million to €5 million. The key verticals are: next-generation renewables; food and agriculture; industry and manufacturing; buildings and architecture; transportation and mobility; and, waste and materials. Throughout Europe, there are several macro trends which are helping fuel more sustainable approaches – and climate tech is one of the forces supporting these changes. Consumer preferences and demands have changed – we are now more aware of the need to make more sustainable choices, and consumers are looking for more ethical, circular and regenerative products. In addition to this, corporate strategy is shifting, as companies need to respond to pressure to be more transparent on their carbon emissions and environmental impact. It created a boom in corporate spending veering towards sustainability and offsetting initiatives. Lastly, governments and wider socio-political contexts come into play here. With globally rising energy prices and a volatile energy market as a whole, there is a real need for countries to boost their green energy transition, and implement circular, renewable strategies. Climate innovation is fueling these movements and shifts in perspectives. Founding team member Morten Halborg, stated: “Mobilising institutional capital to invest in attractive, early-stage, and highly scalable European green innovation is mission-critical if we are to curb climate change in time.” The firm is also pioneering diversity in VC – with ⅖ of the founding partners being women. The founders all have extensive career experience in the climate tech space and bring a wealth of knowledge to the endeavour. The founding team of Dörte Hirschberg ( formerly Junior Partner at McKinsey and member of the Rocket Internet leadership team), Yoann Berno ( ex-silicon valley software engineer turned serial entrepreneur turned investor), Stefan Maard (ex-Novozymes sustainability & venturing leader), Morten Halborg (ex-Executive at Skandia ), and, the Stockholm GP (who is still to be announced but tipped to be a deep-tech woman VC investor with decades of experience in corporate and financial VC), represent a combined working experience in the VC and startup space of over 70 years. With deep corporate experience in asset management, innovation, acceleration/incubation, and sustainability, the team is uniquely positioned to support innovative startups shaking up the climate tech sector. Yoann Berno added: “We are absolute technophiles. We will be looking for needle-moving technologies and solutions that often stretch a bit from your ordinary ‘safe-zone’ investment opportunities we might see the generalist funds go for. Deep tech is not something we shy away from – quite the contrary.” The fund is backed by renowned corporate investors, banks, industrial conglomerates, prominent family offices and successful tech entrepreneurs – all sharing the ambition to combat climate change through investing in disruptive technologies. The first close has been secured successfully and the final close is expected for the end of 2022. Climate tech has been reported as one of Europe’s fastest-growing verticals at the moment. Fuelled by the pressing need to find solutions to this generation’s greatest challenge, climate innovation is big business. There are already 46 climate tech unicorns around the world and it’s a sector that is only growing in importance. The European climate ecosystem is in full swing, and Europe has a real chance to become a world leader in this sphere. This new fund will certainly play an important role in fueling this."
2022.7.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/reading-based-oxford-quantum-circuits-raises-e44-million-to-unlock-the-potential-of-quantum-computing/,"Quantum computing is regarded as an area of tech that has massive potential to address humanity’s greatest challenges. Today, UK-based company Oxford Quantum Circuits has just announced the first close of its Series A at about €44 million – the largest-ever Series A in quantum computing made in the UK, signalling strong confidence in the startup. Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that is regarded as holding the ability to shape future life on earth – solving challenges from climate change to drug discovery. It harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference and entanglement, to solve problems too complex for classical computers. It, therefore, has immense power to influence how we view the world and to bring about breakthrough discoveries. It’s still an emerging tech, but, with startups like Oxford Quantum Circuits, it is coming closer to our reach. Taking in the UK’s largest-ever Series A in quantum computing to date, Reading-based Oxford Quantum Circuits has picked up €44 million. The investment was co-led by Lansdowne Partners, one of Europe’s leading investment firms, and The University of Tokyo Edge Capital Partners (UTEC), Japan’s largest deeptech VC fund. British Patient Capital and existing investors Oxford Science Enterprises (OSE) and Oxford Investment Consultants (OIC) also participated. Founded in 2017, OQC’s patented 3D architecture, the Coaxmon, combines unparalleled scalability with world-class performance. In February 2022, the team launched its latest system Lucy, on Amazon Braket, making it the first European quantum company on AWS. lana Wisby, CEO of OQC, commented: “This initial close is the UK’s largest ever Series A in quantum computing, demonstrating the confidence our investors have in our ability to lead the global quantum industry. It’s testament to the significant technological and commercial progress we have achieved in recent months, thanks to our world-class team. It is also the first step in our international expansion, bringing quantum to our customers’ fingertips – wherever they are in the world.” Quantum computing has the potential to shape our future and improve people’s lives and has long been recognised as a matter of strategic national importance. British Patient Capital’s investment in the round is part of its wider ambition to cement the UK’s position as a science and technology superpower. Judith Hartley, CEO, British Patient Capital said: “The UK has long been at the forefront of global technology developments. Our investment in Oxford Quantum Circuits exemplifies our continued commitment to ensuring the UK stays at the forefront of deeptech innovation.

2022.7.6,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/munich-based-celus-secures-e25-million-to-supercharge-its-mission-to-automate-electronics-design/,"Using AI to streamline circuit board engineering, Munich-based deeptech startup CELUS has just secured €25 million – supercharging its mission to tap into a trillion-dollar market. Within every electronic product – whether it be a toothbrush, coffee machine or a computer – there is a circuit board that can contain anywhere between hundreds and thousands of tiny hardware components. Each of these pieces has its own specifications, price and availability. Currently, these circuit boards are designed manually, reliant upon the expert knowledge of highly-skilled engineers. But CELUS is on a mission to change this – using AI to streamline and automate the process. The German deeptech startup, founded in 2018, has just secured €25 million Series A funding in a round led by Earlybird Venture Capital, with participation from DI Capital and existing investors Speedinvest and Plug and Play. Additionally participating in the oversubscribed round, and who will now join the expert advisory board, are Sir John Rose (former CEO of Rolls Royce); Sir Peter Bonfield (Chairman of TSMC and NXP); Carl-Peter Forster (CEO of Opel, GM Europe, and Tata Motors); Paul Gojenola (Electronic Engineering Lead at Google); Martina Koederitz (former CEO of IBM Germany and Global Industry Business); and Koenraad Crooijmans (former Investment Banker at Morgan Stanley). Founded by Tobias Pohl (CEO), Alexander Pohl (CTO) and André Alcalde (CPO), CELUS’s vision is to open new levels of efficiency and quality assurance to electronic engineering professionals, distributors, and component manufacturers alike. Circuit board design traditionally has relied on manual design – making the process of getting to the final design and component selection complex and time-consuming. CELUS CEO, Tobias, explained: “Engineers spend far too much time relying on their memories, or manually searching parts that might serve a certain function. CELUS changes the game, providing engineers with the digital tools to dramatically speed up this process and automate much of the hard work.” CELUS has developed a cloud-based engineering platform that supports electronics engineers with rich component data from electronic manufacturers and adds automation to accelerate the design process. It’s reported that this leads to a design-time reduction of up to 90%. With the industry facing severe chip shortages, new components are being introduced and old components are becoming obsolete. CELUS makes the design of electronics accessible to many more engineers, facilitating direct information flows between electronic component manufacturers and their customers. Given that every electronic product we use relies on such component design and selection, the startup is tapping into a massive market and has great potential to thrive. Andre Retterath, Partner at Earlybird, who is joining the CELUS board, said: “The electronic supply shortages triggered by Covid have, more than ever before, revealed the faultiness of one of the largest and most important global industries. Having observed this market for several years, we strongly believe that CELUS, with its engineer-first approach, is best positioned to lead the horizontal integration of the broken and fragmented electronics supply chain – enabled by design automation.” Sir John Rose commented: “CELUS’ entry into the electronics engineering market is extraordinarily well-timed and important for the industry. Acquiring components for circuit board design and creation became increasingly difficult during the Covid-19 pandemic, but CELUS’ technology sweeps away many of these obstacles from an engineer’s design path. I am delighted to be joining the company’s advisory board and can’t wait to help CELUS achieve its vast, global potential.” More than 1,800 engineers are already using the CELUS tool – a 3,000% increase compared with December 2021. This investment will be used to further scale this rapid growth, with a strong focus on the US market. It’ll also go towards strengthening the commercial team and enlarging the tech leadership. Speaking on these future plans, Tobias added: “This fresh round of funding, and the support from top-tier investors and our prestigious active advisory board, allows us to grow our user base globally and open a CELUS office in the US – positioning us in the heart of the electronics industry. We want to reach every electronics designer out there, enabling them to focus more time on innovation and creativity, while our software reduces the tedious and time-consuming tasks they were dealing with before.”"
2022.7.6,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/danish-firm-unconventional-ventures-launches-e30-million-fund-to-invest-in-impact-tech-companies-with-diverse-teams/,"A pioneering European fund has been launched today, helping diversify the face of Europe’s VC scene. Danish firm Unconventional Ventures has launched a €30 million fund – targeting diverse founding teams that are building impactful tech companies. Built and backed by a diverse pool of investors and advisors, Unconventional Ventures are shaking up Europe’s VC space for good – and have made an announcement today that marks an important step towards diversifying and improving Europe’s investment scene. The Danish firm has launched a new €30 million fund that will increase investment into founders identifying as women, POC, immigrants and/or LGTBQ+, who are building impact tech companies with an ESG lens. And it’s attracted a lot of attention from key players in the Nordic investment landscape. Rolf Kjærgaard, CEO at Vaekstfonden, said: “We at Vaekstfonden want to ensure equality and diversity, including, but not limited to, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality. Because when we as investors contribute with financial capital, we have both an opportunity, as well as a responsibility, to create change. As part of our scaled efforts, we, therefore, see a large potential in Unconventional Ventures and in their mission. They can help create change and push to enable the ecosystems of the Nordics in creating the companies of the future, that are founded and run by diverse teams. We want to work towards that goal, both because it is the right thing to do, but also because experience shows that companies that are diverse are more innovative and produce larger returns.” The fund will enable Unconventional Ventures to act broadly, giving investments in both the pre-seed and seed stages. Priority will be given to the conviction that diversity, impact and growth are interconnected in the investment – giving this fund an inspiring new “investment-for-good” model. Claus Gregersen, Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, added: “We are excited to be part of Unconventional Ventures, which is our eleventh impact investment and the first one specifically targeting diversity. Despite talent being evenly distributed across genders, ethnicities and sexualities, diverse founders receive only a small share of VC funding. We believe the team has the drive and dedication to lead this impact-focused venture fund and add real value to diverse founder teams. For this reason, we are delighted to be an anchor investor in Unconventional Ventures.” Additionally, Terje Eidesmo, CEO at Investinor, has commented: “As Norway’s largest venture capital investor, Investinor is building the businesses of tomorrow. The business case for diversity and inclusion is stronger than ever, and we are very happy to be supporting Unconventional Ventures on their important mission. Investing in diversity is not only the right thing to do, but can also result in better financial performance”. Not only does the aim of the fund sound good in writing, but with the support of these big names in the Nordic investment space, the firm is evidently on to something here. Since 2019, UV has been led by General Partners Thea Messel and Nora Bavey. Its team is made up of a diverse pool of investors and advisors, all with extensive experience and a broad range of perspectives. The company has over the years been creating investment vehicles to unlock the potential of diverse founding teams – teams which are far too often overlooked and underserved. Thea Messel, founder and GP at UV, said: “It’s always been our conviction that the combination of diversity and sustainability constitutes the most substantial investment opportunity – in the Nordics and globally. With this new fund, we will have the financial force to back many of the fantastic founders we have met over the years, who are building companies creating a better future for all of us.” UV’s annual reports on the funding gap in the Nordic investment landscape are widespread and in early 2021 they launched the first digital European accelerator program targeting underrepresented founders. With this new fund, UV is ready to accelerate the work of unleashing the untapped potential of tech companies built by diverse founding teams, with a particular focus on solutions for climate, health, education, and inclusive fintech. Nora Bavey, co-founder and GP at UV, added: “As a first time fund, we are particularly proud of the diverse group of investors backing the fund, varying from institutional investors to recognised international VC funds and progressive Family offices being frontrunners in impact investment, to successful entrepreneurs.” It’s a pioneering fund, one of Europe’s first to have a clear focus on both backing diverse founding teams and companies having a positive impact, either of environmental or social impact, at the core of their business model – and it’s both refreshing and inspiring to see."
2022.7.6,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/fintech-startups-promoting-financial-inclusion-interview-with-pave-founder-sho-sugihara/,"Founded in 2017, UK-based Pave is building the proper path to good credit. Through a tech-first approach, the startup helps customers improve their credit score and history with bill monitoring and credit building. As the cost-of-living crisis and effects of the looming recession are adversely impacting consumers, financial inclusion products like Pave are needed more than ever. People are increasingly looking for financial help to navigate these turbulent waters, and fintech innovation is leading the way forward. As a testament to its value as a fintech-for-good, Pave already has almost 500k registered users and is making an impact in stopping the financial inequality that is spreading across the UK and Europe. Sho Sugihara is the founder & CEO of Pave. Born in Japan, Sho has had experience working with NGOs around the world and is driven by the desire to build a world free of financial inequality, making the space more inclusive and accessible. We caught up with Sho to learn more about Pave’s founding story, navigating a pivot and different challenges, as well as delving into financial inclusion and how fintechs can be impact-driven. How did your personal and professional experiences prior to founding Pave shape you to be the founder that you are today? I grew up in Japan, where my first job was delivering magazines to homeless vendors in Osaka city for The Big Issue. That was the moment I started thinking about social finance. At 18, I went to Brazil to work for an entrepreneur who had set up an NGO providing financial and educational support to disadvantaged communities in São Paulo. I saw the impact that one person could have on the lives of many and was deeply inspired by that. From that point, I wanted to build my own business with a focus on solving inequality. I worked at McKinsey for three years after university to save up cash to start my own venture. Eventually, I co-founded Pave out of Entrepreneur First in 2017 with Chris Butcher.  The desire to solve systemic inefficiencies and eliminate unjust financial exclusion continues to be my biggest motivation to this day.  You met your co-founder, Chris, at Entrepreneur First. Why do you think it’s important to have a co-founder when starting a company? As exciting as it sounds, founding your own company can be incredibly intense and daunting. It’s nice to have someone to share the journey with, who can give you moral support throughout – like Chris did for me. More practically, Chris had expertise in areas that I do not, which helped round out the skill sets within the company. It’s particularly important to build self-awareness around both your strengths and weaknesses and co-found with someone who can offset these. What were you looking for in a co-founder? What advice do you have for someone looking for a co-founder? You need to have a co-founder that you get on with at a personal level and respect, who has skills they bring to the table. If you often have contrasting opinions on things, that can be challenging but productive too. It really does mirror a romantic relationship in many ways! You will go through inevitable ups and downs and have mounting frustrations over the small things they do which can sometimes explode. But if the foundations are built on personal care and respect, all of this can be worked out with patience and lots of communication. If you don’t have those foundations, it’s much harder to want to get through these challenges. On the flip side, if you get along too well and agree on everything all the time, you probably aren’t addressing the toughest issues or lack diversity in thought which could lead to bad business outcomes. You really need someone you are willing to face all the difficulties with head on, which is why I think you have to like and respect the person so you can get through it all. Could you tell us more about the journey and thought process behind the pivot and rebrand from Portify to Pave? We started Portify in 2017 to help gig economy workers better manage their finances with Open Banking and improve their financial well-being. During the pandemic in 2020, we did over one hundred in-depth customer interviews to understand what it meant for them. We learned that for the first time, a lot of our customers had managed to free up cash flow because of lockdown and furlough payments. There was a surge in demand for credit building services as people started considering long-term financial aspirations like a mortgage. We rapidly shifted our attention towards providing credit-building products, and that took off. It required tough decisions like axing some of the lucrative contracts we had at the time to re-focus our resources, but it worked out.  As cliché as it sounds, I would say the key to successful pivots is speaking to your customers and understanding their evolving needs while committing to bold decisions quickly even if painful.  Earlier this year, we went through a rebrand from Portify to Pave to finalise our commitment to this new direction and prove there’s a better way to build credit than getting into more debt. By offering tools, education and support, we offer the proper path to good credit. Could you share what are some of the hardest challenges you faced with scaling Pave? There were numerous challenges around scaling the business, but the most challenging that comes to mind were around changes of direction, and bringing the team along with those decisions when you have minimal proof points that things are going to work out. That requires empathy, conviction, open communication, and a lot of legwork from the team. The other challenge I’ve found is building a productive team. In particular, leadership team building can be challenging. Given our social mission we don’t struggle hiring good people, but making sure they are a good fit, delegating tasks effectively, and building a productive dynamic within that team requires a lot of trust building and discipline. Finally, as a founder often it’s difficult to fully delegate work to the team. Everything feels important, and it’s hard to let go of things, especially if it’s your first business. But to create a productive and motivated team it’s key to do so, and this is a challenge I’m always trying to get better at. As Pave has grown, how has your role as the founder/CEO evolved and how have you navigated that? At the very early stages (sub 10 employees), you have to do absolutely everything and be like a swiss army knife. I did everything from running payroll, negotiating contracts, issuing employee stock options, doing our accounts, to running Facebook ads. Frankly, I overdid it! One of the best things we did as a company was to hire an executive assistant after our second funding round when we were a team of closer to 20. This changed my life as they took all the routine work off my plate and helped me focus on the bigger picture, and preserve energy to make key decisions. I wish we’d done this much earlier, I don’t think it’s at all unreasonable for founders to hire someone like this even at the sub-10 people stage and would recommend it. Now, my role is much more focused on strategy, communication and motivating the team. I spend a lot more time with our board and leadership team, making sure we’re aligned and working towards a common vision. I still occasionally step in to execute the groundwork if we’re short-staffed, but I try not to. Strangely, this has meant that I have more free time as the company has grown, and this frequently comes with a sense of guilt! But I think that’s natural. Overall, the best thing for the company as it frees up my time to anticipate the key moves we need to make and reflect on the bigger picture. What is the current status of financial inclusion in the UK today? I think there are two main issues that stand in the way of broader financial inclusion in the UK today. The first is at an overall economic and social level. Since the 1970s, we’ve seen wages grow at a slower rate compared to GDP. This means that wealth has concentrated in the hands of fewer people, growing income and therefore financial inequality. We’re not doing enough to address this macro issue as a society right now, which concerns me. Secondly, many of the core practices we carry out in the consumer credit sector remain inefficient, resulting in a large segment of consumers losing access to fair financial products, causing further inequality. One example that comes to mind in the consumer credit sector is how we do credit checks. The data we use today for credit assessments is incomplete. Most companies carry out credit checks looking at your credit file to decide whether to give you credit. The problem is that 1 in 5 people say there are errors on their credit files, and around 10 million people in the UK have said they’ve found errors. This means that we’re not making the best decisions because we’re using incomplete data, and that can cause unfair exclusion. Technology like Open Banking could help improve the situation, but we need to do a lot more to make it mainstream adopted. There are more inefficiencies that I can think of, but these, coupled with widening inequality at the societal level are what I believe leads to 1 in 5 Brits saying they feel locked out of the financial system – that’s close to 11 million people. So, when it comes to financial inclusion in the UK, I think there’s a lot more to be done. What are some “fintech for good” startups that you are excited about? I’m a big fan of Nubank. They started out in Brazil and provided access to core banking services and credit to millions of people. Having lived there and worked with people who were excluded from the financial system, I know they solve a real problem with respect to inequality, so I’m excited about the impact they are having. I also think Goldfinch is up to interesting things. I’m aware there is a crypto gloom phase going on, but I think their business model remains smart, and their vision for decentralised off-chain lending has the potential to massively reduce the cost of borrowing for millions of underserved people in developing countries. What do the next few years look like for fintechs working on improving financial inclusion?  It’s more important than ever that we focus on financial inclusion as fintechs.  The cost of borrowing is starting to rise in tandem with the cost of living. More and more consumers are going to need fair financial products to get through the next few years, and then rebuild their finances in the years after. We must come together as a sector and bring products to market that will support them, even if that comes at a risk to businesses. I’d love to see more founders entering this sector, and I’m always open to conversations to explore ideas – feel free to DM me on Linkedin! Tell us more about what’s next for Pave? As mentioned, more and more people in the UK are resorting to credit products to cope with the current income shock and cost of living crisis. We will continue to improve our app to support our B2C customers in upkeeping their credit health. At the same time, we are also launching B2B credit analytics services with our platform, Fuse. Over the past year, multiple fintechs approached us looking to get support on credit analytics and lending. Our benchmarking and research indicated our analytics capabilities were top-notch compared to what was out there. Fuse will bring businesses an all-in-one platform for assessing customer cash flow, affordability and credit worthiness to help them get better lending products to market more efficiently. We think this is a key step to take at a critical time to widen the impact we can have and achieve our mission of bringing millions more people into a fair financial system."
2022.7.6,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/french-insurtech-startup-orus-locks-in-e5-million-to-reinvent-professional-insurances-for-smes/,"In just one year since its launch, Paris-based insurtech startup Orus has raised €5 million. The company is aiming to reinvent professional insurance for small businesses, providing a tailored service to underserved players. The insurance world might traditionally be associated with suits and paperwork, but insurtech innovators are on hand to digitize the sector, spicing it up and making insurance 21st century ready. Personal insurance products have been enjoying a lot of success in digitisation, with the emergence of 100% digital palters such as Luko, Leocare, Lovys and Acheel. However, the professional insurance sector remains dominated by more stagnant, traditional players. That is, until now. Paris-based startup Orus is on a mission to address the professional insurance market with a tech-first approach. It’s an industry worth an estimated €70 billion and in dire need of some tech improvements. The startup has just raised €5 million to shake up the market, in a funding round that saw participation from Frst, Partech, Portage Ventures and around twenty business angels such as Pierre-Olivier Desaulle (ex-CEO of Hiscox Europe), Raphaël Vullierme (CEO of Luko), Christophe Triquet (ex-founder of MeilleureAssurance) and Arthur Waller (CEO of Pennylane). Major insurances have generally neglected the SME market, deeming it too costly to serve these companies with products and services specific to each of their activities. As a result, 24 million European small companies (99% of all businesses) are still struggling to find simple, flexible and tailored offers. From this neglect, the idea for Orus came about.It was developed by Côme Dartiguenave, Tom Le Bras, and Samuel Rossille in May 2021. Côme Dartiguenave, co-founder and CEO of Orus, explained: “We believe that insurance is a social good to protect businesses. SMEs are the lifeblood of our economy and must be able to access the most suitable offer for their needs. Our mission is to create simple, efficient and affordable insurance to allow professionals to focus on what matters.” The Parisian insurtech has decided to go against the grain of traditional insurers by creating exclusive products dedicated to each sector of activity and offering a 100% digital, fluid and transparent customer experience. The first offer, aimed at restaurant owners, is co-constructed with the insurer Wakam. It allows customers to purchase insurance directly online in less than 5 minutes, without any commitment and with all the essential guarantees brought together under a single policy. It includes a common base of guarantees (such as general liability, theft, fire, water damage, electrical damage, etc.) as well as some options such as legal protection and business interruption. Côme Dartiguenave, added: “Our technology will allow us to offer products, assistance and prevention services to many small businesses, with a seamless experience and affordable prices.” Alongside creating a competitive product that can be calculated in real-time, the insurtech is focusing its energies on providing top-notch customer service. Through the development of its own back-office, specific internal tools and the automation of various processes, customer care agents can save time – meaning they can better advise and support policyholders during the key steps of the process. Already, the young company has several dozen restaurant owners trusting the team to insure their businesses 100% online. Today’s freshly announced funding will fuel expansion and help onboard new clients. The startup also intends to develop new products in the coming months in order to rapidly cover most business sectors and become a leader in professional insurance in Europe. Alison Imbert, Principal at Partech, said: “Orus is tackling the professional insurance market, which is more complex than others due to the multitude of insurance products, but also generates more value. Customers are more loyal and willing to pay a fair price for an efficient and transparent service. Orus has assembled an exceptional and complementary team to build a competitive product that is tailored to the many needs of its customers.”"
2022.7.6,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/amsterdam-based-baserow-bags-e5-million-to-create-a-no-code-toolchain/,"The demand for no-code solutions has been skyrocketing and innovative startups are leading the way. Building a collaborative no-code database platform, Dutch startup Baserow has just secured €5 million to launch its premium and enterprise versions. In recent years, low-code and no-code tools have seen steady growth in popularity, due to their effectiveness in addressing complex business challenges and their inherent simplicity to implement. As sectors have raced to digitise, low-code and no-code tools have helped businesses digitise workflows, automate processes and improve business efficiencies Providing a collaborative no-code database platform, Amsterdam-based Baserow has just bagged €5 million in Seed funding to launch its paid premium and enterprise versions in Q3 2022 and build what is the world’s first open-source, all-in-one, no-code toolchain. The platform enables non-technical teams to capture and organize data to trigger intelligent business insights and automate processes. The investment was led by Inkef and firstminute capital, Seedcamp and Frontline also participated. Several angel investors such as Job van der Voort from Remote, Martin Henk from Pipedrive and Shannon Williams from Rancher Labs took part as well. Before the rise of low-code and no-code tools, organisations had to rely on software developers with deep technical skills to digitise. With the increased need to digitise in recent years, coupled with a lack of skilled developers, alternative solutions have been needed. And that is where the likes of Baserow come in. Today, no-code solutions mean any user, regardless of their experience, can create workable applications collaboratively, quickly and efficiently. According to Gartner, 70% of new applications developed by organisations will use low code or no-code technologies by 2025 – making this a market with enormous potential. Frank Lansink, Partner at Inkef, said: “We are delighted to invest in Baserow as we are firm believers of the team’s vision to build a full no-code toolchain on the basis of a scalable database. No-code adoption in the enterprise is really still in its infancy with predominantly point solutions and no real winners yet.” The startup, co-founded in 2021 by Bram Wiepjes, was developed when Bram started a side project in which he developed an open-source database spreadsheet hybrid platform to help users curate and make sense of data within their organisations. The software was designed for non-technical users across organisations – from HR and marketing to finance and operations departments – to quickly and efficiently build personalised applications with a scalable database. Unlike other players in the sector, Baserow is an open-source platform offering customers the choice of SaaS or self-hosting solutions, freeing users from vendor lock-in. Furthermore, users can customise the platform with personalised plug-ins which gives customers complete freedom to own and manage the applications they develop. As an API-first platform, Baserow integrates seamlessly with any tool needed to build a no-code stack. Finally, Baserow is designed for scale to remain fast and stable at huge volumes of data. Arek Wylegalski, Partner at firstminute capital, added: “Baserow is the tool that modern knowledge workers need. We believe that Baserow will be very popular across both the public and private sectors. Privacy is more important than ever. Baserow offers unparalleled privacy without compromising on ease of use and flexibility.” Since the launch of the company in 2021, Baserow has garnered over 20k sign-ups and boasts more than 10k active users. It’s gained steady traction in the open-source community, with users building back-end databases for mobile applications, running AI/ML models on top of the no-code database, or organising marketing campaigns with many stakeholders. Olivier Maes, Co-Founder and CRO of Baserow, explained: “Baserow has found that businesses in the private and public sector space want to leverage no-code tools to create applications, manage data and automate processes for greater productivity, improve citizen services, drive faster time to market metrics and lower costs. With Baserow, customers get the best of both worlds: user-friendly no-code tools with the openness and flexibility of the open-source model. This unique proposition ensures businesses can avoid the general vendor lock-in models available in the marketplace.” Now, with this new funding, the startup will launch its paid premium and enterprise versions. The premium paid version will provide users with additional features including row colouring, row comments, and additional data export formats. Meanwhile, the enterprise version will offer features such as robust user management, role-based access control and access to the enterprise team support. Bram Wiepjes, Co-Founder and CEO of Baserow, said: “As we launch our commercial offering, we will continue to focus on the needs of our users who want to leverage our platform to manage their business critical processes, but are limited by data governance, scalability and security constraints that make existing SaaS only tools difficult to adopt. This successful seed round will inject additional capital to expand our developer team to further develop the application builder and workflow automation modules.”"
2022.7.7,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/barcelona-based-flexidao-raises-e6-3-million-to-enable-24-7-clean-energy/,"As companies and governments increasingly adopt carbon-free energy solutions, Barcelona-based cleantech startup FlexiDAO has raised over €6.1 million for its round-the-clock electricity and carbon tracking capabilities. Achieving net-zero and moving to cleaner, carbon-free energy sources is of top priority to different governments, organisations and businesses around the world.l From the EU aiming to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 to Google’s ambitions to be carbon-free – there are many different strategies in place to move towards energy sources that are healthier and more sustainable. With a goal to provide the software that will make these aims achievable, Barcelona-based FlexiDAO has secured more than €6.1 million in fresh funding. The round was led by SET Ventures, with investment from Google and the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund. Existing investor EIT InnoEnergy also participated. Founded in 2017, FlexiDAO offers software tools for companies and organisations to monitor the renewable energy they buy and the associated carbon emissions hour-by-hour and 24/7. It, therefore, empowers clients to operate on round-the-clock carbon-free energy, by certifying and tracing their electricity and its true carbon content, every hour of every day. Simone Accornero, CEO and co-founder of FlexiDAO said: “If we don’t act now by pushing breakthrough technologies that decarbonise every electron, every hour of every day, we will never meet decarbonisation targets.” With the realisation that climate action is an imperative we all need to take responsibility for – and need to take action on now – more than a third of the world’s largest publicly traded companies now have net-zero targets. Couple this with increasing pressure on companies for transparent reporting of their emissions to drive decarbonisation and there becomes a market need for tools that help companies get to carbon neutrality. And this need has been growing. As Simone Accornero, CEO and co-founder of FlexiDAO said: “If we don’t act now by pushing breakthrough technologies that decarbonise every electron, every hour of every day, we will never meet decarbonisation targets.” However, by and large, companies lack the tools to accurately calculate and reduce the carbon footprint of their electricity. Indeed, few companies know if the “green” electricity they already buy is really carbon-free, every hour and in every location. The reality is, that signing up for 100% renewable energy contracts does not guarantee carbon-free energy. Existing schemes used to certify and report the carbon footprint of electricity usage match a company’s energy demand with renewable energy on a global and annual basis. This doesn’t account for the real world’s geographical constraints and the hourly, or daily, fluctuations where electricity may come from fossil fuels, such as when there is not enough wind or solar power available. This means a company procuring “100% renewable” energy may receive fossil fuel power depending on its location and the time of day, month or year. It’s an issue that puts plans to reach carbon neutrality in jeopardy. And these plans are crucial in the fight against climate change and the escalating climate crisis. Maud Texier, Global Head of Clean Energy Development at Google explained: “As Google and others move towards 24/7 carbon-free energy, we need new capabilities that enable us to track with credibility how the carbon-free electricity produced matches what is consumed.” It’s echoed by Brandon Middaugh, Director of the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, who said: Last year, Microsoft announced its 100/100/0 vision and commitment to have 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon sources by 2030. We know that to achieve this goal, we will need innovative solutions like FlexiDAO that will help reliably track and verify carbon-free energy consumption”. FlexiDAO´s software platform uses blockchain technology to certify and trace electricity from production to consumption, to enable credible and verifiable claims on its carbon footprint, every hour of the day. This enables customers to understand the origin and carbon footprint of the energy they consume across their operations and take action to procure cleaner electricity and drive decarbonisation of their operations, making 24/7 carbon-free energy a reality. By measuring the hourly match between energy consumption and the green energy purchased, FlexiDAO customers can verify progress towards their net-zero ambitions. Electricity suppliers can increase customer engagement by providing more transparent information on the carbon footprint of their power – so it’s a real win-win. Extended across an economy, this transparency and accountability will support the growth of 24/7 carbon-free electricity grids, benefiting everyone. René Savelsberg of SET Ventures commented: “As an early investor in FlexiDAO we could see the potential of the growing market demand for their solution. We are very glad that this has been confirmed by Google and Microsoft not only being key customers but now also investors, leading the path for the successful acceleration of FlexiDAO.24/7 carbon-free energy is a huge area of growth. FlexiDAO’s platform addresses a real business need with the potential to scale to meet the global challenge. We believe this could set the scene for a 24/7 carbon-free energy marketplace this decade and accelerate decarbonisation of the electricity grid.” The Barcelonian startup will use the new investment to expand its services, making carbon neutrality a reality across the world. Already present in 13 counties, the company plans to continue growth in its core US and European markets. It will also put the funding towards developing new technology to ensure it stays in line with any upcoming changes regarding emissions reporting regulations. Simone Accornero indeed: “This investment is a significant milestone for FlexiDAO, but also for the wider 24/7 carbon-free energy market. With our new partners, we can expand our global footprint and our product-portfolio, offering solutions to support companies through their journey to 100% carbon-free energy. This includes the trading and procurement of granular hourly certificates for clean energy, helping customers accelerate their transition to net zero.”"
2022.7.7,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/london-based-yulife-secures-over-e117-million-for-its-insurtech-inspiring-people-to-live-their-best-lives/,"Insurtech startup YuLife has just locked in more than €117 million of fresh funding. The London-based startup takes a refreshing approach to insurance, driven by impact and an aim to empower people to live their best lives. Signing up for a health insurance policy doesn’t scream excitement – rather protection and sensible long-term thinking. On a mission to make insurance about rewarding yourself instead, London-based YuLife has today announced it has raised more than €117 million in Series C funding. The funding was led by Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (TSE: 8750) (“Dai-ichi Life”), a new strategic investor in the company. It was also supported by YuLife’s existing investors which include Creandum, LocalGlobe, Target Global, Latitude, Anthemis, OurCrowd, Notion, MMC and Eurazeo. The insurance industry is reported to be worth trillions of dollars. But, it’s largely perceived to be stuck in the past, to be stagnant, and to be in need of a fresh face. Couple this image with a global well-being crisis, and there’s a major gap in the market to provide something new and revive the insurance market for the realities of the current world. That’s what YuLife want to do. Sammy Rubin, CEO and Founder, YuLife, explained: “Insurance has the potential to achieve tremendous social good. Unusually for financial services, our product creates a deep alignment of interests between the insurer, the company and the individual. We believe that wellbeing must be holistic, and we are committed to building a global financial services brand that can change the lives of millions of people across the world.” Founded in 2016, YuLife is a tech-driven insurance provider on a mission to inspire life and is driven by an impact and desire to be a force for good. By combining technology with behavioural science, YuLife’s insurance model focuses on risk prevention, not just compensation. It then rewards people for healthy living, supporting mental, physical and financial well-being to foster healthier and happier communities and workplaces. Sammy Rubin added: “Companies that choose YuLife are making a statement that they care deeply about their employees. Now more than ever it is important for companies to go above and beyond to build a culture of care in the workplace, as traditional benefits packages just do not do the job. Our proposition addresses a vital business need exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ‘Great Resignation’.” The London-based startup is shaking up the insurance market, creating a new ‘win-win’ model which benefits individuals, businesses and society. The game-like YuLife app enables policyholders to complete everyday wellness activities in order to earn YuCoin – which can then be used to buy gifts for themselves, friends or family, or even to improve the world through offsetting, planting trees or donating to charity. The company reports that more than a third of customers engage with the platform every single day – showing how it has become more than just an insurance product, but a tool to foster new habits. Further, according to YuLife, 87% of clients report an improvement in their well-being as a result of having YuLife as their insurer. YuLife’s flagship product, group life insurance, has achieved rapid traction in a market lacking in innovation and the company has reported more than 5x growth in Gross Written Premiums year-on-year. YuLife now covers more than 500k policyholders across small to large businesses. Toshiaki Sumino, Director, Managing Executive Officer, Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc, said: “YuLife has immense potential to build on its achievements to date, and we are thrilled to invest and help propel YuLife towards its next steps and scale its global operations. YuLife shares our ethos of harnessing the latest trends in technology to make a genuine difference to the lives of those using financial products.” This fresh capital boost will be used to broaden the firm’s reach into new global markets and scale its product range, delivering financial products that improve lives and reward wellbeing. This furthers the company’s ambition of transforming financial services into a force for good."

2022.7.7,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/london-based-fintech-startup-griffin-banks-e15-million-for-its-self-service-baas-platform/,"Aiming to become the banking and finance partner of choice for fintechs, London-based Banking-as-a-Service startup Griffin has just announced a raise of about €15 million. The startup has created a bank that financial companies can build on – bringing self-service software to the sector. London’s fintech space is continuing to bring hot innovations, exciting startups and fresh approaches to finance. Taking a new perspective to Banking-as-a-Service, Griffin is rebuilding banking tech infrastructure from the ground up – bringing fintech organisations a self-service platform to easily embed financial services directly into their product. The startup has just raised €15 million in fresh capital. The round was led by Notion Capital, with participation from existing investor EQT Ventures as well as fintech angels including William Hockey, co-founder of Plaid and founder and co-CEO of Column, Nilan Peiris, VP of Growth at Wise, Rob Straathof, CEO at Liberis and Shane Happach, CEO of Mollie and ex CCO Worldpay. Griffin also welcomes Notion Capital co-founder and managing partner Stephen Chandler to its board of directors. Founded in 2017, Griffin wants to become the bank that fintechs can build on. The company is building a full-stack integrated BaaS platform, powered by modern user-friendly technology. The idea is that it will make it simple for fintech organisations to embed financial products, letting them instead focus on building products for their customers, rather than managing complex back-end infrastructure and compliance operations. Stephen Chandler, Managing Partner at Notion Capital said: “SaaS is finally eating the financial services sector the way it has every other industry, and Griffin will empower fintechs to build and launch financial products with a single secure and modern SaaS platform.” Founded by Silicon Valley engineers David Jarvis and Allen Rohner (who co-founded tech unicorn CircleCI) and a team of banking and technology executives from the Bank of England, the startup has also just submitted its application to the PRA and the FCA to become an authorised bank. By doing so, the startup differentiates itself in the market. Becoming a bank would enable Griffin to offer banking services and a more comprehensive BaaS platform than middleware competitors. Griffin’s vision is to be a stable, long-term banking partner for innovative fintechs who often struggle with long, expensive onboarding processes and integration with legacy tech at established banks. Together, the application to become a bank alongside this fresh funding, show the company is well on its way to fulfilling this aim. Tom Mendoza, EQT Ventures partner and Griffin board member added: “The financial services industry has not kept pace with consumer trends and tech innovation, creating demand for a developer-friendly bank built on modern APIs and intuitive software. Griffin aims to challenge the status quo by offering a full-stack banking platform that will make it fast, simple, and cost-effective for brands to launch financial products.” Since its last funding round in 2020, the fintech firm has tripled in size and begun commercialising its platform, currently available for exclusive early access. This new round of investment will be used to grow the leadership and operational teams and continue the build of the core banking platform. David Jarvis, Griffin CEO and co-founder commented: “With this injection of funding, we can continue to innovate, scale our business, and focus on building the best banking platform possible.”"
2022.7.7,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/paris-based-hors-normes-cooks-up-e7-million-to-tackle-food-waste/,"Set on tackling an escalating food waste crisis, French startup Hors Normes has just raised €7 million to save rejected fruit and vegetables. The Paris-based startup has been gaining traction since its launch for its win-win approach to addressing waste. Food waste is a growing problem and one of the contributing factors is an obsession with perfectionism – the belief that our fruit and vegetables have to be in the perfect shape and look pretty enough to hit the stalls. In reality, this means that every day, far too much quality (and often organic) produce is wasted – rejected by traditional retail channels. On a quest to save rejected fruit and vegetables, and instead deliver them directly to consumers, Paris-based startup Hors Normes has just bagged €7 million. The fresh seed funding saw a new shareholder, Project A (a German Venture Capital fund) take a share in the company’s capital along with the company’s historic shareholder, Stride VC (UK). Currently present in Paris, Lyon and Marseille, Hors Normes has already won over about 7k regular customers since its 2020 creation. In just two years, the startup has built solid foundations to ensure sustainable development and has established a long-term economic relationship of benefit to both producers and consumers. It recovers the rejected share of inventory from producers and offers its products for sale directly to consumers at a price up to 40% lower. Economically this is a win/win relationship, which also has the merit of contributing to reducing the carbon footprint of our food since food wastage alone accounts for nearly 8% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. To date, the company has saved some 400 tonnes of produce – which highlights just how much food we waste, as well as the massive potential there is to do something about it. With this new funding, the startup aims to consolidate its service and accelerate its deployment in France and abroad in order to multiply the number of regular customers by 8 by the end of 2023 and save over 3,000 tons of products. This will be achieved by expanding to other French cities by the end of 2023. The company is also reviewing other European cities to expand into, developing new features and expanding the range of grocery products available. Sven Ripoche, co-founder of Hors Normes, said: “This second round of financing marks the start of a new stage in Hors Normes’ expansion. In just 2 years, we have managed to win over more than 7,000 customers and save more than 400 tonnes of food produce. We want to continue our mission: reduce food waste and make good quality products available to all. To do this, expanding our presence in France and abroad, and increasing our range of saved products will be our priorities for the next 24 months. Our action also has a positive social impact on French producers, since Hors Normes is an additional source of income for them.”"
2022.7.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/salto-x-picks-up-e5-2-million-to-build-tokenized-stock-options-for-remote-companies/,"With roots in Kyiv, Tallinn and Riga, Salto X is a pan-European startup reimagining stock options in Europe by connecting the Web2 and Web3 worlds. The startup just picked up €5.2 million to introduce its Incentive Tokens Plans to companies wanting to retain and recruit quality talent. Salto X, founded in 2021, is on a mission to build a remote-friendly alternative to stock options for European companies. The aim is that by doing so, they can provide a solution to retain talent globally amidst an uncertain economic climate and an increasing talent and skills shortage. The product offers a liquidity-friendly equity compensation alternative – particularly pertinent with many companies now looking to cut payroll costs. The young startup has just picked up €5.2 million in a seed funding round led by ByFounders and Blockwall. New York-based Box Group, crypto fintech 3Commas, and angels such as Liu Jiang (ex-Sequoia GP) & Alex Gluchkowski (Founder of ZkSync) also joined the round. The founding team of Krists Avots, Ragnar Sass, Tanya Chaikovska and Elise Sass bring vast entrepreneurial experience to the venture, each bringing individual investment and community-building backgrounds. Ragnar Sass is the co-founder of unicorn startup Pipedrive, where he saw first-hand the difficulty of managing stock options internationally. Ragnar is now the CEO of Salto X and explained the vision: “The existing model discriminates against remote employees, which is not acceptable in the remote-first world. They either get a worse deal than that offered in the company’s HQ or don’t get granted equity at all – we’re here to fix that. We offer remote contributors better transparency by showing the value of their stake in the company, and we increase liquidity by making it possible to sell back their tokens to the company, and soon to other contributors.” Salto X is building a mechanism that gives transparent access to equity compensation to contributors regardless of geography. The process is streamlined via blockchain technology and contributors receive NFT certificates for the cliff period. The smart contract automatically and continuously executes token transfers upon vesting. These tokens can be cashed out in case of full or partial exit, or sold to other parties after vesting. This creates much-needed liquidity without the company needing to exit with an IPO or a sale. Currently, the company employs 15 people and is looking to double down on hiring in 2022. Investor Sara Rywe said: “Talent today demands a sense of ownership and companies want to incentivize top talent to stay, which is why we’ve seen a rise of widely used employee option programs. However, with companies going global and setting up remote work practices, it’s proven too complex and costly for many to implement a regular ESOP. We’re therefore very excited about backing SaltoX – led by the uniquely capable founders Elise, Tanya, Krists, and Ragnar – on their mission to simplify and transform employee incentives.”"
2022.7.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/swedens-ark-kapital-doubles-capital-pool-to-e300-million-with-a-fresh-e150-million-boost/,"Data-driven precision finance company ArK Kapital has made a very exciting announcement today – its capital pool has been extended to €300 million. The firm is committed to enabling European startups to grow faster and smarter, and this is a big boost to the firm and the wider startup ecosystem. Just a couple of months since its raise of €165 million – earmarked to support Europe’s early-stage tech-driven startups – ArK Kapital has doubled its capital pool to €300 million. It’s now one of the biggest lending pools available to European tech founders. The loan facility comes from a Swedish bank. They say that amid uncertainty, there is always a glimmer of light shining toward good things to come. In recent months, with looming doom and gloom surrounding a possible economic collapse, there’s been a fair share of uncertainty in the investment and startup space. However, at the same time, there are positive signs of the resilience Europe has cultivated and money is still circulating. Launched in 2021, ArK Kapital fuses banking and artificial intelligence, operating as a data-driven precision finance company that enables technology companies to grow faster and smarter through long-term loans – maintaining control for founders and reducing risk for investors. The Stockholm-based firm has optimised the process through its proprietary AI platform: the ArK Intelligence Machine (AIM). The AIM connects to the raw business data of a company and combines insights with relevant external market data. The result is that hidden possibilities for growth are unlocked and strategic foresight is uncovered. Potential insights include when a customer will become profitable, when they will require new capital injection, and how quickly they can reasonably repay a loan. Based on that intelligence, ArK customises loans and other financial tools that fuel growth for founders with fewer mistakes and less equity dilution. Oliver Hildebrandt, CEO and co-founder, said: “AIM, and our AI-driven, always-connected approach to underwriting seems to be exactly what the financial markets have been waiting for, which makes it possible for us to onboard more and more financial partners to the AIM-platform, unlocking more growth-money for the European founder community.” Now, with this new raise, the Swedish fintech innovators can provide an incredible total of €300 million to investment-worthy founders through non-dilutive loans of €1-10 million. It’s undoubtedly an important step in the company’s wider mission to become a leader in growth financing and intelligence. ArK stands apart from first-generation revenue-based financing (RBF) products, which normally oblige companies to begin repayments instantly and pay back the full amount in a short timescale. However, with ArK, founders have more legroom and breathing space – fitting the reality of many tech companies’ growth journeys. The ArK Growth Loan lasts up to seven years, with repayments not starting for two-to-three years– letting founders build without having to start repaying with borrowed money. The second loan product in the portfolio allows founders to get instant access to the money they’ve earned through various marketplaces, letting them reinvest into growth peaks. Henrik Landgren, CPTO and co-founder, explained: “We find ourselves right in the eye of the current storm. We are honestly the only ones that offer a real option to equity funding, with big loans stretching over several years. That is why more money is being put into our pocket this early on, as the demand is so high. Getting funding from us should however not be seen as a rescue package, but a sign of strength. We take a DNA-test of companies’ growth; if they get a loan, it means that they are showing the type of growth the whole capital market is scouting for.”"
2022.7.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/meet-carbmee-the-berlin-based-startup-helping-companies-decarbonise/,"Based in Berlin, Carbmee is a startup joining the growing market of carbon management. As carbon reduction becomes a key priority for both the private and public sectors, software tools such as Carbmee’s are becoming pivotal in the path to Net-Zero. In 2021, Dr. Christian Heinrich, together with co-founders Hendrik Beneke and Robin Spickers, embarked on a mission to help companies reduce their carbon footprint. They launched Carbmee with a belief in the power of collaboration to impact change. The greentech startup offers a pioneering Environmental Intelligence System that enables companies to reduce their carbon footprint by analyzing supply chains – and it’s picking up steam. Collaboration between enterprises and startups allows big, slower-moving teams to integrate and embed innovative and dynamic solutions. In the fight against climate change, it’s an approach that is reaping big rewards and it’s exciting to see how startups can contribute to achieving net-zero and ambitious climate targets. We chatted to Christian Heinrich to find out more about Carbmee, exploring how digitization is helping us reach carbon neutrality, how collaborations can provide a boost to these goals and more. Can you tell us about Carbmee’s backstory? How did you launch the company? Prior to Carbmee, I was co-founder of Scoutbee – one of the most successful procurement start-ups – where I was responsible for the Market & Growth division. My co-founder, Robin is a trained mechanical engineer with several years of experience, specializing in procurement, supply chain, data management, and digitalization, and worked at Siemens shortly before Carbmee. And finally, Hendrik is a software engineer and developer, who has also co-founded before and worked at companies like SAP and Walmart in the past. When Robin and I first met and started talking about this topic, Robin had to explain scope 1, 2, and 3 to me. And I thought, my goodness! Scope 3 emissions is such a huge problem and nobody is focusing on solving it. In many cases, scope 3 is responsible for over 80% of the total emissions within one company. We immediately reached within our networks to our first potential customers and started deep-diving with them into the challenges they were facing. We were able to gain tremendous insights already then. At that point, we came together with Hendrik, our Technical Lead, and started developing our product. What are the main services that Carbmee offers? The most key service we offer to our customers is at the core of our EIS Carbon Management Solution – it’s the ability to not only ensure carbon transparency over the most complex parts of their value chain, but the ability to allocate emissions within their supply chain while also working collaboratively either within their company, or externally with suppliers to reduce them. We break down what our Solution offers into four parts which are to Measure, Decide, Take Action, and Report. To accomplish the latter two parts, the former, which are Measure and Decide, are absolutely essential to complete first and this is done with our EIS™ Carbon Footprint Automation and EIS™ Analytics. What are the main segments where Carbmee has clients today? It’s important to us that we focus on industries with some of the largest carbon footprints and most extensive value chains globally. This means we work mostly with industry leaders in logistics, automotive, manufacturing, chemicals, and FMCG. How do you see the future of ESG adoption in Europe? And of decarbonization? I see the future of both as inextricably linked and also part of a larger, more pressing shift. Right now the climate crisis is only growing direr, and the subsequent pressures coming from the market, customers, investors, and regulators – this is all driving the adoption of ESG and corporate decarbonization strategies in general. Companies need to incorporate these into their overall strategies to operate in a way that we call “carbon-aware”, which means that they take carbon into consideration throughout every step of their daily operations, to be conscious of the carbon perspective for every important decision. All that to say, I think ESG adoption and decarbonization will continue to become a higher priority for companies not only in Europe, but companies globally. What does onboarding customers like Kärcher, KWS Saat, Infineon and Infarm, mean for your ongoing strategy? It’s been quite exciting to work with and speak publicly about these large German companies – they’re big names with influence and working with them has helped us to attract international companies that we are currently onboarding. I think it’s helped us to continue developing the company with more confidence, as we’ve been generating revenue almost since the beginning. With the way VC funding is leaning now, it’s clearly important that companies are able to show the results and customers they’ve been able to not only secure but deliver to, so I think Carbmee is in a great position right now. Are there any plans for expansion? How much of your business revenue is coming from regions outside Europe? We definitely have plans to expand outside of the German market, since we’ve seen huge interest in our solution on an international level. As I said, being able to speak about our experiences thus far with the German companies we’ve already been working with has helped to build trust and confidence with existing and new customers in the UK and North American markets. There’s also growing interest in Asia, but one step at a time, as they say. What do you think could ease the adoption of real Net Zero corporate strategies in the EU? I think a huge help in this would be clearer guidance and support from the government. It’s understandable that they want to get emissions under control for the good of society and the planet, and that industries across all sectors need to do their part – no one is arguing with that. However, the reality is that these industries and activities drive economies and livelihoods. It’s crucial that we find a way for companies to comply with net-zero requirements, while still remaining profitable. To achieve this, the government needs to do more than set ambitious goals; it needs to also provide companies with the clarity and direction they need to ensure they can not only comply, but also thrive. An example of this would be to work together with organizations like SBTi or GRI to work backwards from targets, translating the goal into possible actions needed to get there. This is in addition to grants and funds that go into projects, programs, and solutions that all contribute to the achievement of net-zero emissions. If companies see a clear and doable path to net-zero, that is supported by the tools they need, then they’re more confident in tackling the challenge of decarbonizing their value chains. What do you look for when hiring a new team member? I really look for the right combination of experience and ambition. Unlike some start-ups, our team does lean a bit senior with considerable years of industry experience. We do have incredibly ambitious junior team members, but part of the reason we’ve been able to hit the ground running since the start is that we really look for team members with a fair bit of experience, even if it’s not in one exact field or another. Often skills can translate from one industry to another, but having learned from past successes and mistakes takes time – and I really value that. Looking back at your experience, what would you do differently today? To be honest, I think we would listen even more to our gut instinct and then push even harder to empower companies to own and communicate the decarbonization journeys that they’re on. It’s daunting for many of them to be as transparent as possible when they’re not positive if they’re doing everything right on their own. With tools like Carbmee’s the journey is outlined and they can be confident in their strategies. So we’ve now been emphasizing this, but I think we could have started even earlier with that."
2022.7.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/berlin-based-myne-scores-e23-5-million-to-shake-up-the-holiday-home-market-with-its-co-ownership-platform/,"Proptech startup MYNE Homes has just raised €23.5 million for its fresh approach to holiday home ownership. The Berlin-based platform is bringing a fresh approach to co-ownership and growing fast. Across Europe the real estate market is soaring – rising market prices and increasing rentability are making investments in holiday properties more and more attractive. This, combined with a new lifestyle approach regarding work-life balance, that is seeing more people take ‘workcations,’ has meant that Europeans are investing more into the sector. Berlin-based startup MYNE, founded in 2021, has just picked up a seed funding round of €23.5 million with its platform that is enabling people to invest in shared holiday property. The funding round saw contributions from Ramin Niroumand’s FinTech Fund, embedded/capital, HomeToGo founder Nils Regge’s family office, TruVenturo, Scope Hanson, Rivus Capital, CoastCap, and, from Finanzcheck founder Moritz Thiele. They join existing investors including renowned business angels such as Hakan Koç (Auto1) and Christian Gaiser (numa stays). MYNE Co-Founders Nikolaus Thomale and Fabian Löhmer said: “There is a growing interest in jointly owned holiday properties for owner-occupation and rental. Our digital all-in-one offer has been very positively received by the market. With this investment, we will further expand the digital platform for existing and future co-owners, open up new properties in attractive locations, and further expand our European market leadership.” Via the proptech platform, customers can acquire shares in high-quality properties in popular holiday destinations. Minimum investments begin at €50k making it an accessible investment opportunity – and given the lucrative and low-risk nature of property investment, it’s an attractive prospect. With a smart scheduling system, co-owners can rest assured that they can use their property according to their personal preferences. The MYNE team take care of the furnishing, maintenance and professional management of the property, making investments relatively hassle-free. Further, the startup also has the capacity to take over renting of the properties when they’re not being used by the co-owners if needed. It also helps with marketing and sales processes should customers eventually want to sell their shares. Whilst the prospect of owning a holiday home has always been attractive, for many it’s remained a pipe dream rather than a reality. Buying a maintaining a property abroad is a complex and costly process – from finding and inspecting the property to the complex linguistic, tax and legal hurdles to jump through. And that’s before considering the financial and management aspects of the purchase. MYNE Homes, however, is changing the game. Making the dream of holiday home ownership a reality through its co-ownership model. Victor Schlenkhoff, Managing Director at Scope Hanson, said: “MYNE has created a disruptive and very successful business model that enables more people to own real estate – we want to be part of this development.” Currently, interested buyers can choose from a varied portfolio of quality properties in sought-after destinations including the Alps, Mallorca and Portugal – so whether you’re more a fan of mountain hiking or beach-lazing, it has you covered. The startup is also planning to expand to add properties in Italy and France soon. Currently available to German, Austrian and Swiss customers, this new funding will be used to open up the platform to users across Europe and enter new markets. Michael Hock, General Partner at embedded/capital commented: “In an exceedingly fragmented market with diverse stakeholders, technology is critical to successful cross-border property investment. This is where MYNE Homes is building a unique platform, which we are proud to back as part of this round.”"

2022.7.11,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/5-important-lessons-the-public-sector-can-learn-from-unicorns-sponsored/,"Unicorn startups – those fast-growing companies that hit a value of over one billion dollars – are often looked at for inspiration by innovators and business leaders. But what can the public sector learn from unicorns? Unicorn startups have something in common – they’ve all mastered the art of using technology to solve common challenges and then scale innovations globally. Startup founders are often looked upon as an example of strategic thinkers, able to notice the market inefficiencies and create out-of-the-box solutions to solve them. Move fast and break things One sector that has historically been full of inefficient processes, legacy systems and old-school technology is the public sector, specifically governments. Although Silicon Valley’s famous motto ofmove fast and break things might not be the most appropriate for the government, the startup world still has many valuable learnings to share. Recently, the GovTech Baltic Leaders conference in Vilnius hosted conversations with representatives from two unicorn startups – Povilas Poderskis, COO at Nord Security, former CEO of Vilnius City Municipality Administration, and Martin Ott, CEO of Taxfix. Both conversations were moderated by Greta Monstavice, the Co-founder and CEO of Katalista Ventures. During the discussion, the two founders were able to share thoughts about what governments and the public sector can learn from startups like them – and why they should listen up. #1 Citizen – at the centre of the service Startups build products around their users, not based on their internal processes. The user-centricity, simplicity and intuitiveness are often their competitive advantages over legacy market players. on the flip side, digital public services tend to be more aligned with old corporates rather than dynamic startups. Taking a page from the startup book to put citizens first, governments can begin exchanging complex bureaucratic messages to simple language, differentiating and personalising experiences for different people (e.g., different processes for a student or a senior) and ensuring that various forms are pre-filled as much as possible #2 Culture of iteration and testing Startups are often the best examples of agility. With continuous testing, feedback, and iteration they are able to build products that truly suit global needs. They can quickly find what works, pivot toward better solutions and ditch unsuitable features or products. Of course, governments and businesses are inherently different in this space – if a public service does not seem to attract much interest, the government cannot just decide to pivot to another service as they are often bound by law to provide it anyway. But it doesn’t mean they can’t be agile. Additionally, the space for iteration should be chosen carefully – iterations and testing should be done with limited disruption to live systems. Having continuous feedback loops, and analysing drop-off points during the service should become part of the day-to-day agenda for the digital public service employees. #3 More cross-functionality Unicorn startups are often nimble enough to build cross-functional teams by design. This ensures that challenges across the organisation are shared while skills, perspectives and knowledge are not siloed among the departments. Breaking down these siloes is one of the key takeaways for the public sector. For the more pressing challenges of our time, such as climate or demographic change, the same cross-functional abilities are essential to finding out-of-the-box solutions. #4 Take care of your talent Talent is at the core of creating the best products and services. Whilst we are in the midst of a global talent shortage and increased competition for digital skills, unicorn startups have adapted and taken action. They are offering higher salaries, creative working environments and providing other perks to attract and retain talent. The appreciation and importance of talent must be taken on by the public sector organisation as well. Although often unable to offer similarly high salaries, public sector organisations could focus more on selling the impact and purpose of the public service. This way attracting the attention of younger generations – who are increasingly putting social purpose to the top of the agenda. #5 Create pathways for collaborations Major tech platforms and social networks have built APIs or other tools to ensure that external developers can connect to their systems, create, and integrate new tools. This can help the platforms themselves grow and evolve as they become part of a bigger network. The public service can definitely learn a thing or two here. Digital platforms and organisations should be creating standardised APIs together with easily accessible documentation. This could help startups build exciting new tools on already existing digital services, without putting this burden solely on the public sector. Key takeaways Startups and governments are different – but that doesn’t mean they cna’t look to each other for inspiration and advice.The public sector can learn various methods and techniques from startups and apply them to solving major challenges of our time.

2022.7.11,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/barcelona-based-impress-has-just-scored-over-e123-million-for-its-tech-driven-orthodontic-solution/,"European orthodontic leader, Impress, has just scored over €123 million for its tech-driven approach to the sector. The Barcelona-based startup is now on track to expand globally and digitize the orthodontic experience. Making orthodontic treatment digital was a unique idea back in 2019 when Impress was founded by renowned orthodontist Dr. Khaled Kasem and serial entrepreneurs Diliara and Vladimir Lupenko. Until then, dentistry and orthodontic treatment were seen as something done manually and in the clinic. Based in Barcelona, Impress combines the best of orthodontic tradition with the most innovative technology in the sector – creating a hybrid tech-driven orthodontic clinic. The startup has just raised over €123 million in fresh funding, consolidating its position as a market leader in the sector – just 3 years after its launch. The Series B funding has had the support of LBO France, Norgine Ventures, and Claret Capital Partners. Existing investors TA Ventures, Uniqa Ventures and Nickleby Capital also participated in the round. For the disruptive company, technology is one of the main pillars of success. The digital orthodontic brand has a growing network of hybrid clinics that is leveraged by a top-tier clinical team and vertically integrated tech stack (including AI-driven Management Practice Software, patented treatment planning software, and best-in-class AI-driven treatment monitoring App). Recently Impress also put into operation one of the largest European R&D and clear aligner production facilities. While DTC models keep losing credibility, Impress has bet on the hybrid model having tech-enabled orthodontic clinics since the very beginning. This has led to industry-leading sales conversion rates, an exceptional customer experience (NPS 84), and best-in-class clinical outcomes, all driven by a tech stack that is getting harder to replicate by the day. Diliara Lupenko, Co-founder and COO of Impress, explained: “We created an absolutely new orthodontic experience powered by tech. All of the processes are fully digitalized thanks to Impress own product and software. This accomplishment would not have been possible without close contact between our patients and medical team, because this is the only way we can understand their needs and expectations.” The Barcelonian startup has also developed a mobile app to further enhance customer experience whilst undergoing teeth alignment treatment. Through the app, patients and doctors can connect around the clock, remote scans can be made, appointments can be booked and referrals can be made. Impress also has a new paid subscription model to provide current and non-Impress customers with post-treatment oral care services such as medical procedures, checkups, and consultations from the team of orthodontics experts. Already the company has more than 130 clinics across 8 different countries, including Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and the UK, creating a unique and scalable business model with a strong base of proven success. Further, the team has been growing fast from its headquarters in Barcelona to now having a global headcount of 1000 employees. Impress also reports that 80% of the clinics are already profitable – an impressive feat in just three years of operation. Valéry Huot, Partner Head of Venture at LBO France, said: “Impress is disrupting the orthodontics market while maintaining medical excellence and patient care at highest level. We are thrilled to join Impress shareholder base and contribute to its fantastic scale-up.” Going forward, this funding will provide a boost to further European expansion, increased investment in tech, and, extending the in-house production facility. The scaleup is certainly soaring and it represents another Barcelona-based success story. Peter Stein, executive chairman at Norgine Ventures, added: “We are very excited by our investment in Impress. The clear aligner market represents an attractive growth opportunity. With this investment, we support a company that, since its inception in 2019, has achieved significant growth and geographical expansion, with a differentiated offering focusing on quality of care, patient journey and operational efficiency, and is well positioned to further grow and capture a significant share of the market.”"
2022.7.11,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/new-deeptech-fund-for-europes-startups-as-elaia-alpha-ii-closes-at-e77-million/,"Today, investment firm Elaia has announced the close of a new fund at €77 million for Europe’s up-and-coming deeptech startups. Working in partnership with Inria, the fund is well over its initial target of €65 million, demonstrating that Europe’s investment landscape is alive and well. Based in Paris, Elaia has been championing investment in startups across Europe since 2002 and is certainly one of the continent’s most well-known names. The company has just reaffirmed its commitment to investing in Europe – closing its second deeptech dedicated fund at €77 million. Elaia Alpha II Fund is to become a key part of the firm’s proactive strategy to promote technological entrepreneurship. Leaidign ivnestors taking part in this exciitg new capital pool include VINCI Concessions, Inria, Bpifrance for the Fonds National d’Amorçage 2 (FNA 2), Covéa Finance, BNP Paribas, L’Oréal and Malakoff Humanis. Inria is a key partner in this fund as the relationship between Inria and Elaia has continued to grow over time. In early 2019, Inria announced the launch of Inria startup studio, in partnership with Bpifrance, to support, from 2023 on, over 100 startup projects per year. Dedicated to the deep tech space, the money will be deployed in pre-seed and seed stages in 30-40 European startups in various sectors – including AI, data science, digital health, cybersecurity, digital infrastructures, enterprise software, industrial IoT and embedded systems. Already 14 investments have been made – highlighting just how proactive the team aim to be. Anne-Sophie Carrese, partner at Elaia, commented: “We are delighted with this new deep tech seed fund at Elaia, which together with PSL Innovation Fund, give us a firepower of €153M to invest in technological startups close to research. We now have 33 startups in the deep tech seed portfolio, and see success reaching go to market, refinancing and international development.” The firm has supported startups like Criteo, SeqOne, Armis and Elevo – so this new cohort of startups will be in great company. All investments made by Elaia are also considered around ESG principles. There’s no doubt that seeing big tech funds like this open up is a great sign for early-stage startups and it’s a positive sign to see in the innovation space. However, what European startups really need is long-term support and confidence that investments won’t dry up. It’ll be interesting to see how this fund, like others that have been recently closed, will develop and scale selected startups. Elaia has also made two new strategic changes in the company – appointing Anne Bouverot as a board member and Sébastien Lefebvre as a partner. Anne is to become the firm’s newest and first independent board member. Having previous experience in corporate governance and leadership in her 25+ year career in telecoms, information technology and media. Anne Bouverot, stated: “ I am very proud to join the Board of Elaia, the leading European VC backing deep tech startups. I am convinced that paving the way to a sustainable and inclusive digital transition implies to think and act concretely at European scale. Accelerating the pioneering Tech startups in AI, data science, cybersecurity, or digital health, driven by a common taste of innovation, is a way to decoding tomorrow and a path to soft power- promoting European values and vision of society, concern for social impact and an ethical sensibility.” Newly appointed partner, Sébastien Lefebvre, has previosuly been invovled with Elaia as Venture Partner. He has had an interesting career indeed, including time spent as the Director of Growth, EMEA at Twitter. Now based in Barcelona, he is committed to supporting deep tech startups across Europe. He stated: “I’m delighted to join Elaia as a Partner. In addition to having an exceptional track record, the team is challenging, inspiring and extremely supportive to entrepreneurs. I look forward to contributing to the success of Elaia, our LPs and our portfolio companies, in France and internationally.”"
2022.7.11,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/making-impact-and-big-returns-insights-from-tim-he-partner-at-summa-equity/,"“Instead of taking existing business ideas and trying to extract sustainability from it, focus on reframing the business model on areas where you can have the greatest material impact, both commercially and in relation to society and the environment.” Can solving global challenges and making great returns in the process, go hand in hand? What about sustainability and technology? Summa Equity, a thematic investment firm that invests in companies that address some of our global challenges, says yes to these questions. Founded in 2016 and based out of Stockholm, Summa Equity invests in companies that have leading solutions to global challenges and that create positive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes for society, while also making superior returns. We caught up with Tim He, Partner at Summa Equity, and he shared with us his and Summa Equity’s views and experiences in building sustainability as an operating model and driver of value, moving beyond impact and sustainability as a compliance, risk management or marketing objective. He also talked about Summa Equity’s Private Equity 4.0 and how it is driving their investment mandate. Can you tell us about your investor journey? How did you come to work at Summa Equity? After a few short stints in banking, I moved into the world of startups as a founding member of Groupon in China. After that stint, I wanted to start my own business, but without an idea that stuck, I started supporting founders as an investor. First with Stockholm-based Northzone, and later Kinnevik. I joined Summa Equity (“Summa”) last November, to build out our growth investment strategy, focusing on companies in the growth scale-up phase (Series B+). I was drawn to Summa’s clear focus on investing to solve global challenges, and we share the belief that technology can play a huge part in this mission, while also making superior returns. My role includes all aspects of developing new investment ideas, assessing, and executing new investments, but more importantly, working with our founders and CEOs to support them in value creation and building their companies for the next stage of their journey. What sets Summa Equity apart from other VC’s? Summa started in 2016 and has since raised three funds, the latest being a dedicated Article 9 impact fund with a strong commercial foundation. We find this really resonates with founders. In the past, they have usually faced the choice of either a non-impact fund, which might put on a sustainability ‘hat’ for certain investments, or a more traditional impact fund, which tended to be a different type of investor. We give equal weight to both elements, while always utilising our expertise, experience and networks to help our portfolio companies high-grade themselves to make even more impact. Within our focus of solving global challenges, we apply a thematic approach, with three core themes that span both our buyout and growth investment strategies. These are Resource Efficiency, Changing Demographics (precision medicine), and Tech-Enabled Transformation. Some examples of sector expertise within those are Sustainable Food, Energy Transition, Waste and Recycling, Aquaculture, and Industry 4.0 (i.e. the automation and digitisation of industry). How can startups consider sustainability and ESG in their operations? Thinking about impact is important and valuable for any startup, whatever the product or service, and we believe it is the key to driving value, performance and resilience in an increasingly uncertain world. But instead of taking their existing business idea and trying to extract sustainability from it, startups should focus on reframing their business model to focus on the areas where they can have the greatest material impact, both commercially and in relation to society and the environment. Ask yourself, what needs to be in place for your company to last 100 years? That means taking care of your customers, employees and the society you operate in. mpact and sustainability are often seen through the lenses of compliance, risk management and marketing. How can companies – including startups and investors, and society by extension – move beyond this thinking and build sustainability as an operating model and a driver of value? Companies need to look at the core areas where they have the largest opportunity to make an impact, rather than falling back on default ESG measures. One way to do this is to look at the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are the 17 biggest global challenges we currently face as a planet. The SDGs are a great place to start to discover how your business can solve the biggest problems, and drive value at the same time. Impact targets should be material, linked to the core purpose of the business, and correlate and be co-linear with financial targets. They should thread through every aspect of the business, rather than being seen as a separate project or department. All leaders should be held accountable for reaching sustainability goals, and incentive structures should also reflect these priorities, in the same way as financial goals. What is Private Equity 4.0 and how is it driving Summa Equity’s investment mandate? Private equity has been through a variety of incarnations over the years, where investors have harnessed different strategies to create superior risk-adjusted returns. In the 80s, Private Equity 1.0 created value through financial engineering, moving to Private Equity 2.0 and operational improvements in the 90s. Then Private Equity 3.0 in the 2000s, saw firms become institutionalized and start to add value, expanding into different asset classes and new areas of expertise. In recent years, we have seen externalities – that is the positive and negative impacts created by a business – start to matter more. Firms are realising that companies that create a negative impact, or which are at higher risk of being impacted, will see their profitability and market values fall accordingly – and vice versa with those that are positively correlated with externalities. Consequently, the future lies in transitioning to Private Equity 4.0, where value is created through having a positive influence, environmentally or socially, while reducing risk through management of impact factors. Do you think that startups – perhaps owing to their agile nature, ability to pivot and scale, etc. – are in a unique position to make a genuine impact? Summa has historically focused on the buyout space, however, we have expanded into growth investments because we believe this is where a lot of the exciting developments are happening, and growth companies have a unique opportunity to make an impact. Firstly, we believe that a lot of impact can be made through the application of technology, and the growth equity stages are home to some of the biggest opportunities in technology companies. Furthermore, growth companies are able to approach things in a different way to more established businesses, through being smaller, nimbler, and faster growing, which means they can deliver significant impact over time, while often forcing incumbents to rethink and change, thereby creating much more impact. The classic example is Tesla – Tesla doesn’t produce many cars in comparison with incumbents, but it has forced all existing car manufacturers to rethink and transition to EVs much earlier than otherwise, extending significant impact as an industry. Beyond funding ESG-focused start-ups and ventures, what else or more do VC’s (investors in general) need to do to move/change the landscape of impact-driven innovation? There is a tendency to overemphasise E in ESG for investors, especially in earlier investment rounds. E is arguably easier to measure and communicate, however, we need to recognise that E, S and G are correlated, and that we can’t fix one without addressing the others. By having a more 360-degree view, more positive impact startups can be funded. Funding volume typically drives more entrepreneurs to start businesses. By having a broader view on impact and by funding more businesses that are ESG positive, VCs will inspire and attract more entrepreneurs to build companies that are net positive. It’s not what the investors can do themselves, but rather, what we can do to build momentum for the next generation of companies being built. If they are predominantly ESG positive, that’s a great win for us all."
2022.7.11,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/berlin-based-kadmos-lands-e29-million-to-streamline-payments-for-migrant-workers/,"Fintech startup Kadmos has just secured €29 million for its innovative platform streamlining payment processes for migrant workers. Based in Berlin, Kadmos’ platform means employers can cut expenses and admin work whilst workers have an improved salary experience. It’s reported that there are over 169 million migrant workers across the world. People who love their hometowns for jobs in industries such as seafaring, construction and agriculture to provide a better life for their families. However, these workers have, on a whole, faced issues with payment processes and high remittance costs. On a mission to change this, Kadmos has just secured €29 million in Series A funding. The capital was led by Blossom with participation from existing investors Addition and Atlantic Labs. Founded in 2021 by Justus Schmueser and Sasha Makarovych, the startup was born with the vision to tackle the restrictions placed on the financial freedom of cross-border employees. Using modern financial technology, the product allows migrant workers to have a streamlined salary experience, just as they would expect working in their home country. Migrant workers have so far received little attention from the recent fintech boom and Kadmos’ mission is to bring the latest financial technology to these underserved communities of workers. Justus Schmueser, Kadmos co-founder explained: “The financial restrictions placed on migrant workers are truly shocking. Employees need to wait days or weeks for their hard-earned salaries to reach their families and are then forced into paying exorbitant transaction fees or have to carry large sums of cash at their own risk. At Kadmos, we are working to change the status quo through cutting-edge financial technology and ensuring the hard-working people who power the global economy can keep more of their well-deserved salaries The traditional financial system presents employers with unnecessary complexity when paying salaries across the globe, and often requires employers to pay large fees to simply transfer salary payments. For example, the shipping industry is still dominated by expensive, slow, and untransparent payment processes. Many shipping companies resort to bringing significant amounts of cash on board to pay their employees, which is both costly and insecure. Additionally, seafarers face unfavourable exchange rates and high fees to send money home to their families and often wait days or even weeks to get access to their salaries. Enter Kadmos The German startup has developed seamless and easy-to-use web and mobile apps which provide a secure salary payments platform for shipping companies, enabling them to efficiently pay their crews. Kadmos provides seamless integration with the Kadmos web application, where companies can automatically add their employees through an API-connection to various crewing software. For employees, the app is easy to access and salaries are instantly paid. It means workers can then choose to transfer money home or to use a debit card or withdraw cash – they have the power back over their hard-earned money. Sasha Makarovych, Kadmos co-founder said: “At Kadmos, our mission is simple, to make being paid internationally as easy as being paid domestically. In an ever-globalized world, it’s criminal that it is so difficult for cross-border employers and their employees to pay and be paid. We’ve been taken aback by the level of demand for our product, particularly as geopolitical crises continue to cause issues around cross-border payments. To have Blossom’s support will mean that we can continue to rapidly expand our team and the product.” Digitalizing the payment process means the funds can be kept in secure currencies within the Kadmos app, ensuring low transaction fees and market-leading foreign exchange rates. This ensures workers keep more of their salary when they send money home. These benefits have a knock-on effect for employers as they can better attract and retain employees by using an efficient payment process like Kadmos. Kadmos is already working with several high-profile shipping companies and has built a robust waitlist ahead of full-scale customer onboarding this summer. This fresh investment boost will be used to grow the team further and develop its technology and product – including the prospect of offering additional financial services to its users. Kadmos will also expand into other industries with similar salary payment complexities such as construction, healthcare, and hospitality. Through this, Kadmos is on a mission to transform the way millions of people across the globe, who are underbanked and underserved, access financial services. Alex Lim, Managing Partner of Blossom Capital added: “From the moment we met Justus and Sasha we couldn’t help but be drawn to their scale of ambition and drive. With outdated banking practices and multiple intermediaries that charge excessive fees, it’s clear that the process for cross-border payments is broken and Kadmos’ fintech platform is exactly the technology to fix it. 2022 looks set to be an exciting year for the team as they look to grow the product into new verticals and we’re delighted to be joining them on this journey.”"

The Barcelona-based startup has developed a platform that optimises and streamlines inventory and sales management across all channels – giving a boost to SMEs’ business processes. With a booming ecommerce market, small and medium businesses have found themselves needing to digitalise their processes and centralise all their online, in-store and marketplace sales in one place. Doing so gives SME business leaders and owners clearer oversight and better management processes. On a mission to facilitate this, Barcelona-based Stockagile has just scored €2.5 million in a round led by the Pan-European venture capital firm, Nauta Capital, 4Founders Capital, Angels, Juan Roig’s investment firm part of Marina de Empresas, and Zone2Boost. Founded in 2017, Stockagile offers a cloud-based platform that enables inventory and sales management across all sales channels – bricks and mortar, online and marketplaces. It means all data and information can be centralised in one place – a massive organisational boost for SMEs who are increasingly expected to be omnichannel by nature. Miquel Subirats, co-founder and CEO of Stockagile, explained: “The future of retail lies in agile ways of working, optimisation and automation. SMEs need to sell as much as possible with limited resources in order to survive; they can only achieve this through digitalisation. Stockagile digitalises processes and connects the different sales channels using the latest technology to help retailers earn more. We aim to reach a point where many of the retail processes are automated – from deciding price points to placing orders with suppliers.” The company was founded by two brothers, Miquel and Joan Subirats. Engineers by profession, they quickly identified the lack of digitalisation within SMEs in the retail sector. Their product supports retailers in their end-to-end supply chain by synchronising catalogues, stock availability and orders in real-time. Jordi Viñas, Barcelona-based Nauta Capital Partner, added: “According to market research, it is expected that by 2040 in-store and online sales volumes will be similar, nowadays the split is closer to 20/80 respectively. Companies, such as Stockagile, that connect the offline and online worlds within the retail industry have experienced a boom following the pandemic and we believe this trend will continue, making them a vital part of retail’s future.” Stockagile customers include small and medium businesses that sell physical products: brands, wholesalers, businesses, retail chains, ecommerce stores or digital brands that need to digitalise their processes or need to centralise their online, in-store and marketplace sales – and they’ve been picking up steam. In 2021, Stockagile was selected to be part of Lanzadera, Juan Roig’s start-up incubator and also part of Marina de Empresas. Now, looking to the future, the startup wants to enhance the platform offering and increase customer sales. It will also use the new funding to launch a fresh sales and marketing strategy. Marc Castilblanco, Principal at 4Founders Capital, also commented: “The rapid growth rate that retail technology that helps digitalize and improve inventory management has had. After a year as investors, we pushed another round of funding given the high potential of the project and because we believe that Miquel and Joan can make Stockagile the go-to-solution in inventory management for the retail industry.”"

Cathay Innovation Fund III has just become one of Europe’s largest funds and is dedicated to those startups pushing forward the sustainable transformation of industry and society. Sustainability and digital transformation are two defining catalysts behind innovation at the moment. Startups across Europe have been a driving force in embedding sustainability in business practices, encouraging sustainability transparency and fuelling the digital transformation that now defines the era. Aiming to support the next decade of tech development, Cathay Innovation has just launched one of Europe’s largest VC funds – Cathay Innovation Fund III – at an incredible €1 billion. The multi-stage fund is backed by institutional investors and multinational corporations including Sanofi, Total Energies, Valeo, BNP Paribas Cardif, Groupe SEB, Groupe ADP (Paris Aéroport), SEB and more. Looking back at the past ten years in business and innovation and it’s clear that things are changing and moving fast. Even the past 3 years highlight this. So, it’s clear that the next 10 years will be no different – if not even more exaggerated. Over the next decade, all industries will need to grapple with change as modern digital infrastructure redefines markets by better linking products, customer needs and the wider value chain. The new fund looks to empower companies to lead the larger markets of the future by backing next-gen technologies, business models and platforms at the centre of digital and sustainable transformation. Mingpo Cai, Founder and Chairman of Cathay Capital and Cathay Innovation said: “We’re committed to helping create the economy of tomorrow while having a positive impact on society. Fund III marks an important milestone in our journey, building a multi-industry platform that connects large corporations and startups to collaborate, exchange knowledge and support the sustainable transformation of all stakeholders. We’re honored to have the trust of new and existing investors, partners and industry leaders who leverage the Cathay platform to take the lead in their respective fields and work together to drive meaningful change.” A fund for sustainable transformations Reflecting the change society and industry are undergoing, this fund aims to bring greater purpose to investments, focusing on both transformation potential and financial returns. Specially focused on series A, B and late-stage startups in the verticals of enterprise software, AI, fintech, digital health, tech-enabled consumer, new mobility, retail and digital energy, the fund is focused on supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals simultaneously. Check sizes will range from €5 million to €80 million, and the firm will invest as a lead or co-investor with reserves for follow-on rounds in key geographies including Europe, Asia and North America. The fund will leverage various elements of Cathay’s unique and tried-and-tested investment approach. This includes: A global investment platform which comprises investors with deep local expertise spanning the world’s innovation hubs to identify emerging trends while granting startups access to new markets. An extensive corporate ecosystem which is supported by globally leading multi-sector companies, acting as strategic partners that collaborate with portfolio companies to scale innovation in real-world industries and their own digital transformation. A sustainable investment framework that embeds sustainability into every step of the investment cycle to measure, track and maximize the impact of startups while helping entrepreneurs build more responsible resilient businesses. Denis Barrier, Co-founder of Cathay Innovation, added: “We believe the time is now to accelerate digital transformation over the next ten years as innovation represents the biggest opportunity to take on some of the world’s largest challenges. With Fund III, we now have tailored investment theses for healthcare, finance, consumer, energy, mobility and logistics – investing in next-gen technologies that will be pervasive in global industries to deliver better, more efficient products and solutions addressing the needs of end customers. And this new generation of companies, larger and more sustainable than ever before, have the potential to have a greater impact on industries, society and the day-to-day lives of people everywhere.” Backing digital disruption The global venture firm has been investing in startups driving the digital revolution across the world. Since 2015, Cathay Innovation has made over 120 investments across Europe, North America, Asia, Latin America and Africa that have gone on to raise around €16 billion and created 15k jobs. The firm has around €2 billion in assets under management. It has backed an impressive 19 unicorns, including the likes of Chime, Glovo, Ledger, Owkin, Momenta, Sidecar Health and ZenBusiness with exits including the public offerings of Pinduoduo (Nasdaq: PDD) and Wallbox (NYSE: WBX) and the acquisitions of Glovo by Delivery Hero, Drivy by Getaround, Alkemics by Salsify and Trifacta by Alteryx."
2022.7.12,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/10-young-founders-taking-europes-startup-scene-by-storm/,"Running a business, coming up with a knock-out innovation and leading teams to global success are all very impressive achievements. Even more so when these milestones are hit by people in their late teens and twenties. Across Europe, there are many young innovators who are already taking the startup space by storm. Bringing digital-first approaches to businesses in a range of sectors, it’s the next generation that is leading tech development for generations to come. GenZ and younger millennials are not only known for their tech proficiency, but, also for being more impact-driven, pursuing purpose and passion first in many cases. It’s meant we are now seeing a fresh wave of innovation driven by fresh perspectives and approaches, and Europe’s startup ecosystem has become a young wo/man’s game. We wanted to highlight some of Europe’s most exciting young founders of the day, taking a look at the startups they are scaling, and how they got to be in a position of such success at such a young age. So, here is our list of inspiring young European entrepreneurs we think are going to make a big difference in the future of business and tech: Josephine Philips Founder & CEO of Sojo 24-year-old Josephine is taking on the fashion industry – using tech to make it circular and more sustainable. Her startup, Sojo, has been described as the “Deliveroo for clothing repairs” and it’s growing fast. Launched in 2021, Sojo’s D2C platform connects customers to local clothing repair services, and, as the clothes are picked up and dropped off by bicycle couriers, customers can have their repairs and alterations done without even having to leave the house. The startup picked up €2.2 million earlier this year and is an innovative startup helping fuel circularity in fashion. Josephine studied at Kings College London and after time working with Depop, she set about on her own entrepreneurial journey with Sojo. The startup is growing fast and Josephine is a founder that is catching a lot of attention for her innovative approach to sustainability, circularity and tech – the startup has also just been chosen by Google’s Black Founders Fund. Sami Osman Co-Founder & CEO of Quartr Sami is the young, ambitious founder behind Quartr, a startup bridging the gap between companies and stakeholders. Sami founded Quartr in 2020 after graduating from Gothenburg University. In true GenZ style, he met his co-founders on Twitter’s financial community #FinTwit and so, the startup launched before the team had even met in person. Now, the team of over 40 has their headquarters on Slack and the company is soaring. Together the team has developed an app that gives anyone, regardless of their investment expertise and network, access to critical company information. Sami is the CEO of the fast-growing startup, and at just 25, his platform already lists more than 5k companies from 19 different markets. Ricard Guillem Founder of Cafler Ricard is just 17 years old and is already raising eyebrows and grabbing attention in Europe’s startup ecosystem. He founded Cafler when he was only 16 and has an entrepreneurial spirit running in his veins. Cafler is an on-demand service marketplace that acts as a one-stop-shop for all vehicle needs. From taking the vehicle to the garage, taking it for a clean, refuelling or bringing for an inspection test, the platform makes vehicle ownership simple and it’s already raised over €5 million. The young founder from Barcelona is taking the market by storm, having commenced operations already in 25 Spanish cities as well as Paris. Hubs of London, Berlin and Milan are next in the pipeline. Sebastian Haugeto Founder ofDealflow Travel influencer-turned-startup founder Sebastian Haugeto is a young entrepreneur making waves in the fintech space. Founded in 2021, Dealflow provides a copayment app for creators where you can send an invoice to a brand and receive payments that very same day. Sebastian was inspired when he was on his world travellers, making it as an influencer and living the Gen Z dream. He found that whilst he was living off video collaborations and content creation, it was hard to make ends meet. Why? Because so much time was spent on admin tasks and it could take weeks for the money to be credited. Through launching Dealflow, Sebastian has encountered a number of challenges, but, with staying true to the importance of team-fit and a belief in the product, the team just picked up fresh capital from 10 angel investors. Thelma Zablocki Co-Founder & COO of CardiaTec GenZ founder Thelma Zablocki is making her presence known in the healthtech space. She is the co-founder and COO of CardiaTec Biosciences, a Cambridge-based company combating cardiovascular disease using AI. A graduate of the University of Cambridge MPhil in Bioscience Enterprise, Thelma is a key part of the startup’s mission to improve life expectancy and quality of life – making a real impact in the lvies of those impacted by severe illnesses. Founded in 2021, CardiaTec recently raised about €1.3 million in Pre-Seed funding for its platform that uses AI to make sense of large-scale multi-omic cardiovascular data. It’s a fresh approach to medical discovery and exciting development in the healthtech space. Marc Assens Co-Founder & CTO of Happy Scribe Marc Assens is the co-founder and CTO behind Happy Scribe, a startup that has successfully bootstrapped its way to €4 million ARR. Marc founded the company in 2017, and earlier this year he took to the stage at the EU-Startups Summit to share his insider knowledge and expertise on bootstrapping successful companies. Happy Scribe has swiftly become the go-to platform for transcription and subtitling needs, now being used by over 1 million customers. After studying at Dublin City University, Marc, who is originally from Barcelona, hustled to launch Happy Scribe and is a founder gaining a lot of admiration and respect from Europe’s innovation space. He is also a founder out to make a difference, since 2020, he has been donating 10% of his salary to Effective Altruism via Earn To Give. Oliver Edholm Founder & CEO of Depict At age 15, Oliver dropped out of high school to work on AI research at European unicorn Klarna. Two years later, he launched his own startup – Depict. Founded in 2019, the Stockholm-based startup is a product recommendation engine for ecommerce retailers. It leverages AI to give retailers a fair chance to compete against ecommerce titans like Amazon. Across Europe, the ecommerce space is booming as SMEs across sectors and markets join the digital transformation. But a common pain-point has been felt – getting seen in the sea of ecommerce. Depict is helping address this. It’s now raised about €19.8 million and is growing fast. Oliver is still only 19 years old yet is a renowned entrepreneur throughout Europe for his visionary approaches to tech. Jessica Blackler Founder of Jecca Blac Turning heads in the cosmetics industry, Jessica Blackler is the founder behind Jecca Blac, a gender-neutral cosmetics company. She began her entrepreneurial journey as a makeup artist in Wales, where she found that there was a major gap in the market – genderless cosmetics. After gaining support from the L’Oreal accelerator program, she launched Jecca Blac and has now sold more than 1.6 million products. This year, the startup was chosen by Zalando as a partner to collaborate with for Transgender Visibility Day and now, Jessica is taking her brand to the US market. Bastian Krautwald Co-Founder and CEO of OWNN Bastian is a young entrepreneur from Germany focusing on improving the financial lives of younger generations. He launched OWNN (initially known as wajve) in 2021 when he was 24 years old as a digital financial advisor for GenZ. The app empowers informed decisions by giving financial education and advice in one place – an incredibly powerful tool for the digital-native generation that is experiencing greater financial upheaval and insecurity than previous generations, as well as finding themselves in an entirely new, digitally-influenced financial environment. The startup raised €5 million just a few months after its launch. Not only is Bastian the founder behind this innovative company, but he is also a popular thought leader in the fintech space, regularly putting the GenZ point of view in the spotlight. Charlotte Bailey Co-Founder & CBO of Rheal From Newcastle upon Tyne, Charlotte is a young founder innovating at the intersection of food tech and healthtech. She was recognised this year on Forbes 30 under 30 LIst as well as listed by The Times as a Rising Star of 2022. She came up with the idea for Rheal whilst in university, having experienced firsthand the benefits of taking a nutrition-informed approach to treating Coeliac disease. Founded in 2017, Rheal was launched with the vision to help people live a healthier and happier life through the power of superfoods. The startup’s product range helps people improve their health and deal with different health issues – from period problems to digestive upsets – with better nutrition. Since 2019, they’ve picked up more than 100k customers and are on track to hit about €7.9 million in revenue this year."
2022.7.12,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/why-the-multi-cloud-matters-for-your-startup-sponsored/,"Over the past decade, many startups have been tricked by the myth that one cloud provider can cover all of their needs. It’s something that’s left startups having to pay unanticipated fees and having sub-optimal processes. But there is another way – the multi cloud. Here, with insights from Scaleway, we look at how it can supercharge your startup. The myth that startups can grow with just one cloud provider has plagued the ecosystem for a while now. It came about with generous bait – providers offering the likes of 6-figure cloud credits, which promised to provide cash-strapped teams with the initial infrastructure they needed to set up their business. Whilst these credits may seem tempting, and free at first, their true nature is revealed if the startup tries to leave. Certain providers ask them to pay egress fees, often amounting to a similar value as the initial cloud credits received. It leaves startups trapped. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Such fees are no longer inevitable. Firstly, not all cloud providers charge. Secondly, 80% of cloud client needs are covered by just 20% of the products offered by most providers. Therefore, there’s potential for mobility between clouds. The coast is now clear for a better approach – the multi cloud. Introducing the multi cloud Ask a dozen people to describe the multi cloud and you’ll probably get as many answers back. For some, it’s a particular type of tech setup and for others, it’s a philosophy. It’s commonly described as:  A mix of public cloud, private cloud, and on-premise hosting (a.k.a. “hybrid cloud”) Having some data with one cloud provider and some with others Replicating the same data across several providers Or simply having the freedom to move from one provider to another without incurring substantial costs  For many, the multi cloud offers a pathway towards a more efficient architecture, making use of an otherwise unavailable compilation of products and services from various cloud providers. One principle component to the multi cloud is choice. It provides the choice to leave, move between and combine cloud services from various vendors. Today, this choice matters more than ever. Why the multi cloud is important for startups Cloud services have evolved rapidly over the past decade and so have their scale, complexity, and impact. No single vendor can meet every technical and non-technical need of clients. Further, with digital comprehension increasingly permeating public discourse, the social and environmental impacts of cloud computing are coming under increased scrutiny. The multi cloud is not just about avoiding having to pay astronomical fees to leave a cloud provider, it’s also about data sovereignty, technical flexibility, sustainability, and abandoning anti-competitive practices that have no place in a massively growing sector that has clearly expressed its preference for a multi-cloud approach. So, here we have put together 4 key reasons the multi cloud matters more to your startup than you might think.  Data sovereignty Sustainability Freedom of choice Technical flexibility  Data sovereignty Data stored in the servers of US-based tech companies can be accessed by US intelligence agencies, regardless of data storage locations (CLOUD Act, 2018). This means that data hosted by three of the world’s biggest cloud providers can be seen by the US government, even if the data center itself is on foreign soil. Doctolib – a doctor-booking platform notably tapped by the French government to schedule COVID-19 vaccinations online – found itself a subject of controversy recently, as it uses a US cloud provider, potentially making French citizens’ sensitive medical information accessible to the US government. Meanwhile, other companies such as Familink and LockSelf have switched from US to European CSPs to meet the demands of privacy-concerned clients, and to maintain the highest possible standards of data security. Accordingly, with data protectionism on the rise not only in the corridors of European institutions but also among the broader global population, having a different cloud provider depending on where your clients are can potentially unlock more business. Sustainability With the cloud’s carbon footprint eclipsing that of aviation, it’s no surprise the sector is under increased pressure to do its part in combating climate change. Fortunately, such trends as increased data center efficiency, equipment reuse, and energy-efficient products, among other things, are paving the way towards a more sustainable industry. Still, green data centers are far from ubiquitous. For startups struggling to make ends meet, technical and cost considerations take center stage, meaning sustainable hosting may be less of a priority. With the multi cloud, it’s not an either-or. Working with several cloud providers makes it possible to have at least some of your data hosted in less ecologically-impactful data centers – an initiative that will resonate not only with customers, but with talent, too. Freedom of choice Be it due to cost or technical considerations, every CTO will at some point consider switching cloud providers. Even if you can stomach the gargantuan egress fees, the technical hurdles posed by lack of compatibility are not insignificant. Especially if the core DevOps team has been trained to work with a specific cloud provider. Implementing a multi-cloud approach from day one will secure future flexibility of choice. Container and Serverless architectures are already taking the world by storm. Using them will help with any future partial or total switches between cloud providers, all while enabling broader access to an already-strained talent pool. This freedom of choice also means you can flexibly manage your infrastructure expenditure, so you don’t necessarily have to pay an arm and a leg… in particular for tech you don’t need. Technical flexibility Building a product is a discovery process – the end result is rarely what was originally envisioned, and getting there takes you through countless iterations. As your understanding of what’s required evolves, you might realize that the service that made you choose a particular cloud provider is ultimately unnecessary, or is done better by someone else. This is a potential nightmare scenario when you’ve gone all-in on the single-cloud route. Whereas with a cloud-agnostic approach, it’s a headache at worst. The technical flexibility of the multi cloud allows you to take the best out of every player, and build constrained only by your imagination, rather than by the offerings of your vendor. Key takeaway The multi cloud is on a rapid rise and looking to solidify itself as the status quo in the coming years. Currently, 76% of companies already use two or more cloud providers. So why put all your eggs in one basket, if you don’t have to? Every cloud provider has its strengths and weaknesses, but you no longer have to compromise.

2022.7.12,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/berlin-based-wefox-secures-over-e398-million-for-its-insurtech-platform-thats-redefined-the-industry/,"Consolidating itself as Europe’s leading insurtech startup, Wefox has just raised over €398 million in a Series D funding round with a valuation of over €4.48 billion. The German startup is soaring, going against recent patterns of lay-offs and growth reductions in other companies. While we are surrounded by increasing talk of an economic downturn, it feels like companies are making layoffs and scale-backs left, right and centre. The insurance world is not immune, but, we have seen a lot of big investments in Europe’s Intertech space recently. There was Yulife’s big raise last week, and now, Wefox who has just scooped up an incredible €398 million – consolidating its status as a leading European unicorn. The Series D funding round was led by Mubadala Investment Company, with participation from LGT, Horizons Ventures, and Omers Ventures. Founded in 2015, Wefox is a full-stack digital insurance company driven by a single purpose: to make people safe by reinventing insurance at scale through technology. Born in Berlin, the company has doubled its revenues every year to over €118 million in 2020 and now counts 500 employees serving over 500k customers. To date, Wefox said it has built a network of around 3k independent brokers in its native Germany, while in other markets such as Switzerland, Germany, and Austria, it has trained its own brokers. What makes Wefox unique is that it bypasses the D2C model typically adopted by insurtechs. The firm instead sells various insurance products through a combination of in-house and external brokers. This means they have been able to scale faster as it becomes easier and more cost-effective to acquire customers as they work to onboard them is essentially outsourced. It also means they can enter new markets much faster. As stated by founder and CEO, Julian Teicke: “Wefox’s ‘secret sauce’ is in its business model of indirect distribution, which has enabled the company to scale faster than any other insurtech in the world. Our model is unique in the insurtech space, since all others go direct to consumer. “We can then focus on enabling our brokers, agents, and affinity partners to target the most profitable customers, which improves our loss ratios and customer lifetime value”. It’s been an exciting year for the startup, which gained its unicorn status last year following an immense Series C raise. The company also began 2022 by becoming the official insurance sponsor for AC Milan, and, we were pleased to welcome co-founder and Group CFO Fabian Wesemann to the stage at this year’s EU-Startups Summit. Looking forward to what’s next for this exciting startup, the company has said it plans to keep growing and expanding into new European markets in 2022. Then, it wants to take on the US and Asia in 2024. Wefox also plans to add 700 employees by the end of the year."
2022.7.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/czech-startup-kontent-ai-picks-up-over-e39-million-to-bring-the-power-of-ai-to-cms/,"Brno-based Kontent.ai has just secured over €39 million for its AI-based approach to content management systems (CMS). The startup is now a standalone enterprise for the first time. In the digital era, content is one of the top priorities for marketing teams. Businesses are now icnreasingly looking to how they can diversify content and want their content management systems to be more streamlined and centralised. Not only is the increase of digital content contributing to this, but also the growth of remote and hybrid teams and that now more and more companies are reaching international clients thanks to the digital transformation. Originally started in 2015 as a business unit of bootstrapped Kentico, Kontent.ai has today become a standalone enterprise after raising over €39 million. The Brno-based startup is on a mission to bring the power of AI into content management systems and is already powering over 2000 projects, including websites, apps and headless commerce experiences. In 2021, global giants such as Algolia, Anaplan, SonarSource, the University of Oxford, Unum Insurance and Zurich Insurance made Kontent.ai their modular content platform of choice. On a global level, organisations of all sizes are turning to headless CMS as it allows them to centralise content management throughout the whole production process while enabling their developers to choose any technology stack for their digital experience. The market is growing so much that it is now projected to reach $1.6 billion by 2027. Kontent.ai’s modular content platform helps organisations unify, organise and manage all business content in a cloud-based repository. What sets Kontent.ai apart is its intuitive authoring experience that allows for simultaneous, collaborative work at every phase of the content lifecycle. By using the platform, content teams can easily plan, create, and review content with streamlined workflows and approvals. The modular content platform allows editors to focus on the content they want to produce, without being held up by structural design choices on how and where that content will be displayed. With the rise of digitalisation and new hybrid and remote work approaches, there’s never been a greater need for such a streamlined content product. Companies now, more than ever before, need to centralise their content and reproduce their digital experience at scale while their employees are working in different places and across different regionalised use cases. Increased demand for content coupled with disparate teams logically calls for more efficient processes. Using Kontent.ai’s platform, companies are able to ensure consistent content strategies across languages and regions with no need to jump in and out of other apps to collaborate and plan in real-time, saving time and money. A godsend for content teams working internationally. As explained by D’Arcy Heath, Head of Digital Marketing and Automation at Unum: “To be truly omni-channel, we needed a content platform that could support all our initiatives in one place – to be able to create once and publish everywhere. Kontent.ai gives us that flexibility and adaptability. Working with Kontent.ai has brought marketing and IT closer together too. It enables us to leverage combined skills to deliver a scalable, omni-channel SaaS solution, with the customer at its heart.” It’s also beneficial for developer teams too. The platform’s modern, microservices-based architecture allows for seamless integration with other applications and technologies. Robust APIs, webhooks, and flexible content models give developers full control over the structure of their content and how it’s delivered to their websites and applications. This ensures that clean, organised content can be pulled into any experience and technology stack, saving developers time and allowing them to focus on the best way to display information. Whilst the cloud-based content platform means that there are no concerns over maintenance with no downtime or performance issues. Alongside this funding, and the separation of Kontent.ai and Kentico, there are also some managerial changes being announced. The newly formed Kontent.ai company will be led by Bart Omlo while Kentico will be led by Dominik Pintér. The current CEO and founder of Kentico, Petr Palas will move to the role of Chairman of the Board for both companies. Oliver Thomas at Expedition Growth Capital said: “We’ve noted the impressive number of global enterprises that are choosing Kontent.ai for their headless CMS strategy and see huge potential in financing its future as an independent company. By appealing to both content creators and developers, Bart and the team are helping global companies to efficiently scale digital experience across an ever-evolving mix of channels. With AI unlocking even more powerful workflow automation for its customers, we’re excited to see the rewards of product leadership in this exciting category.” Moving forward with the capital boost, Kontent.ai wants to continue to push the boundaries of content management. It’ll enable the company to expand its global footprint in marketing and sales as well as bring the choice and governance of composable AI to its modular content platform. Kontent.ai’s CEO Bart Omlo said: “With this investment into Kontent.ai, now as its own company, we’re excited to expand our global footprint helping enterprise teams scale their content operations, make the most of machine learning and AI, and deliver exceptional digital experiences. With Kontent.ai’s modular content platform, we push the boundaries of content management to give our customers the competitive edge.” Today, Kontent.ai employs over 120 employees across five offices on four different continents. As a new independent company, it is ready to hire 100 employees in the next 12 months."
2022.7.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/berlin-based-virtual-pizza-chain-milano-vice-cooks-up-e5-9-million-to-launch/,"The first virtual pizza chain has landed in Berlin. Securing around €5,9 million, startup Milano Vice emerges from stealth mode to bring its experience-driven pizza brand to consumers. In Europe alone it’s thought that more than 50 pizzas are consumed every second. It’s not surprising really, from hanging out with friends, a family night-in, office parties and team meetings to a night out to a restaurant, pizza is one of those quintessential foods that we go back to time and time again. But now, pizza is going virtual. Berlin-based Milano Vice is targeting the changing preferences of millennials and Gen-Z consumers and has just launched out of stealth after securing about €5.9 million. The lead investor is Coefficient Capital which is joined by Speedinvest. CG Partners supported Milano Vice’s initial development and were the company’s first investor. Other angel investors are entrepreneurs and experts from the tech and hospitality industries, including Christian Gaiser (CEO and founder of NUMA Group, previously Bonial and kaufDA), Timo Meyer (Shio Capital, investor in Gorillas), Ole Strohschnieder (founder of Just Spices), David Brunier (founder of Flash Coffee), the three founders of the logistics unicorn Sennder, and the branding agency Studio Avanti. Founded earlier this year (2022), the Berlin-based startup’s virtual food franchise concept targets a new generation of pizza-eaters who prefer handmade, sustainably produced, high-quality pizzas that are conveniently delivered to their homes and offices. It uses data and tech to enable companies to identify consumer signals which can be leveraged to develop on-trend products and optimize consumer targeting. It’s essentially a tool that connects pizza producers to consumers, and gives them powerful data insights about their habits. Pizza marketing magic. Julian Blessin, Partner at Speedinvest: “Milano Vice is very capital-efficiently developing a new, disruptive virtual food franchise brand that is tailor-made to meet the demand of millennials, Gen-Y and Gen-Z. As early investors, we are very excited to support Milano Vice in its next growth phase.” It does so with high standards and pizza perfection in mind, Milano Vice selects professional kitchens and chefs as fulfilment partners. The concept is to leverage underutilized kitchens, which yields exceptional unit economics and productivity metrics. Thanks to higher margins, increased utilization of kitchen and staff, close integration into existing workflows and radically simplified processes designed for scaling, many of the pilot-phase partners were able to triple their existing sales. In fact, during the 6-month pilot, the company signed d 25 partner restaurants in Berlin, Hamburg, and Cologne. Milano Vice’s management team consists of Rudolf Donauer, responsible for marketing and product, and Dennis Murselovic, responsible for operations and sales. Both bring many years of industry experience. The team also includes former food delivery operators from JOKR, Foodora, and Delivery Hero, some with over a decade of industry experience. This new funding will be used to expand its technological lead and offering in Germany. Rudolf Donauer, Managing Director of Milano Vice, explained: “Our goal is to establish Milano Vice as the dominant provider of a new generation of virtual food franchise brands in Europe. The pandemic has proven the resilience of Milano Vice‘s business model: We have already generated meaningful revenue with only 25 restaurant partners, and some of our partners were able to triple their sales in that time thanks to our concept and proprietary technology.” Franklin Isacson, Managing Partner of Coefficient Capital added: “Milano Vice has impressed us with its strategy to grow profitably and in a capital-efficient way by using the existing supply of kitchens in bakeries and restaurants. Its initial performance and product consistency during the pilot phase demonstrated its ability to connect with their consumer and deliver a very consistent product experience. Milano Vice’s business model offers attractive profitability for franchise partners and, most importantly, a differentiated experience for the consumer.”"

2022.7.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/stockholm-based-quartr-extends-seed-round-to-e7-million-to-revolutionize-investor-communications/,"With an app that democratizes access to critical company information, Stockholm-based startup Quartr has just picked up an additional €2.5 million, taking its total seed round to about €7 million. Inflation, market turbulence and economic pessimism are just some of the terms being thrown around at the moment. It’s an investment environment that has meant accessing company information is more important than ever. It’s critical to make informed decisions in these rollercoaster times. To make it easier to access this information, and thus empower investors to make smarter calls, whilst simultaneously providing companies with investor insights, Quartr has just announced a total seed funding round of about €7 million. The fresh €2.5 million raise boosting the seed funding was led by existing investors The Öhman Group, with participation from Flat Capital (the investment firm of Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski) and Centripetal Capital, in addition to existing investors Michael Batnick, Josh Brown, and Barry Ritholtz. Based in Stockholm, Quartr was founded in 2020 by Sami Osman – an inspiring young entrepreneur we reckon has an exciting future ahead. The startup’s app is used by both investors and companies to achieve more insights and information, helping make investment decisions that are more informed and inherently better for the long run. Quartr enables publicly listed companies to distribute information globally and reach a wider audience while delivering insights and data. With Quartr’s productivity tools, companies can stay up to date with the entire global financial market searchable. By solving the most pressing problems and owning the distribution scale, the aim is to become the home of investor communication. Sami Osman, Quartr CEO and Co-founder, explained: “By being able to access any company call, document, or other data point within a few seconds, we are seeing a considerable proportion of institutional investors signing up on Quartr as their new go-to-place on mobile. And owning the scale of distribution will make Quartr the new home of company communication, with millions of investors researching companies every day” The app is available for free on iOS and Android and has already over 2.5 million played events from more than 5,500 companies in 19 markets. Users are accessing valuable company information – such as earnings calls, investor presentations, PDFs of the transcripts, and earnings reports – from the likes of Apple, Meta, Spotify, Moderna, as well as all other publicly listed companies. Rather than the traditional method of dialling in live to discover company information, all data can now be found within a few clicks. This fresh funding comes as the young startup rolls out its latest feature – Insights. This tool uses data from S&P Global to provide valuable but often inaccessible company data, including analyst estimates and financials. It’s been an exciting journey for the Swedish team who reported over 300k downloads in 160+ countries in its first year. It also recently launched a “Search For Anything” feature, where all company transcripts worldwide on the platform are included in the same search engine, timestamped to audio so users can scroll to key moments. Partnering with companies like US vaccine pioneer Moderna, Swedish mobile gaming giant LeoVegas and German unicorn Westwing, Quartr’s popular feature, Embedded Player, also allows companies to include their presentations on websites, articles, and blog posts. Now, looking to the future, this seed funding will help boost the company’s aim to shake up investor relations for the better. Putting the capital to use, the team of 42 want to scale its development team and add additional products. A B2C app and B2B desktop solution are both in the pipeline. Sami added: “We are proud to introduce the participation of several high-profile investors who all started as Quartr users. Although the B2C value prop is somehow proven by attracting more than 300,000 users in the first year – we’re glad to announce several IR managers and IR consultants seeing what we’re building for companies and wanting to invest. With product leading our growth, the capital will almost exclusively go to further recruitment of tech talent to serve the problems our customers are experiencing. With so many trillions of dollars circulating in the financial industry, it’s fascinating to see how far left behind the UX of some existing tools still are.” Johan Malm, CEO at The Öhman Group, said: “Quartr is revolutionizing the investment process at both ends, reshaping the communications and decision-making of both companies and investors. The company is providing a truly unique service to the investment world, and it’s been exciting to be a part of it. We have been so impressed with their growth and leadership so far and are delighted to continue our journey with them.”"
2022.7.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/europe-and-the-uk-are-leading-the-world-in-the-fight-against-climate-change-interview-with-ellen-moeller-from-watershed/,"Climate tech is one of the fastest-growing verticals in innovation at the moment. With governments, organisations and businesses all trying to catch up with ambitious carbon plans, tech innovation is proving pivotal in helping Europe reach Net-Zero. It’s been reported that globally more than $40 billion went to climate tech startups in 2021, however, the reality is many solutions are tokenistic with no real tech. Aiming to change this is fast-growing startup Watershed. Doubling down on how businesses manage, report, and reduce carbon emissions, the climate tech startup has set up European headquarters in London. The company, founded in 2019, empowers companies on the road to Net-Zero across the entire process – from the hardware they buy to how they build their HQs. It’s all part of the vision to help businesses build an actionable plan to become carbon neutral. Watershed’s clients include the biggest EU players in BNPL and streaming, and they’re partnering with critical EU thought leaders like Mark Carney and Christiana Figueres. We chatted with Ellen Moeller to find out more. She shared with us how fintech’s, in particular, can benefit from creating climate plans and why Europe is leading the way in global climate innovation. Can you tell us about Watershed? What is the company’s vision? Watershed is the all-in-one climate platform that gives companies the tools and expertise they need to measure, reduce, remove, and report their carbon emissions—getting them to net zero faster. We have an ambitious mission: to remove 500+ megatonnes of CO2 from the world’s atmosphere annually—and companies that work with us play an important role in moving us closer to that goal. Whether doing their first emissions footprint, shopping for clean power or carbon credits, figuring out how to decarbonize their supply chain, or navigating the alphabet soup of climate disclosure programs, Watershed gives companies a complete climate program in one easy-to-use platform. Watershed just opened up co-HQs in London – what is the benefit of this? Europe and the UK are leading the world in the fight against climate change, setting ambitious targets and legislation across multiple policy areas, and binding emissions targets for key sectors of the economy. Many of our largest customers are based in the region, including Klarna, Spotify and Revolut (to name a few). We’re deeply familiar with the unique challenges and opportunities companies face in Europe, and we feel strongly that our enterprise climate platform meets a critical need—but we’ll never be successful if we take a one-size-fits-all approach. I joined Watershed as the Head of Europe after spending six years leading EMEA Partnerships and Operations at Stripe, and am actively growing our presence in the region. Watershed is helping companies get to net-zero – can you tell us how the company goes about this? Watershed helps companies accurately measure their carbon footprint, then design and implement climate programs to help get them to net zero emissions, with a strategic plan built for their business that includes concrete emissions reduction targets. Our software platform is built by a world-class team of engineers, climate experts, and data scientists who previously helped develop data-driven products and climate programs at companies like Airbnb, Apple, Stripe, and Meta. One of the big differences between Watershed and our competitors is that we measure your carbon footprint based on actual business data, rather than generic estimates. We do this by integrating with your existing technology systems, like ERP and CRM, to ingest unstructured data from millions of lines of invoices, spreadsheets, and documents. From there, each business can analyse its emissions and, in partnership with our expert climate advisors, design actionable strategies to reduce and remove emissions. Our customers also get exclusive access to a marketplace of high-quality, pre-vetted carbon removal partners who are actively developing technologies to permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere right now. Finally, we enable one-click reporting so companies can easily share progress with employees, investors, and regulators, instantly. Why are fintechs emitting so much carbon? Surely they can easily be carbon-neutral? The fascinating thing about emissions is that a vast majority of them come from a company’s indirect activities, rather than direct actions. These are known as Scope 3 emissions, and they’re the furthest removed from a company’s day-to-day actions (known as Scope 1 emissions), which also makes them hardest to control. So while fintechs and other technology or services companies may seem like they wouldn’t have significant carbon emissions because they don’t produce smartphones or mill wood into paper, a huge share of modern emissions are deeper in a company’s infrastructure or supply chain—like the servers and software that power a technology company, which can be very power-intensive. Among forward-thinking customers who want to address the full scope of their emissions, Watershed helps give them visibility into every scope of emissions so they can take meaningful action. What exactly is a ‘climate program’? A climate program is a company’s plan for reaching its sustainability target, such as net-zero emissions. A good climate program includes emissions from Scope 1-3 (as outlined above), and will be based on real-time data and analytics to put actionable goals in place. Climate programs should ultimately be integrated into every business decision, from which energy provider to use, to employee travel policies and investing in permanent carbon removal. What about funding in the climate space – how do you see it right now? Is there a lot of greenwashing, tick-boxing – or can we genuinely be optimistic about the space? Both are true. While greenwashing certainly exists, there’s also plenty of cause to be optimistic. When we talk to customers, we find that they truly value the science-based, data-driven approach we take to measuring their emissions and helping them develop reduction plans. We’re seeing customers become a lot more sophisticated and discerning, very quickly. How is Europe driving positive carbon reduction strategies? Do you think the majority of the initiative is coming from startups/entrepreneurs or the government? Europe is leading the world when it comes to setting climate regulations, such as SFDR and the upcoming CSRD, which will affect an estimated 50,000 businesses in the EU. But I also believe that it cannot solely be a top-down approach—and our customers know that, too. Businesses have a real opportunity to make a positive impact by engaging their supply chain partners, employees, and competitors to drive bottom-up results, and in many cases, the private sector is leading the market How can European companies embed more climate-positive strategies? While there is no universal quick-fix plan for all companies, there are a few key tenets of climate-positive strategies that each business should consider. First and foremost is the switch to clean energy. Second comes more intense scrutiny of internal operations, from travel policies to cloud computing to supply chain partners. This is where a lot of work can be done, but also where each business will differ. And third is a real investment in permanent carbon removal, without which we won’t achieve global net-zero goals. In sum, this means that carbon must be front and center of every business decision a company makes. What are the biggest trends in the carbon-reduction movement? There are a few interesting things happening right now. 1. Tech is being applied to more mature carbon removal methodologies, like reforestation. One example is our partner Living Carbon who is improving the carbon sequestration and durability of trees. 2. A more critical eye is being held toward ensuring carbon credits actually make an impact; we’re seeing new ratings companies come into the market to help with this, like Bezero. 3. High-caliber talent from across industries are entering the carbon removal market and bringing new entrepreneurial approaches, for example, Peter Reinhardt, the former CEO of Segment, who founded Charm. How can we continue innovating and growing greentech initiatives? It’s important that we see continued investment in critical climate technologies, such as permanent carbon removal, to help scale them over time and build a necessary market for their success. Early and sustained investment in these innovative sustainability technologies is a key lever to ensure they can be part of the solution to climate change. It’s one of the reasons we built a dedicated carbon removal marketplace into the Watershed platform—we want to give these really exciting, budding technologies a more powerful outlet for investment and awareness. What do you think is next in this space? Climate is increasingly top of mind for both investors and employees. We expect to see a tremendous amount of innovation in the climate space, and a large wave of funding to support it. Furthermore, we expect more and more individuals to transition their careers into the climate space as the impacts of climate change increasingly hit home. (p.s. Watershed is hiring quickly!) I’ll reiterate that even though the climate news we hear is dire, there’s a ton of opportunity and reason for hope, and we’re really excited to be a part of the solution."
2022.7.13,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/barcelona-based-zinklar-nabs-e5-5-million-for-its-martech-platform-empowering-brands-with-better-insights/,"Martech startup Zinklar has just secured €5.5 million in Series A funding for its insights platform. The Barcelona-based company is fuelling better connections between brands and people by making high-quality insights more accessible. For brands, getting to know their customers is crucial to business success. It’s a marketing team’s aim – to learn about their customers, and potential customers, and then deliver products, content and experiences that are most attractive to the target audience. Making access to the insights that make this easier, Barcelona-based Zinklar has just secured €5.5 million. The funding was led by Caixa Capital Risc. It saw participation from Beacon Capital, EASO Ventures, Full Global investments and CDTI Innvierte. Alongside the funding, a representative from Beacon joins Zinklar’s board which includes figures from Caixa Capital, Inveready and the founders of the company themselves. Founded in 2015, Zinklar automates insights to offer brands detailed and actionable information about consumer preferences quickly, simply and with greater efficiency. These valuable pieces of information about consumer needs, wants and desires improve a company’s decision-making processes and help to boost revenues. Founder and CEO Jordi Ferrer explained: “Our vision is that any professional from any company can access the best research at any time, without needing to be an expert, and thus be able to put the consumer at the centre of their decision making.” Via the platform, companies can gain access to insights from 140 million consumers from more than 80 countries. The resulting data enables marketing teams to then identify efficient segmentation options, launch new products and services with success, create more powerful campaigns, increase market value and more. The martech platform also allows businesses to establish conversations with consumers to gain greater insights. What makes Zinklar particularly powerful is that it is completely automized – meaning the whole process is streamlined and optimised. It reports that companies are able to create up to 15x more research projects with the same resources. As a result, consumer opinions can be taken into account in real-time. Time is of the essence to any business and so this efficiency is incredibly valuable. Maria Dramalioti-Taylor, Managing Partner en Beacon, added: “Over the next decade, brands will face unprecedented challenges as they try to adapt to changing consumer behaviour in a new cash-constrained environment. To drive growth, they will have to start from scratch when it comes to how they access consumer insights. Created by two research-savvy founders, the Zinklar platform brings a sea change to the way insights are generated. By combining orthodoxy in market research with artificial intelligence, Zinklar automates processes and compresses the time and cost of studies.” The Barcelona-based startup was founded by Jordi Ferrer and Borja Ormaechea. The Director team bring a cumulative 50+ years of experience in market research – earned in companies like Kantar, Ipsos, Salesforce and Linkedin. Zinklar’s service is already available in over 80 countries, and with this new funding, the team want to grow further. The startup’s main aim is to continue expanding its presence internationally, targeting the US, Europe and Latam. More than 300 companies have used the product already and this new capital boost will help accelerate the company’s presence and product offering. Existing clients include powerful global brands such as Google, Hershey’s, Panasonic, The Body Shop, Caixa Bank and Disney. Founder Jordi Ferrer commented: “This series A represents a great milestone for Zinklar. With greater automation, we can continue to advance in the democratization of insights and ensure that any company can have access to high-quality market research. From the largest companies, who can multiply their studies to cover more research needs in more countries, to SMEs, who can now obtain the information they have always needed to better understand their consumers and start making informed and fast decisions.” Xavier Álvarez, Managing Director of Tech Investments en Caixa Capital Risc said: “At Caixa Capital Risc we are proud to lead this strategic round of financing to continue supporting Zinklar, which includes financing from our new Criteria Venture Tech fund. We firmly believe in the disruptive power of Zinklar’s insights automation platform, already backed by the trusted by numerous international clients from different sectors. With this new funding, Zinklar will increase its market leadership and continue to lead the way in the evolution of the multi-billion dollar research and data analysis industry.”"
2022.7.14,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/paris-based-fintech-startup-hero-scores-e12-4-million-for-its-full-stack-payments-solution/,"Taking a fresh perspective on the payments chain, fintech startup Hero has raised €12.4 million for its full-stack solution. The Paris-based startup is specifically targeting B2B SME’s with its innovative product. The payments space is continuing to experience lots of innovation this year. From BNPL solutions to embedded finance solutions, it’s the fintech sector that seems just to keep giving. Now, taking a fresh look at the payments chain – from a horizontal angle – Paris-based Hero has scored €12.4 million to scale its solution. The funding for the Parisian startup was led by Paua Ventures and Embedded/capital alongside Rapyd Ventures. A host of fintech angels and operators are also joining: Guillaume Princen (Stripe), Phillippe de Passorio (Adyen), Peter O’higgins (Revolut), Steve Anavi (Qonto), Fabrice Grinda (FJ labs), Barbora Winczerva (Mubadala) and Perry Blacher (Augmentum), Josef Bovet (Tiller) and Joan Burkovic (Bankin’). Founded in 2021 by Roland Jais Nielson, Hero offers full-stack payment solutions for B2B SMEs, providing solutions from liquidity to digital payment on all sales channels. Roland explained: “Hero started out as an intermediary to B2B transactions, taking on the financial and credit risk of both counterparties and helping them optimize their cash flows. We quickly realized that lowering cost-to-transact for SMEs also implied better underwriting, centralizing all sales channels and payment methods, third-party integration, and end-to-end automation. We built Hero around this holistic vision.” Typically, innovators in the payments chain focus on just one vertical. However, Hero is building a horizontally integrated platform – managing both sides of a translation. It, therefore, makes an impact on procure-to-pay for clients and order-to-cash for suppliers. This brings seamless and transparent underwriting to the market, offering instantaneous financing terms. The solution is specifically adapted to SMEs, which remain underserved by incumbent banks. Hero is able to manage all sales channels – whether it be offline, online or in-store, and all payment types for any company size. This is a major leap forward for SMEs, enabling them to completely streamline and optimise processes. Lastly, the platform allows for seamless integrations with third-party B2B software, including ERPs, marketplaces and accounting tools. Again, for SMEs, this is a refreshing approach that makes their lives much simpler. Georg Stockinger, Managing Partner of Paua Ventures, highlighted this: “Hero stands out from others in the space because it makes payments in offline B2B commerce as seamless as an online B2C checkout experience while embedding credit into any transaction. A host of integrations into the most widely used B2B commerce sales, ERP and accounting tools, helped with rapid adoption. This is why after only 7 months of inception, Hero managed to onboard over 200 merchants, power 10,000+ transactions and is growing at an astounding 30% month over month.”"

2022.7.14,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/10-super-fast-growing-barcelona-based-startups-to-watch-in-2022-and-beyond/,"Barcelona hits the headlines for many reasons. It’s the city the EU-Startups team calls home and it’s one of Europe’s hottest innovation hubs for 2022. Barcelona is producing exciting startups across a multitude of verticals, nurturing them from early-stage right up to unicorn heights. From the likes of Glovo and TravelPerk to Wallbox and Adevinta, Barcelona has been rightly labelled as a “unicorn territory”. And, let’s not forget those up-and-coming disruptive companies, such as Heura, who are making themselves known on a global scale. The city is seen by many as one of the most popular cities from which to launch a startup in Europe – and it’s not hard to see why. It’s a city that oozes energy. The vibrant city streets, mellowed by the Mediterranean breeze, make this city one that just feels exciting to be in. From touristic triumphs and football fever to entrepreneurial excellence, it’s a city that is truly always on the go. With an increasingly metropolitan community, made up of highly skilled locals, digital nomads and young professionals, alongside an incredibly attractive lifestyle, it’s somewhat of a heaven on earth for startups and naturally harvests the best of startup culture. Makes sense that it’s home to some of Europe’s coolest entrepreneurial events – such as the EU-Startups Summit – and some of Europe’s most influential incubators, investors and accelerators. We wanted to take a look at some early-stage startups from this burgeoning hub, highlighting some companies that will be good to keep an eye on in the years ahead. So, we put together this list of startups all founded post-2019 and based out of the Catalan capital. Impress: Founded in 2019, Impress is leading digitisation in orthodontics. The startup, founded by renowned orthodontist Dr. Khaled Kasem and serial entrepreneurs Diliara and Vladimir Lupenko, combined traditional dentistry approaches with pioneering technology to create a hybrid tech-driven orthodontic clinic. The startup raised a whopping €123 million in July 2022 – just three years after its launch. The company’s network of hybrid clinics has been growing fast and they all leverage a top-tier clinical team and vertically integrated tech stack. Customer experience is also a top priority for the company, and perhaps one of the reasons behind its intense popularity. To his end, the startup has a mobile app whereby patients and doctors can enjoy improved contact and schedule appointments. To date, the company now has more than 130 clinics across 8 different countries and more than 1000 employees. Ukio: Founded in 2020, Ukio is disrupting the real estate market and empowering people to feel at home wherever they go. The startup provides furnished and serviced apartments for stays of one month or more, removing all the hassle of finding a rental, with no need to worry about long-term contracts, moving and buying furniture, security deposits and more – giving choice and flexibility to allow people to live where and when they want. So, if you want to relocate to another city in Europe, the tech offering from Ukio helps you to do so without the usual headaches. Now present in Barcelona, Madrid and Lisbon, the young startup raised €7.8 million and is now making moves to expand through Europe – first stops being Berlin and London. In 2021, the real estate tech group hired an additional 70 employees, grew the portfolio to nearly 200 homes and had a 96% occupancy rate (that’s despite disruption to the travel industry). All of this means the company is embarking on an exciting 2022 and with growing trends among millennials and Gen Z to try life in new cities for a time, largely facilitated by the growth of remote work, they’re definitely one to watch. Yaba: Born in the streets of Barcelona in 2020, Yaba is an aggregator company for digital-native brands that sell via Amazon. The founders Alejandro Fresneda, David Baratech, Rubén Ferreiro, Sergi de Pablos and Patxi Archanco have the aim to accelerate the growth of these small companies and optimise their presence on Amazon and similar digital marketplaces. There are a lot of aggregator companies out there, so what makes Yaba special? Well, it stands out thanks to its proprietary tech, through which, the platform can develop real-time dashboards which provide complete visibility into the day-to-day operations of its brands. This in turn generates predictive models and thus empowers informed decisions to be made around how to increase business efficiency – in all areas from stock management to online branding and distribution. Earlier this year, the team nabbed €75 million and is planning to end the year having purchased 30 companies. HUBUC: Fintech startup HUBUC describes itself as an embedded finance “powerhouse” behind any brand that wants to offer financial services. Essentially, it is a one-stop source for payment capabilities, and can seamlessly embed financial services into the customer journey of any brand. Examples of payment capabilities offered include payment acceptance, payment processing, issuing of physical and virtual cards and white label solutions. It specializes in providing embedded finance to SaaS companies, taking away compliance headaches. The startup was founded in 2020 and is nestled in the bustling port of Barcelona. The team scored about €9.95 million at the start of this year and has been scaling fast, now operating in 58 countries. Freeverse: Entering the NFT game, Freeverse.io is marking itself as a strong player and worthy component. The startup has developed a unique product in the market, allowing companies to build products that feature next-generation NFTs – so-called ‘living assets’. Just when we got used to digital assets, Freeverse came and shook the playing board up again. Freeverse’s core product is a platform that allows companies (such as brands, game developers, or other content creators) to add a new layer to their products: the ability of NFTs to change and evolve based on how they are used by their owners. This means the NFT value is impacted by how it is used, rather than its rarity or scarcity, which is a whole new approach to the market. It also tackles one strong underlying critique of NFTs – that they rely too heavily on speculation. Now, with Freeverse, they can change and evolve. The startup picked up €10 million in May this year and it was founded in 2019. 011h:Founded in 2020, 011H’s aim is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable building development. Its way of working not only means the buildings created are more sustainable, efficient and environmentally friendly, but also results in cheaper costs, shorter execution times, and better overall reliability. The construction industry has been transforming recently – perhaps slower to the digital transformation than other sectors, it’s now starting to catch up and 011h is helping drive the transition, putting productivity, sustainability and efficiency to the forefront. The startup was founded by Lucas Carné and José Manuel Villanueva and has now raised over €10 million. Payflow: Launched in 2020, Payflow got 2022 off to a bumper start and has shown no signs of slowing down. In January the team picked up €8 million bringing its total funding to around €14.5 million. Operating in the fintech space, Payflow has developed an app that allows employees to instantly access earned wages. Improving employee financial wellbeing is at the heart of Payflow’s philosophy and its approach is proving popular – operating under the vision that given employees work and spend daily, they should have easier and more regular access to their wages – taking control of their finances in the way that makes sense to them. Currently, the company has offices in Spain and is operating in Italy and Portugal. Looking to the future, the team has its eyes set on expansion to Latam with Mexico, Chile and Brazil key targets in South America, adding to its existing presence in Colombia and Peru. Clients of the fintech include NH Hoteles, Isdin and Aravinc.

Operating on an ecommerce model and using tech to personalise dog food products, the startup is fetching lots of attention in the space, scoring €3 million in June this year. Pet tech is a growing space, more and more pet parents are turning to digital solutions to optimise the care and health of their fur babies, and Dogfy Diet is a great example of a startup innovating in the space. The online platform invites owners to introduce some details about their pet, then an algorithm analyzes the different variables that could impact its digestive health.

2022.7.14,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/systemiq-capital-makes-the-first-close-of-fund-ii-to-fuel-the-climate-tech-revolution/,"Climate tech VC fund, Systemiq Capitalhas today announced a near €70 million first close of its second fund, which is targeting about €200 million. The Fund is dedicated to backing early-stage climate tech entrepreneurs, accelerating the transition to a resilient, clean and just global economy. The climate tech space might want to cool the planet down, but it’s an area that is hotting up. As governments, global organisations, businesses and local communities all rally together to sway the tide of climate change, climate tech and innovations helping to protect our planet, are a growing priority for investment and it seems the cash is flowing. Today, Systemiq Capital has announced the first close of its fund at over €69 million. The latest venture by Paul Polman, Jeremy Oppenheim, Systemiq and Irena Spazzapan, Sqystemiq Capital is offering ‘capital for systems change’. Fund II is building on the success of Fund I which was launched in 2018. Investors to date for Fund II include Lombard Odier, Andre Hoffman, The Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, Dara Holdings, Deutsche Post Foundation, Stephen Brenninkmeijer, Mark Cutifani, Erik Fyrwald and Chad Holliday. Building on climate tech expertise Systemiq Capital is an investment platform that is driving forward impact investment. It operated on a model that goes beyond cash, bringing capital, expertise and network to climate tech founders and innovators – aiming to help them scale at speed and effect real change. It is led by Paul Polman, Jeremy Oppenheim and Irena Spazzapan – all bridging their own climate background to the fold. Polman led consumer goods giant Unilever until 2019, where he increased investor returns by 300% while ensuring the company consistently ranked #1 in the world for sustainability each year. He also served on the High-Level Panel that developed the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Meanwhile, Oppenheim, a former World Bank Economist and experienced angel investor, built and led McKinsey’s global climate practice for over a decade, and founded the system-change company, Systemiq. Spazzapan, a former Goldman Sachs commodities executive, has built the early-stage investment practice at Systemiq. While Systemiq Capital is fully independent, it is able to draw on the wider investment and climate tech ecosystem. This enables portfolio companies to access deep knowledge of the trends shaping the sector, gives them enhanced support in navigating complex regulatory environments, and, helps forge strong relationships and connections. Paul Polman said: “We are finally starting to see momentum for a cleaner, fairer, more resilient economy build across business, in finance, among governments and in wider society, and the big question is how can we accelerate these shifts? Making sure the best climate tech innovations are ready and available is key.” Climate Fund II What makes this fund particularly interesting is its promise to go beyond merely cash and contacts – the staple diet of investment funds. There have been plenty of big funds in Europe, but they all seem to be following similar patterns and lacking in substance that can make a real difference to startups – especially for early-stage teams wanting long-term success. This fund however promises to plug innovators into an unparalleled ecosystem of global business leaders, policy-makers and climate experts, to deliver outsize financial returns and climate impact. It is dedicated to backing early-stage teams that have the vision and capability to build the systems underpinning a healthier planet and stronger economy. It has an inherently Europe focus and will link fast-growth climate change innovators with its global network of corporates, policy-makers, and follow-on investors to allow early market adoption. It supports companies which, if scaled, can drive systemic change in four areas at the heart of the fight against climate change: sustainable food and materials, clean transport, climate intelligence and finance, and climate restoration. Existing portfolio companies include those working in synthetic biology and regenerative land use, new chemistries driving low carbon materials; direct and indirect electrification of transport; AI, geospatial analytics and next-gen computing solving for climate; carbon removals and biodiversity restoration. Paul Polman explained the unique approach of the fund: “From developing the home chargers that are essential for getting people into electric vehicles, to pioneering short haul hydrogen flights, these are the start-ups that can catapult our climate ambitions while securing exceptionally healthy returns. But in order to grow, these businesses need more than ‘cash and contacts.’ Systemiq Capital offers its entrepreneurs, it’s investors and humanity a tremendous alignment. In sectors where you have established demand from the market, established need for the planet, and governments and regulators are setting the direction of travel, we bring capital, acumen, expertise and connections. All driven by a shared hunger for systems change”. Time is now for climate action It has been widely acknowledged that every aspect of the global economy will need to undertake an unprecedented, rapid transition to more sustainable ways of operating over the next decade in order to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change has warned that there are less than 10 years to halve global GHG emissions in order to stay under two degrees Celsius. To implement this, it’s estimated that trillions of euros in investment into decarbonisation are needed this decade alone to get on the road to net zero. However, the innovation is there. Startups across Europe are pioneering new innovations and ideas to help accelerate a climate revolution and it’s exciting to witness. Funds like this one are part of the puzzle in helping us get to a healthier, more sustainable planet. Irena Spazzapan said: “The level of talent and innovation among climate tech entrepreneurs right now is immense but we know that, as they face the challenges of commercial scale up, their network of experts, advisors, peers and policy-makers can be as vital as the financing. Systemiq Capital is uniquely placed to identify outstanding early-stage companies and position them in this wider eco-system for success. We are thrilled at the appetite we’ve seen for Fund II. This is capital for systems change, and the strong message from our backers is that we’re filling a major gap in the investment landscape, and it is overdue.” Track record of success From changing the course of the aviation industry to mapping and monitoring businesses’ impact on biodiversity and enabling the futureproofing of physical assets against climate change risk, portfolio companies from Fund I are already creating fundamental systemic change for the benefit of the planet. Portfolio companies include the likes of ZeroAvia, which is pioneering short-haul hydrogen aviation to displace aircraft powered by fossil fuels. Systemiq Capital supported the team to secure their first R&D grant from the UK government and attract further investment across the US and Europe. There’s also Nature Metrics, which established the world’s largest environmental DNA database enabling businesses to better monitor the impacts of their work on biodiversity and the natural world. It was supported to become the lead monitoring partner for the UN-led Global Fund for Coral Reefs and brought into a consortium to participate in the Xprize Rainforest. Jupiter Intelligence is an additional portfolio company that’s scaling fast. The startup, which helps industries understand and mitigate the risk climate change poses to their physical assets, was supported with its impressive European and Asian expansion and the launch of a free model for developing countries. Rich Sorkin, founder and CEO of Jupiter Intelligence said: “Systemiq Capital became one of Jupiter Intelligence’s premier strategic investors 3 years ago. We’ve benefited immensely from Systemiq’s network and introductions to new corporate clients on both sides of the Atlantic. The Systemiq team was also instrumental with the Jupiter Promise, helping us frame the story and funding our services to help low-income countries better quantify, and ultimately address, their physical exposure to climate risk. The team is a joy to work with.”"

Based in London, the company is establishing a new asset class. Owning property across the world is an appealing thought. Many of us have often dreamed about having a flat in Barcelona, a townhouse in London, and a loft in Berlin. Creating a new invest-and-experience asset class, London-based Lilo is making global property shares interactive and collectable – bringing a target market of young professionals the chance to join the exclusive club of people owning global real estate. The startup, founded in April this year by Emily Chan and Christopher Lass, has announced the successful close of a €3 million pre-seed funding round. The fresh capital was led by 468 Capital, followed by Presight Capital and select angel investors. The proptech startup’s platform operates on a membership basis. It enables members to enjoy an enriched mobile lifestyle, reflecting the growing trend of workcations and increasing numbers of digital nomads, by collecting shares in global real estate. The team is purchasing high-end residential properties in desirable locations around the world, with ownership split into up to 8 fractions. Fabian Hansen, General Partner at Presight Capital, said: “The new generation of working professionals and creatives strives toward a flexible lifestyle, but also remains diligent about collecting a diverse range of investments. Real estate’s stability makes it indispensable to any well-balanced portfolio. What we love about Lilo is that it combines the best of both worlds – we’re absolutely thrilled to be part of this journey.” Keeping high-end to the core, Lilo will offer its community exclusive access to curated properties across some of Europe’s most popular and desirable cities, including Barcelona, London, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Berlin. The platform will enable members to assemble a global property portfolio, without the mental and monetary burden that currently exists. Emily Chan, the co-founder at Lilo, explained the vision: “Real estate needs to be re-imagined to better suit our increasingly versatile way of living. We’re creating a new asset class to achieve precisely that – collecting shares in our properties gives our members access to the most sought-after cities in the world, aided by our in-house sourcing and valuation expertise.” Gaining this pre-seed round is a major step for the startup’s ambitions. It’ll be used to expand the team who are eager to hit the ground running and snap up initial properties."
2022.7.15,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/copenhagen-based-medusa-scores-e7-98-million-to-build-a-fresh-open-source-ecommerce-platform/,"Ecommerce startup Medusa has just scored about €7.98 million in Seed funding. The Copenhagen-founded team are taking a fresh approach to ecommerce platforms, with a developer-first open-source approach. Ecommerce has been a rapidly growing vertical across Europe in the past few years. Fuelled by an accelerated digital transformation across industries, almost all commerce now has taken to online approaches. However, despite the tidal wave of change on the front end of these webshops, the majority of ecommerce sites are sitting on legacy platforms, resistant to change. Even Shopify, seen as one of the biggest innovators in the space, is already 15 years old. Now there’s a new face in town – Medusa. Founded in 2021, Medusa is aiming to become the reading ecommerce platform for javascript developers. The Danish startup has just scored about €7.98 million in Seed funding. The round was led by LocalGlobe and Dawn Capital, with the participation of prominent tech leaders such as Anthony Casalena (Squarespace CEO & founder), Nicolas Dessaigne (Algolia founder), and Scott Williamson (Ex-CPO Gitlab). Medusa’s platform solves the pains of merchants wanting to create unique customer experiences and optimize operations, thanks to its developer-first approach. It provides similar core functionality as Shopify out-of-the-box, while its open abstraction-based architecture makes customizations and maintenance much easier to handle for developers as businesses’ needs evolve. The platform gives merchants control of their stack by easily connecting to APIs of payment providers, logistics tools, CMSs, and other systems while enabling a native omnichannel setup through its headless architecture. It gives users the best of both worlds – the functionality they need but also the personalisation they crave to make webshops more tailored to each individual business and target audience. The underlying premise that is driving Medusa’s success is the focus on building a solution for developers, viewing them as the key to unlocking merchant success. Sebastian Rindom, CEO and co-founder of Medusa, explained: “Merchants need to stand out among the crowd and optimize their operations to continue growing in the increasingly competitive e-commerce space. Developers are key to enabling the unique digital commerce experiences that are needed in today’s landscape so we focus on building the best tools possible for developers to be more efficient.” The young startup is already proving popular and making strides with its product. It’s created impressive growth in the developer community, reportedly the most starred Javascript ecommerce platform on GitHub in only eight months, surpassing established solutions such as WooCommerce and Magento. It’s also thanks to this approach that the startup has gained traction amongst investors. Mina Mutafchieva, partner at Dawn, commented: “Medusa immediately attracted our attention with their unique open-source product. Balancing the right level of a user-friendly API-first approach with a great degree of customizability, Medusa’s product is a dream for developers and merchants who need to customize their platforms while maintaining maximum performance and response times.” Mina added: “For all the breakneck innovation we have seen in the frontend, the majority of e-commerce sites sit on legacy platforms, such as Magento, CommerceCloud, etc. Even Shopify, which has transformed access to e-commerce for smaller merchants, is already 15 years old. As a result, the pain points for e-commerce merchants are exploding and most, if not all, we at Dawn have spoken to in the last two years, use inefficient “work-arounds” to achieve their business goals.” Already the developer-centric ecommerce tool is being implemented at webshops making big annual returns, and with the total addressable market expected to grow to over €30 billion by 2025, there’s massive scope for this Copenhagen-based team. Oliver Juhl, CTO & co-founder of Medusa, noted: “Our level of extensibility and customizability allows developers to build powerful commerce setups without compromising the scalability of their business. We see users leveraging Medusa’s composable architecture to power everything from regular D2C brands to advanced subscription products, marketplaces, and B2B businesses.” Medusa, in less than a year of existence, has been able to develop a community of over 2000 developers and has begun over 10k projects. This new funding will be put towards strengthening the core product and further enhancing the development experience. . In addition, Medusa has started offering premium support for agencies and in-house developer teams building on the platform. The company also has big ambitions to go global, with the US seen as a target market to take on. George Henry, general partner at LocalGlobe, also said: “With its open-source approach based on Javascript, we think the Medusa team is building the most powerful platform to power the next generation of e-commerce experiences as demonstrated by the fact that developers love the product and are adopting it at an unprecedented rate.”"
2022.7.15,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/10-of-europes-most-impressive-coworking-spaces-2/,"Almost every company was obliged to go down the remote route during the pandemic, and it began a tidal wave of change. It brought fresh ideas to the shore about how we work, where we work and why we work. Now, while we seem to be living in a post-pandemic age, remote and hybrid working is the pandemic-encouraged trend that has endured. It’s a model of working that offers employees the flexibility they crave. With digital transformation across virtually all sectors, it’s also a model that isn’t hampering business outcomes. In fact, many companies find productivity has been boosted by hybrid work – happier, more balanced employees makes for better business after all. The remote and hybrid way of working is here to stay. It’s become embedded in a new lifestyle culture that young professionals crave. It empowers people to work where they feel comfortable, where they feel most productive, and it is allowing a new generation of digital nomads and workcation-ers. Even companies themselves are going fully remote, you can also check out our guide on how startups can do this successfully. Further, just this month, the Dutch Parliament has even approved a proposal to make “Work from Home” a legal right. One outcome of remote and hybrid working is also the need for workspaces. Whilst there is of course the option to literally ‘work-from-home’, this doesn’t necessarily work for some people. With distractions in the household, a lack of dedicated office space, to struggling to focus – there are different reasons why working from home might not suit someone. However, this doesn’t mean missing out on the benefits of remote and hybrid work – there’s also the rise of coworking spaces. Coworking is centred on the concept of providing a space whereby individuals can work independently or collaboratively in a shared space. Across Europe, the popularity of these spaces is skyrocketing. It’s become almost a lifestyle – an experience, that puts you in contact not only with other people like you but also with a community, nature, scenery or even adventure! Here are some of Europe’s most impressive coworking spaces. If you are working remotely or on a hybrid model – we recommend you check these out in person and see them for yourself.

2022.7.15,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/spanish-edtech-startup-twenix-picks-up-e3-5-million-to-enhance-professional-language-skills/,"Almería-founded edtech startup Twenix has just picked up €3.5 million. The company is helping break down language barriers with a digital approach and is now planning further expansion across Southern Europe. Part of the richness of European culture is the variety of languages and dialects found across the continent. One can drive a couple of hours and find themselves listening to conversations in a different tongue, and it makes this region so unique. However, when it comes to business, language can be a barrier to success. Helping to break this barrier down and enhance the acquisition of English communication skills, edtech startup Twenix has just scored €3.5 million. The Series A funding was led by Brighteye. JME Ventures and Inveready have also continued to support the project, in addition to different business angels. These investors have once more shown their trust in Twenix by investing again after being part of previous rounds. The last financing round was in December 2021, when Banco Sabadell also participated. Born in Almería, Twenix was founded in 2017 and now has a presence in Madrid, Barcelona and Milan. The vision behind the company is to tackle the lack of English training available that’s focused on companies and professionals in the labour market. So, Twenix have stepped up the game with its accessible e-learning proposition. The platform offers a methodology based on improving verbal communication and is aimed at enabling users to put their knowledge of the English language into practice from day one. Based on 1to1 classes with teachers from all over the world, the user is immersed in situations that they would find in their place of work or personal environment, obtaining the necessary tools to achieve their objectives through the language. Ben Wirz, Partner at Brighteye, explained: “Twenix gives businesses a uniquely affordable, efficient way to build language learning proficiency, unlocking incredible value for employers and employees alike. We’re very excited to help the team grow, enabling companies to better use English language training to attract, retain and grow talent across Europe.” Currently, Twenix is working with more than 230 teachers from all over the world – triple the number compared to June of last year, and in only 6 months they have exceeded all of the classes taught in 2021. In addition, the edtech team of 70+ is now working with over 400 companies. It’s a startup that is growing fast and well-positioned in its market. Looking forward to the next steps, Twenix has exciting plans to develop the platform with new improvements to be launched. One such improvement will be last-minute bookings – classes which can be booked just 15 minutes in advance. What’s more, Twenix will launch a new service where users can access a library with different specialised content to reinforce other skills such as “listening” and “reading” and maximise their 1to1 class results. This fresh capital raise will be used to strengthen Twenix’s position in the international market, focusing on its establishment in Italy, as well as on further developing its methodology and digital platform. On the other hand, Twenix will seek to grow its business model by strengthening its reach and support to companies and businesses. Jorge Moreno, CEO of Twenix, commented: “We are very pleased that top-level partners such as Brighteye, JME, and Inveready continue to count on us to keep Twenix growing and breaking down the English communication barrier among professionals all around the world. This round of funding is essential to continue investing in the expansion to Italy, a market that excites us. After months of traction with very positive results, it represents a first step towards the internationalisation of Twenix in other European countries.”"
2022.7.15,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/kaunas-based-elinta-charge-gets-e7-million-boost-for-its-ev-charging-stations/,"Lithuanian startup Elinta Charge, a spinoff from Elinta Group, has raised €7 million for its electric vehicle charging solution. The green tech company designs and assembles stations for residential and commercial use and provides intelligent insights. Moving to electric vehicles is key to Europe’s strategy to reduce carbon emissions. Electric vehicles offer a greener way for citizens to travel and continue enjoying comfortable mobility. As with many of the initiatives across Europe to achieve net zero, fueling the achievement of ambitious targets are innovative startups. In this case, Kaunas-based Elinta Charge is helping the transition to electric vehicles by making charging, and associated insights, more readily available. Founded in 2018, Elinta Charge designs and assembles EV charging stations for commercial and residential use. In addition, its platform provides cloud-based intelligent software for fleet managers, as well as operators of public spaces, offices, hospitality and other facilities. To further fuel development, the company just scored €7 million in fresh funding in a round led by AVIA Capital and LitCapital. Piotr Panasiewicz, Director at AVIA Capital, said “Elinta Charge is an innovative company operating in the booming EV market, whose charging solutions are valued by clients and industry experts for their functionality, durability and aesthetics. The company knows how to service demanding corporate clients and cities, supporting green transport while preserving the beauty and functionality of the urban landscape. We are happy to come aboard as investors and support further growth, not least because this investment will have a positive impact on the environment.” The European Union has set a target of tripling the number of publicly accessible charging points to 1 million by 2025 and banned the sale of new cars with combustion engines from 2035. Around the world, the number of public charging points will increase 12-18 times by 2030, according to International Energy Agency estimates. It’s a market that needs fresh innovation in order to unlock the potential of EVs and to realistically achieve targets, and Elinta Charge is stepping up to the plate. The company’s tech is already installed in more than 30 countries across 4 continents. Ignas Mikutis, Elinta Charge CEO, explained: “While Elinta Charge is already achieving outstanding growth, we’re only just getting started on tapping into the enormous potential in the EV technology space. With rising support from individuals, businesses and regulators, electric vehicles are becoming an increasingly inevitable part of our daily lives. This is an exciting market to be in, and our focus on refined design, high-end engineering and smart functionalities produces e-mobility infrastructure solutions that are both elegant and durable, delighting infrastructure operators and EV drivers alike.” This fresh funding boost will be used by the Lithuanian-based startup to explore production opportunities in Poland, benefiting from the country’s strong automotive component sector, supportive R&D policy and infrastructure, as well as its proximity to key EU markets. It’ll also supercharge Elinta Charge’s growth – creating new products and services, developing next-generation software, and, recruiting top engineers and programmers. Šarūnas Šiugžda, Founder and Managing Partner at LitCapital, added: “Considering the solid market potential, coupled with our strong belief in the engineering talent at Elinta Charge and the outstanding product they have built, we are extremely glad to be able to join as investors.”"

2022.7.18,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/supporting-ukraines-startup-ecosystem-an-inside-look-into-the-eics-e20-million-fund/,"Since February of this year, Ukraine has been fighting against Russian invasion. Amid the onslaught of bombings and atrocities, Europe’s wider startup community has been standing firm to support Ukraine, and to bolster what was a thriving ecosystem of innovation. In 2019, Mariupol, a city now devastated by shelling, received two smart city awards – ‘Startup City’ and ‘Best City Transport Model’. Kharkiv is known to be the birthplace of Ukraine’s first unicorn, Gitlab. While Odesa is home to well-known startups like Looksery (now owned by Snapchat). Ukraine’s tech scene was thriving thanks to a highly-skilled workforce and a commitment to innovation. The country was also developing itself as a leader in fuelling the green energy transition with promising developments and innovation in climate and green tech. With a strong tradition in the energy industry, it was a nation pushing forward developments in renewables, electric vehicles and the use of hydrogen. Earlier this year, we documented some of the major initiatives that startups across Europe took – finding this a great way to highlight the strength of solidarity and how we can rally together for progress. In June, a new initiative came forward – specifically to help Ukrainian deep tech startups, and it’s gotten support from the European Innovation Council. Sparked by the CEO of Estonian supercapacitor startup, Skeleton Technologies, Taavi Madiberk, in his role as a board member of the European Innovation Council, a €20 million support fund has been launched. The fund will support immediate organisations, such as startups, enterprise support centres, incubators, accelerators and so on that are established in Ukraine or that have had to relocate since Russia’s February invasion. It gives particular attention to supporting women-led companies working on innovative solutions that will help Ukraine rebuild and recover. We chatted to Taavi as well as TechUkraine Director Nataly Veremeeva to find out more. Before the war began, how would you have described Ukraine’s startup ecosystem? Nataly: Before the war, Ukrainian tech sector was actively growing. IT Outsourcing segment was the 3rd biggest exporting segment of UA economy, we have 3 Unicorns and a vast number of successful international product companies. The number of startups was increasing, new and new investors were entering the market and high-risk seed and preseed financing was covered by the state Ukrainian Startup Fund. You can find the exact numbers here. Taavi: Before February 24, 2022, Ukraine had – and still has – one of the fastest-growing startup ecosystems in Europe. As Nataly alluded to, in 2021 Ukrainian IT exports grew 36% year-on-year to a total USD 6.8 billion, representing 10% of the country’s total exports. This growth was set to accelerate further in 2022 until the full-scale war started. Europeans don’t always realize but Kyiv alone is home to over 1,000 successful startups and product companies and has several startup clusters. One of them is UNIT.City, the biggest innovation park in Central and Eastern Europe. Ukraine’s IT growth was not only driven by Kyiv, though, but by other cities too. In 2019 Mariupol received two major international smart city awards: “Startup City” and “Best City Transport Model,” while Kharkiv is the birthplace of the first Ukrainian unicorn, GitLab. Lviv is also a top city for startups and IT specialists, hosting the Lviv IT Arena every year, one of the main IT events in CEE region. Many Ukrainian cities are startup cities, as you can see. Besides the startup ecosystem, Ukraine has also been extremely innovative in terms of e-administration, much more than most countries that are members of the EU. In 2019, Ukraine began implementing the “Country in a Smartphone” program. Hundreds of public services were digitalized, just as Estonia also did. The “Diya“ smartphone application was central to these efforts and became the main personal ID for millions of Ukrainians. It is important to note that the digital transformation of Ukraine also doesn’t rely on the purchase of imported solutions. Instead, it was based on the tailored work of Ukrainian IT engineers. This is only natural given the remarkable rise of the Ukrainian IT sector over the past few decades. The Key Verticals In Ukraine, the key tech verticals have traditionally been in fintech, business software, hardware, cybertech and martech. However, as noted by Taavi, energy tech and agritech have been thriving in recent years. Taavi: I want to highlight the key role Ukraine can play in Europe’s energy transition. Thanks to its tradition of industry and innovation, the production of equipment for renewable energy, batteries, electric vehicles, hydrogen and other solutions to get rid of dependence on fossil fuels will probably be a major focus of the revival of Ukrainian industry. Regarding AgriTech, there are very promising startups with excellent hardware developers, for instance offering drones to spray fields, or offering urban farming solutions. I have no doubt these verticals will boom in the near future. The EIC Fund Launching a €20 million fund to support startups and innovation in Ukraine is not only a concrete sign of support for the nation from the heart of Europe, but it is also symbolic of the promise the startup ecosystem there holds. It reflects the strength of the innovation and entrepreneurial community and shows a strong commitment to the long-term recovery of Ukraine. Supporting over 200 Ukrainian deeptech startups, which are either still in Ukraine or have since relocated to the EU, the fund will help young companies continue operations and move closer to the EU tech sector. The Key Aims Taavi: More than 70% of Ukrainian start-ups are continuing to operate despite the war and they need support. It is critical that continuity is not broken. Ukraine had developed a great tech sector over the years, and this is particularly true with respect to deeptech. Deeptech requires strong cooperation between science, research, and business, and this has to remain. And deeptech strongly needs public backing, especially in the development phase. Last but not the least, it is important to integrate these companies into European markets, and the European innovation ecosystem. This will benefit Europe as a whole. Investing in Ukrainian tech is investing in the European tech of the future. The fund will give out grants of up to €60,000, to Ukrainian deeptech start-ups, as mentioned, in addition to providing business advice and matchmaking services. We wanted to take a deeper look at the fund, finding out how it came about and the power behind it. So, what prompted Taavi to push for this initiative? Taavi: When the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine started, I immediately realized that all kinds of support was going to be needed for Ukrainians to win this war, and that it was the responsibility of all Europeans and all European organizations. I couldn’t imagine doing business as usual. The discussion was initiated at the EIC Board meeting in Paris in early March and I am very glad that the European Commission moved quickly. The work done by Commissioner Gabriel has been impressive. We now need to make sure this money and support is delivered to the companies as soon as possible. How does this fund represent the strength of Europe’s wider startup community? Taavi: It shows Europe’s wider startup community truly considers Ukraine’s tech ecosystem to be a European ecosystem. Thus, Europe is willing to support it and boost and strengthen ties between the Ukrainian tech community and the rest of Europe. There’s a strong will to help, using any and all means, and in most European countries, the startup community has been very much involved in supporting Ukraine. So this fund represents our strength: it is not only about putting financial resources, but also about providing business advice and cooperation between ecosystems. Why is it so important that we keep investing in Ukraine? How can we convince VCs to keep doing it? Nataly: First of all, most of the startups are alive. They are searching for investments and have interesting ideas, worth putting money into. Second, IT is the most flexible segment of economy, with no heavy infrastructure and with high flexibility. Usually, all that is needed is to relocate people from high-risk areas to lower risk – and the work goes on. Third, now is the unique time to test ideas in such areas as military tech, cyber security, logistics, healthcare, working with content – not in theory, but in real-life situations. This is a unique opportunity to quickly shape the product, test it and make it ready for the market with minimal investment and in the shortest time. Another aspect is the social one. We do need to maintain jobs in the sector and we look at UA Tech as one of the locomotives for the Ukrainian economy, its sustainability and quickest recovery.If you want to support Ukraine – invest in our startups and let’s establish win-win synergies Taavi: The Ukrainian IT sector has shown unprecedented resilience, flexibility, and the ability to withstand incredibly difficult conditions during these months of war. Ukrainians are fighters, they are winners. Despite the war, Ukrainian startups are not giving up or closing their businesses. More than 70% of them stayed in Ukraine despite the war, continuing to operate and develop their products. Their determination is extraordinary. Most Ukraine-based IT specialists I have spoken to are working tremendously hard and tirelessly since February 24th, with the majority of Ukrainian tech companies even still hiring. They want to support their business and their economy. The country has it all: an excellent education system, particularly in STEM; tech unicorns; the entrepreneurial mindset. For European tech and innovation, Ukraine will soon be as important as France, Germany, or Poland. Once the conflict is over, Ukrainian innovators will bring the many tech solutions created during the war to global markets. International interest is likely to be intense. After the war, the country will need modern solutions more than ever. Startup solutions are an opportunity for the Ukrainian economy to reopen. The economic battlefront is extremely important, that’s why it is so important to maintain Ukraine’s innovative potential, to protect what they have achieved.” Beyond money, how else can we support Ukraine’s startup and tech community? Nataly: There are currently numerous programs that are shaped to support Ukraine, it is all in process, everybody is shaping something. We at TechUkraine also need help in our activities. We serve as a connector and communicator about UA Tech abroad and are preparing a number of initiatives, including a more structured channel of communication with startups. We accept donations, you can do this here. For any other investments please contact us at [emailprotected] and we will direct you to the right initiative and organization. Ukraine’s tech and startup community have been proven to be resilient and flexible and it clearly has the ability to withstand challenges and difficult conditions. Supporting the development of new innovations, encouraging entrepreneurship and promoting Ukrainian tech are some of the ways this country is continuing to show its strength and will help pave the road to recovery. It’s encouraging to see the support from Europe isn’t wavering – there’s strength in solidarity. Taavi: We all need to ramp up our efforts to help Ukraine win this war, so I want to tell all Ukrainians that we will keep supporting them until their victory and beyond. I deeply admire all Ukrainian entrepreneurs who are still running their business despite the war. Their resilience and ability to deliver results amid the worst of challenges is one of many reasons that make Ukraine a successful hub for existing and future tech unicorns. I have no doubt that integrating Ukraine to the European tech ecosystem, is going to give a huge boost to Europe’s tech, research and deeptech."
2022.7.18,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/ghent-based-storychief-picks-up-e3-4-million-in-fresh-funding-for-its-digital-content-marketing-platform/,"Martech startup StoryChief has just announced a raise of €3.4 million to scale its digital platform for content marketing. The Belgian startup is helping marketing teams streamline and centralise processes through smart integrations and AI. With content continuing to grow in importance for marketing teams, the space is welcoming fresh innovation that streamlines, centralises and enhances processes. Ghent-based StoryChief aims to do just that with its digital platform. The startup just raised €3.4 million in a fresh round led by Capricorn Partners via their Capricorn Digital Growth Fund. Existing investors Peak, Anthony De Clerck, Pieter Casneuf, Johan Van Damme, and Willem Delbare also participated alongside Valeri Potchekailov, Brik De Maeyer, and Gregory Claeyssens. On top of the capital injection, StoryChief raises a grant from Vlaio to make StoryChief smarter with an AI layer on top of their existing product. Launched in 2017, StoryChief centralises the process of editorial teams and social media managers. The result is a platform that is enhancing collaborations, making content distribution more efficient, and, giving marketing teams more overview of content performance. On a mission to help teams use content in the most optimised way possible in order to drive growth, StoryCheif also has integration capabilities with existing CMS, DAM and CRM systems. It means that marketing teams can quickly enhance their processes and benefit from improved content distribution and analytics. Used by agencies and marketing teams, it helps users manage their content life cycle in one place from planning, briefing, multi-channel optimization, approval, publishing, and analytics. StoryChief can therefore enhance the customer’s digital footprint, bring in new leads, and increase sales. Steven Lambert, investment director Capricorn Partners, explained: “StoryChief is first mover in the next generation of smart marketing platforms which will not only replace point solutions, but also cover the entire content life cycle in a smart way.” Currently empowering teams in 65 countries, the Ghent-based startup has already proved the scalability of its product. This new funding boost will accelerate its international growth further and enable the development of the platform’s machine learning and AI capabilities. Along with streamlining the processes of collaboration and content publishing, StoryChief is improving its data engine, which helps marketing agencies and enterprises make better decisions when it comes to digital communication. Valeri Potchekailov, Co-founder and CEO StoryChief added: “We see more and more demand coming from larger international marketing teams. Often they work in silos where it is harder for them to stay aligned on external communication. StoryChief breaks that barrier and helps, for example, a marketing lead from Italy easily pick up corporate news from the UK and adjust the message to their local market”. David Zwagemaker, partner Peak, commented: “We’re excited to continue backing StoryChief by co-investing with Capricorn Partners so StoryChief can continue to strengthen its content suite and become a category leader.”"
2022.7.18,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/berlin-based-rex-fetches-e5-million-to-digitise-vet-care-for-a-new-generation-of-pet-owners/,"Berlin-based Rex has just raised €5 million to build veterinary practices of the future. The pet tech startup is bringing the digital world to vet care, focusing on customer experience, digitised processes and first-class care. For pet owners across Europe, having access to quality veterinary care is vital. As pet ownership is growing across the continent, especially among younger generations, it’s an area with plenty of scope to grow and develop. It’s brought about an interesting vertical in the tech space – pet tech – and it’s one that is starting to take off. The veterinary and pet care world has been a little slower to join the digital transformation. Aiming to transform that, and bring vet care into the digital era, Berlin-based Rex has just raised €5 million. The funding was led by Vorwerk Ventures, existing investor Picus Capital and Calm/Storm also participated. Additional investors include founders Vlad Lata and Julian Kley from Avi Medical, Florian Seubert from Zooplus and Simon Bolz and Simon Lorenz from Klara. Founded in 2021 by Jonathan Loesing and Julian Lechner, the aim behind Rex is to establish a chain of modern vet practices – focusing on creating a more convenient experience through digitisation. Jonathan explained: “We’re building pleasant, modern veterinary practices for first-class veterinary care on-site. In combination with digital offers around telemedicine and e-commerce, we offer easy access to services and products for pets and their owners.” Rex will offer a range of digital services including mobile appointment booking, telehealth visits and regular reminders about vaccinations and check-ups to make going to the vet more efficient. It’s reported that millennials now make up the largest generation of pet owners, and it is with this in mind that inspires Rex. Catering to the digital generation, empowering them to be able to better care for their furry friends. As commented by Sascha Guenther, Partner at Vorwerk Ventures: “Unfortunately, most veterinary practices are not tailored to this young target group, as they are severely under-digitised and therefore no longer meet the demands of today’s generation of pet owners. We see great potential in Rex to digitise the veterinary care market, making it more efficient and modern.” This new funding boost will be used to invest in product optimisation, technical upgrades and marketing. Rex opened its first veterinary practice in Berlin-Friedenau in May 2022 and has grown to 25 employees to date. Jonathan added: “We are developing our own practice management software, with which we want to offer both pet owners and vet care staff in the practices the best possible experience.” Oliver Heinrich, Partner at Picus Capital: “Their proprietary software does not only allow Rex to run more efficient practices and relieve veterinarians of administrative burdens by offering a digital interface to the pet owners, Rex offers its customers a portfolio of services and products in addition to physical veterinary care, making the lives of veterinarians, pets and their owners much easier.”"
2022.7.18,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/luxembourg-europes-trusted-data-hub-for-internationalisation-sponsored/,"In our increasingly digital and data-driven world, there are three core pillars driving innovation that will shape the future: connectivity, cybersecurity and data. These are priority areas for accelerating the growth and development of Luxembourg’s international start-up community. We caught up with Stefan Berend, Head of Start-up Acceleration at national innovation agency Luxinnovation, to find out more. Photo par Marion Dessard Luxembourg is famous for its high levels of economic activity and its prosperous business environment. How does this benefit startups? And what role do startups play in contributing to this? Luxembourg is indeed home to a flourishing business community, characterised both by the presence of major international corporations as well as dynamic smaller companies and by the close connections and close interaction between the players. This is of course precious for start-ups that are highly dependent on their business environment – in particular for the vast majority of our around 600 start-ups that offer B2B services. Many of them testify to the ease of getting in touch with key decision-makers, even executives in large international groups that elsewhere would be very difficult to access. We are living in a data-driven world. How are Luxembourg and Luxinnovation nurturing tech developments in the data sphere? Facilitating the growth of the data economy is a national priority in Luxembourg. The government has developed a strategy for data-driven innovation as a driver of economic growth. The objective is to make Luxembourg the place where companies can develop and test their data-based solutions in a safe and secure environment with access to world-class technology. Luxembourg stands out for its comprehensive, supportive data ecosystem that provides a solid foundation for the country to become Europe’s most trusted data hub. It includes all the most central components, such as a national cybersecurity centre, data lakes, specialised research centres and world-class infrastructure, including the highest concentration of tier IV data centres in Europe and ultra-low-latency connections to Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London and Paris. All of this is obviously available for companies located here, including start-ups. The ecosystem is being further boosted by the business-oriented high-performance computer MeluXina. While most supercomputers are pure research structures, MeluXina offers 65% of its capacity to companies, including start-ups. As the next step, the country is working on the development of a national cloud and a secure data exchange platform. What makes Luxembourg such a great data hub for internationalisation? For a start-up, the internationalisation phase is essential. It is also very complex and difficult. Knowledge of the markets in which it is going to operate, openness to the environment around it, access to potential customers who are already operating internationally, and the creation of an international team are all key. Luxembourg is one of the world’s most global economies, renowned for its strong international ties and openness to cross-border business. Nearly half of the country’s population is made up of foreign nationals, which makes it the most international country in the EU, and around 50% of its working population are cross-border commuters. French and German are official languages alongside Luxembourgish, and English is widely spoken. This creates perfect conditions for building an international team and entering new markets. All of this means that companies located here start thinking about their international expansion from day one. How can international companies start operating from Luxembourg? What’s the process? The StartupLuxembourg.com website is an excellent gateway to our ecosystem. Startups can find online on they need about the players in the ecosystem – incubators, accelerators and institutional bodies – as well as practical information on topics such as how to create a company. For those who want more detailed guidance regarding the administrative steps to take, the House of Entrepreneurship is there to help them. The portal also has a blog that keeps you up to date with the various networking events that are taking place. There are many of them! I would advise any startup that wants to know more about our country as a base for the start of its international expansion to browse the site and use the facilities available to ask all their questions. The requests are redirected to the players who are best able to answer them, notably my team that coaches companies in optimising their business models and help them identify and apply for suitable funding instruments. That’s how the first link is made. Data-driven innovation is a priority in Luxembourg. The country welcomes companies wishing to develop, test and geo-localise digital solutions and develop their compliance in a safe, secure European environment with access to world-class technology."
2022.7.19,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/huelva-based-seabery-gets-a-boost-for-its-sustainable-edtech-solution-for-industry-workers/,"Bringing augmented reality to industry, Seabery is a Spanish company training and educating industrial workers to make the sector more efficient and attractive to new talent. It’s just picked up fresh funding to continue the development of its globally utilised edtech solutions. Operating at the intersection of industry, edtech and augmented reality, Seabery is pushing forward the use of cutting-edge tech in the industrial sector. The company has just received fresh investment to boost its sustainable approach to education and training that is helping to reduce carbon emissions and attract skilled workers. This comes as Spain Oman Private Equity Fund (SOPEF) and Seaya Andromeda have today announced their entry as minority partners in Seabery. Seabery’s Proposition  Founded in Huelva in 2007 by Basilio Marquínez, Seabery pivoted to its current edtech approach in 2010, designing and patenting Soldamatic – a pioneering training solution in welding using AI. The industrial sector has been hit particularly hard by a talent shortage and the resulting lack of skilled workers has left the sector with a desperate need to rethink approaches to attracting workers. This is what Seabery and the Soldamatic product are helping to achieve. Through a multi-sensory training interface –which includes sight, sound and touch thanks to high-precision parameterized software– Soldamatic is the closest simulation to the real process of welding. It enables future welders to pick up the necessary skills before getting certified, avoids the unnecessary consumption of f resources such as energy, gas and metal, and, reduces waste. It is, therefore, an environmentally sustainable choice building an essential workforce. Seabery’s founder and partner, Basilio Marquínez, commented: “Seabery was founded to promote modern, efficient, interactive and sustainable training for new generations. Our technology democratizes access to training and solves the global shortage of qualified workers. I am proud of the path we have taken, of the team that has made it possible, and I am excited about the future of the company.” Since the beginning of its commercialization in 2012, Soldamatic has facilitated access to quality training, providing a big boost to what is an essential industry. It was reported that Solamatic can shorten learning time by more than 50%. Further reporting that Soldamatic reduces the materials and consumables used during the training of welders by over 70%, the product brings many benefits to the sector. To put this in perspective – the 70% reduction in material and consumables is a saving equivalent to the materials needed to build the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Its implementation in training centres has also drastically reduced the number of occupational accidents. Pedro Marquínez, CEO and partner of Seabery, said: “I am delighted to welcome SOPEF and Seaya Andromeda, two benchmark funds in the industry. As a global leader in EdTech, I am proud of what we have achieved through our proprietary and patented technology, Soldamatic, to revolutionize welding training. But we are only scratching the surface of Seabery’s potential. Together with our new investment partners and Seabery’s exceptionally talented technology team, we will continue to expand our portfolio and skills-based learning solutions.” The Spanish company now has more than 100 employees around the world with the Soldamatic solution operable in more than 80 countries, the US and Germany being key markets. It’s also used by some of the world’s leading industrial companies such as Siemens, Mercedes Benz, Audi, Volkswagen, John Deere and Alstom. What’s next With this new investment from SOPEF and Seaya Andromeda, Seabery plans to accelerate its expansion into the APAC region. It will also increase the commercialization of its cutting-edge tech among industrial companies and continue developing its technology with the aim of opening new business lines. Sectors like industrial paint training are in the pipeline – diversifying the firms offering and contribution to the industry. Luis Parras, partner at SOPEF, commented: “Seabery is a leading technology company that has improved the training and education process of welders, one of the most demanded professions in the industrial context. Its high growth in the USA and Germany is replicable in other countries and, additionally, in the industrial sector, where it can generate high cost savings for companies where the welding process is critical. At SOPEF, we are delighted to be able to support, together with Seaya Andromeda, Seabery and its founders in the next phase of their international expansion.” Pablo Pedrejón, partner at Seaya Andromeda added: “Under the leadership of Basilio and Pedro, Seabery has positioned itself as one of the global leaders in Augmented Reality, with a direct impact on future welders and the industrial sector. From this leadership position, the founders have a clear vision of how to take the company to the next level. At Seaya Andromeda, and together with SOPEF, we are very excited to be able to accompany them on that path.”"

2022.7.19,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/italian-proptech-startup-casavo-takes-home-e400-million-as-it-shakes-up-europes-property-market/,"Milan-based startup Casavo has just scooped up €400 million in an immense Series D funding round, showing that proptech is still growing despite economic concerns growing across Europe. The proptech startup is now planning its French expansion. Since 2017, Casavo has been influencing the property market in Southern Europe. Founded by Giorgio Tinacci, the property platform redesigns the way the property market operates, using a distinct and innovative business model. Now, the company has just secured €400 million in a Series D funding round. This comes little more than a year after a €200 million Series Craise which already marked the company as one of Europe’s fastest-growing proptechs. The funding A €100 million equity portion was led by Exor, whilst the additional €300 million was led by Intesa Sanpaolo and Viola Credit. Additional investors include Neva SGR (Intesa Sanpaolo Group), Endeavor Catalyst, Hambro Perks, Fuse Venture Partners, as well as angel investor Sébastien de Lafond. Existing investors, Greenoaks, Project A Ventures, 360 Capital, P101 SGR, Picus Capital, and Bonsai Partners also participated in this round. Reimagining the property market Casavo takes a unique look at the property market – and it’s clearly on to something. It offers free appraisals to sellers, generates a quick offer, buys it and then renovates it to sell at a profit. Flipping houses in Southern Europe, the startup has gained traction in its native Italy, and Spain and expanded to Portugal this year. In this part of the continent, the model works well, there are many properties available that have massive potential but are sitting either derelict and/or haven’t changed hands for decades and are in need of some refurbishment. Using its technological platform – ‘Instant Buyer’ – Casavo is fundamentally changing how people sell and buy homes in Europe. It uses a dynamic pricing model to evaluate the financial potential of each home, calculating what the value will be post-refurbishment based on data it has on similar properties. It’s reported that the startup grew its user base 3x in 2021 and the company has handled €1 billion worth of transactions. Founder and CEO Tinacci said: “This combination of equity and debt is a recognition of our relentless focus on sustainable growth and confidence in our long-term vision. The round will allow us to consolidate our leadership in Europe by growing across our existing markets in Italy, Spain and Portugal, while expanding into new ones, with France being a priority. We’ll continue investing in our mission to simplify the way people sell and buy homes, having evolved from a pure home-buying platform to a leading next-generation European residential marketplace.” What’s next While the property market might have been slow to digitise compared to other sectors, there is plenty of space for fresh innovation in the sector. Property investment continues to be one of the most popular investment areas, and so, platforms like Casavo have a real market potential to continue growing, despite wider economic concerns. The startup has already proven itself in its space – holding a high value of the market share in Italy and Spain and growing fast in Portugal. Now, with his new finding, the startup is planning its move to France – where there is undoubtedly big market potential. Alongside moving into France’s lucrative market, Casavo plans to add an additional 200 people to its team of 400 in the next year. In addition, the firm wants to continue product development, so it can become an all-in-one property provider, with the capability to offer mortgages and so on. Already Casavo is a mortgage broker in Italy, and they want to expand on this offering across core markets and add further features. Exor Seeds’ Noam Ohana, commented: “Casavo is becoming the clear European PropTech leader and we are excited to continue the journey with Giorgio. Despite turbulent market conditions, the team has executed extremely well to date and we are optimistic about the future.”"
2022.7.19,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/amsterdam-based-sympower-secures-e22-million-to-fuel-europes-energy-transition/,"Green tech startup Sympower has just raised €22 million for its proprietary software platform that is accelerating the transition to net-zero. The Amsterdam-based company doubled its customer base last year and reported a 3x revenue increase. Achieving a more flexible, independent and sustainable energy system is a key European priority at the moment. Achieving carbon neutrality is an ambitious task, but we are icnreasingly being reminded and made all the more aware of the importance of getting there. Now more than ever before, in the wake of record-breaking summer temperatures and rising living costs, it’s clear that Europe needs to think sustainable when it comes to energy. Sympower: Accelerating net zero ambitions Amsterdam-based Sympower wants to accelerate the transition to net-zero, helping to build smarter and cleaner renewable energy systems. The startup just raised €22 million to fuel its mission. The funding was led by Silicon Valley-based Activate Capital, a leading VC and growth equity firm serving climate and sustainability pioneers in energy, mobility, and industrials. Together with Activate Capital, the consortium of VC firms include Expon Capital as well as previous investors Rubio Impact Ventures, PDENH and Rockstart. In order to mitigate the climate crisis whilst ensuring energy independence, flexibility to adapt to renewable, distributed production is key. Founded in 2015, Sympower’s proprietary software platform balances the supply and demand of electricity across international energy grids. It’s able to empower businesses, grid operators, asset owners and other energy stakeholders around the world to reduce their carbon emissions, integrate more distributed renewable energy resources, and generate new revenue streams by participating in demand-side response services. Managing Partner Anup Jacob, Activate Capital, said: “Recent events in Europe highlight the importance of energy independence in an increasingly volatile market. Sympower’s elegant software solution ties distributed energy resources into complex grid operations enabling a reliable and efficient transition of Europe’s energy infrastructure.” What’s next  The Dutch startup has now almost 100 employees spread across nine countries, including energy hubs like the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Israel. With over 750MW of flexible distributed energy sources under management across a portfolio of more than 200 industrial and commercial customers, Sympower is rapidly expanding its operations across Europe, contributing to more stable energy grids. It also became B-corp certified earlier this year, recognising its contribution to creating a cleaner energy system. This new capital injection will allow Sympower to serve more industrial and commercial customers across Europe, including demand-side loads, renewable energy production, electric vehicle charging, and battery storage facilities. Founder and CEO Simon Bushell, Sympower, said: “Given the current uncertainty in both the financial and energy markets, we are delighted to have secured further VC investment and we welcome aboard the experienced teams of Activate and Expon. The ongoing trust and support of our current investors is also invaluable as we accelerate the expansion of our services across Europe. This will help enable the transition to a clean energy system, and assist in solving short term problems during the current EU energy crisis.”"
2022.7.19,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/achieving-inclusivity-5-european-startups-serving-the-lgbtq-community/,"Across Europe, initiatives, campaigns and movements have been pushing forward a common agenda – achieving inclusivity. From greater inclusion in the boardroom to parliament buildings, all sectors in both the private and public spheres are slowly starting to reflect the beautifully diverse makeup of this continent. It’s still going slowly, but there has been some notable progress in recent years. Europe’s startup community is no different. The ecosystem has been making efforts to diversify and promote underrepresented sectors of the population in space. Further, startups are often leading the change in more progressive ways of thinking and in developing tech solutions that can harness and nurture a more inclusive Europe. One group that has historically been underrepresented, underserved, and overlooked is the LGBTQ+ community. From healthcare provision to travel safety, people identifying as part of the LGBTQ+ have systemically struggled to have their voices heard and the result is that people are not, in many cases, receiving the health care they need and deserve, face discrimination while aiming to enjoy everyday products and experiences, and in economic points-of-view, are not receiving the funding to effect change. Within Europe’s startup space, there are a number of innovators who are changing the status quo and raising the LGBTQ+ voice. Making a genuine change in the world, we wanted to highlight some fast-growing, purpose-driven startups that are showing up and serving the LGBTQ+ community every day. Freeq Founded by Sarah Massey (based in Amsterdam) and Riley Lamey in 2020, freeq is a safe tech platform serving the LGBTQ+ communities. Aiming to empower the community to enjoy a life of liberation, the platform hosts virtual events that give the chance to meet people and make connections. It was launched in the early days of the pandemic to offer LGBTQ+, sex-positive, and body-positive people a safe, fun, online events space to connect with each other – tackling the social isolation many people felt during this time. A key part of what makes freeQ special is its focus on safety online. It enables online vent producers to host safe events and then co-market them to the target audience. It’s built on a principle of collaboration, in the importance of connection. Additionally hosting LGBTQ+ cultural events on the platform, it gives audiences opportunities to connect and express themselves safely online. Jecca Blac UK-based Jecca Blac was founded by Jessica Blackler (a young entrepreneur who we think has an exciting future) to fill a gap in the cosmetics industry and make it more inclusive. The startup is developing genderless cosmetics – making the beauty sector more inclusive. After participation in the L’Oreal accelerator program, Jecca Blac has been soaring. The company has now sold more than 1.6 million products and was this year chosen by Zalando as a partner to collaborate with for Transgender Visibility Day. Cosmetics and the beauty industry have an inclusivity problem – that’s been recognized for some time now. There are few brands addressing the lack of inclusivity towards the LGBTQ+ community and bringing out products that are specifically genderless and inclusive by default, so this startup is a refreshing addition to the sector. Given the popularity and fast-paced growth, it’s clear how valuable this startup is – not only is it bringing cosmetics to the masses, but it’s making people feel seen, heard and valued. LVNDR Based out of London, LVNDR is a digital healthtech platform that is working to improve sexual wellbeing for LGBTQ+ individuals and modernises existing healthcare options. Founded in 2020, the startup is bringing a much-needed tool to a community that is far underserved in the sexual wellbeing space. Sexual wellbeing, in general, is underserved, and there generally isn’t enough openness and transparency – for the LGBTQ+ community, there is enhanced marginalisation and exclusion. LVNDR is addressing this and using a tech-first purpose-driven approach. LVNDR facilitates access to remote care and empowers users to take control of their health, giving them access to tailored services and features. In 2021, the growing team picked up €1.7 million as part of its vision to reduce social inequalities in healthcare services – starting with sexual health and gender identity care. Gendergp Founded in 2016, GenderGP is offering online, globally accessible gender-affirming healthcare and wellbeing services. In healthcare, there are many gaps. However, the lack of attention to the LGBTQ+ community has been costing lives due to discrimination. GenderGP believes that every transgender and non-binary person on the planet should have access to an on-demand healthcare ecosystem free from discrimination or prejudice. The startup has built an on-demand healthcare ecosystem for the global transgender and non-binary community. This will allow these communities to start when they’re ready, be more in control of their gender journey from the start, and no one can act as the gatekeepers of their gender identity. The company is remote-first with offices in London and Hong Kong. Babaiola Founded in 2015 in Sassari, Sardinia, Babaiola is a travel community for the LGBTQ+ community, empowering users to able to plan their next gay-friendly holidays and interact with other LGBTQ+ travellers within Europe. Users are able to find gay-friendly hotels, flights, a gay city guide, and events for the LGBTQ+ community. They can also interact with travellers via real-time chat and exchange advice and/or find travel buddies. Babaiola’s algorithm monitors and collects information every day from over 200 websites dedicated to the community. It aims to know in real-time all the relevant trends and events, aggregating all information in a single platform. The amount of data collected allows Babaiola to create a city profile that is a close match to the wishes of the user."
2022.7.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/irish-startup-valid8me-secures-e12-5-million-to-transform-customer-onboarding/,"Cork-based regtech startup Valid8me has today announced a capital injection of €12.5 million. The Irish startup has developed a SaaS platform that is transforming customer onboarding, making the processes more streamlined and secure. Launched in 2021, Valid8me is on a mission to make customer onboarding an easier process – taking away the hassle and fuss, whilst maintaining compliance to increasingly complex and convoluted compliance regulations. Today, the startup has announced a new deal with Grant Thornton Ireland that will see the company picking up a €12.5 million investment. Founded in Cork, Valid8me’s SaaS platform allows both individuals and corporations to securely store, share and manage their key Know-Your-Customer-related data. It has championed the use of reusable digital identity, which helps businesses streamline proof of identity and onboarding processes with simplicity, certainty and control. Customer onboarding has become a significant pain point for customers and businesses alike in recent years. With a lack of connectivity and shared thinking, businesses are now spending a disproportionate amount of budget and time on manually validating, updating and storing documents. Valid8me are aiming to change this. Patrick Horgan, CEO of Valid8Me explained: “The idea that consumers repeatedly share their most sensitive data, often through insecure channels, to prove their identity is archaic. Valid8Me is fundamentally different, we empower consumers to maintain a reusable digital identity that can be used universally across all industries. Our platform addresses an enormous challenge for businesses by enabling enhanced AML compliance in a radically future-proof and cost-effective way, whilst offering their clients a more secure and convenient experience” With Vali8me, customer onboarding costs are reduced by a reported 50% and onboarding time is cut by up to 90%. Digital identity vaults empower this, simplifying the task of sourcing, maintaining and updating Know-Your-Customer documents for businesses. It also reduces risk and exposure for businesses around data privacy by removing the overhead of handling sensitive data via its reusable digital identity vault model. It’s easy to get the ball rolling with the platform too – once set up with a profile, customers have a reusable identity that can be instantly verified across any business or industry. Further, as its digital, the likelihood of fraudulent documents and financial crime occurring is reduced. The platform now supports over 10,000 different document templates from 248 different countries and territories. This fresh investment will be used to increase the startup’s team size, accelerate its growth in Ireland and expansion into key markets abroad. Mick McAteer, Managing Partner of Grant Thornton Ireland said: “We view the Valid8Me platform as complementary to a number of our service lines and specifically addresses the needs of our clients across a number of sectors including financial services, legal, accounting, wealth management and real estate among others. We are excited to build our product and service offering in these sectors and bring real innovative solutions to our clients.” Steve Tennant, Head of Financial Services Advisory at Grant Thornton Ireland added: “KYC and the process by which businesses look to on-board and verify client identities is broken. We deal with an increasing number of clients who are extremely challenged by the resource overhead in complying with AML & KYC regulatory obligations. Valid8Me offers a ground-breaking approach to solving this problem and importantly optimising the customer and client experience. We use Valid8Me ourselves and have first-hand experience of how it has transformed our client onboarding processes.”"
2022.7.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/hrtech-startup-veremark-scores-e8-2-million-to-simplify-career-credentials-checks/,"London-based startup Veremark has just raised over €8.2 million – only 9 months after its initial seed round. Transforming pre-employment screening tasks, the HRtech solution is now planning to expand into new markets and further product development. Tech innovation shaping the recruitment space is continuing to churn out fresh ideas that make the entire process simpler and more efficient. And with good reason – the recruitment space has been relying on the same old processes for too long, and in the modern world and cultural shifts towards work we’ve experienced, businesses also need to reimagine hiring processes. With a pre-employment screening and career credentials check solution, Veremark is transforming how recruitment teams suss out prospective employees. The London-based startup has now raised an additional €8.2 million to fuel its mission. Daniel Callaghan, CEO of Veremark, said: “Traditional solutions in the credentials and compliance space are slow and laborious to use. This makes them ineffective. We’ve turned that logic on its head by creating a platform that’s easy to use and works for all parties.” The Funding This fresh funding was led by a new investor – US venture capital firm Stage 2 Capital. Samaipata, a Pan-European venture capital firm also joined the round as a new investor, and several existing investors Triple Point Ventures, ACF Investors, Vulpes, and SOV provided follow-on investments, bringing the company’s total funding to about €12 million. Veremark’s Approach Utilising an innovative digital platform, Veremark both simplifies the process of credential-checking for firms and enables candidates to ‘own’ their career data. Businesses can use the platform the verify the claims and credentials of candidates and prospective employees based around the world. With Veremark Career Passport, candidates themselves can store all of their career credentials in one place securely. Their credentials are stored on the blockchain in an electronic wallet, meaning candidates truly ‘own’ their data and can share it with screeners and future employers as and when required. This means that candidates no longer need to go through slow and repetitive checks every time they get a new job. To champion this cause, the firm has partnered with the leading USA recruitment trade association, Techserve Alliance, to offer Verepass. Daniel Callaghan added: “For small companies, Veremark eliminates the complexity of cross-border checks. For big companies, we provide a single platform that helps manage globally distributed workforces. For the candidate, the process is smooth, painless, and lets them own their data. With our expert investors now on board, we’re very confident about the future.” Through both direct sales and a wide number of partnerships, the company has grown monthly revenue by 300% since September 2021. Veremark’s client base of hundreds of monthly users includes HR teams at UK fintech success stories Wise and ComplyAdvantage as well as global corporates such as PepsiCo and BCG. Anubhav Maheshwari, Partner at Stage 2 Capital, said: “Effective pre-employment screening and candidate vetting are critical considerations for business operations, compliance, and risk management. Yet, around the world, these processes are highly manual and often delayed, inaccurate, or incomplete. With extensive global data connections and focus on speed and accuracy, Veremark is transforming a legacy workflow through innovation.” What’s Next Veremark now offers more than 40 kinds of credential checks across 150 countries. It’s a company that is growing fast, operating as a globally distributed team with core hubs in the UK, USA, Australia, Singapore, India, and the Philippines. Over the next 12 months, the team headcount is expected to double. With the pre-employment screening market reported to be at over €15.5 billion annually and changing work cultures necessitating more oversight on a global level of career crede3ntials, Veremark has massive market potential. This new capital injection will be put towards expanding in key markets around the world, as well as continued development of the platform. Jose del Barrio, Founding Partner at Samaipata said: “We are very excited to be part of Veremark’s round on their mission to become the most global platform for pre-employment checks and first-ever career passport. As the way we work is increasingly flexible and remote across the world, we believe that the Veremark team, with their extensive experience in recruitment, tech and design, are well equipped to empower that change and make it happen.”"

2022.7.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/berlin-based-charles-picks-up-e19-5-million-to-bring-conversational-commerce-to-europe/,"German startup Charles is bringing something new to Europe – conversational commerce (cCommerce). The Berlin-based company has just bagged €19.5 million for its platform as part of its plans to harness the power of chat apps in the commerce space. Ecommerce has been a booming industry for Europe in the past couple of years and we’ve seen plenty of fresh innovation that is keeping the market spinning. Today, though, something pretty unique has caught our attention – conversational commerce. Berlin-based startup Charles is unlocking this new SaaS solution in Europe and has just picked up €19.5 million to do so. The Funding This Series A round was led by Salesforce Ventures. Accel and HV Capital, who led the company’s seed round in 2021, also participated in the round. Introducing Charles Founded in 2020 by Andreas Tussing and Artjem Weissbeck, Charles enables merchants to provide conversational marketing and commerce experiences via chat apps. Essentially, the conversational-first operating system brings the full ecommerce process into the likes of WhatsApp, bringing consumers and companies closer together. With the platform, businesses can sell products, send newsletters and support customers via chat – personalising consumer experience. It works by seamlessly connecting chat app APIs like WhatsApp with systems like Salesforce and Shopify. Artjem Weissbeck, co-founder and co-CEO at Charles, explained: “Since day one, our mission has been to make commerce more personal by bringing it into our most human habit: conversations. Rich messaging apps, like WhatsApp, have been proven to facilitate this in Latin America and Asia by combining sales, marketing and service in one ongoing conversation. This is something ecommerce has failed to do due to the forced marriage of web shops and email. Conversational commerce is now sweeping over Europe and there’s never been a better way for brands to wow their customers.” Charles was launched as a solution to a problem the two founders had personally experienced. Back in 2019, Artjem Weissbeck and Andreas Tussing initially launched a WhatsApp-first clothing brand. While customers loved the seamless and personal experience, Tussing and Weissbeck could not find any software that combined service, sales and newsletter functionalities for chat apps in a single place. Consequently, they decided to pivot their business and build a true category creating software in the field of “cCommerce”. Fresh Approaches Conversational commerce has picked up traction in markets such as Asia and Latam (where it’s reported about 50% of consumers purchase via chat apps), but it’s still a pretty new concept here in Europe. It certainly has big market potential and it’s an interesting new development for the ecommerce world. Brining more personalisation to shopping experiences is known to boost business success and customer fulfilment. The Berlin-born platform has already reported healthy signs for the future. According to the team, several of its 100+ customers have hit 7-digit WhatsApp revenues in 2022 and the platform has also been driving 10-40% of their sales via chat. In addition, clients have had more than 90% opening rates and 8x more revenue per recipient via WhatsApp newsletters than via email. In times of economic uncertainty, these figures show strong market potential and Charles has been building up a new, fast-growing revenue channel. Nowi Kallen, Managing Director at Salesforce Ventures, said: “Charles is a true category creator. Artjem and Andreas are on a mission to drive better experiences for consumers and better outcomes for merchants resulting in higher engagement, higher sales and lower customer acquisition costs. Customers rave about Charles’ capabilities and service so we could not be more excited to partner with the Charles team.” What’s Next This fresh funding is a massive boost to the company’s ambition to become the leading conversational commerce platform for brands and enterprises across Europe. It has already picked up traction, with many brands showing interest in joining the conversational commerce trend. The funding will be used to expand operations from Germany into key European markets and to target larger enterprise clients. Andreas Tussing, co-founder and co-CEO at Charles, added: “In the last two years, we’ve been writing playbooks for cCommerce in Europe with some incredibly innovative brands. On the way, Charles has matured to become a true suite that’s now ready for enterprise clients. We see cCommerce becoming a secret weapon for many brands in times where they must go the extra mile to win new customers and nurture existing ones. With Salesforce Ventures, we’ve found the perfect partner to unlock this potential in the years to come and are honored to welcome them alongside our existing investors Accel and HV Capital.”"
2022.7.20,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/10-ways-startups-can-keep-employees-happy-and-motivated/,"Most startups are launched with the aim to become a well-known company, make a difference in the world, and build a good reputation. Yet, the simple truth is that growing a startup into something big and valuable is not an easy process – it takes a lot of hustle, hard work and determination. It takes resilience and the ability to adapt and overcome hard times. The fuel that keeps the startup wheels turning is the motivation and the passion behind the project. Founders are more likely to keep going through the good and the bad. But how do you keep your employees happy and motivated on this rollercoaster journey? It definitely takes some preparation, but the good news is – it is possible! Let’s explore some things you could start doing tomorrow to make your people happier and motivated to work and achieve things. There are three things that make us happy on a basic emotional level:  the feeling of belonging, being able to make a difference, recognition for the difference we make.  So here are our suggestions on how you could build on these foundations: The feeling of belonging Building on the team spirit  Creative licence abounds here. We’d recommend starting with weekly or bi-weekly all-employee meetings/calls where you could discuss important news, introduce new people, and where teams could showcase some new features they developed. Another idea is having regular group breakfasts/ lunches. Team buildings are actually one more great way for people to connect if properly planned. Regular one-on-one meetings And we mean not only with an employee’s manager but with their manager’s manager or the founders (depending on the size of your team). Being able to talk about some professional matters, career development, or simply share life stories with someone who is the manager of your manager is very motivating. But you and your top managers have to be ready to listen and talk! Company stock Set up a policy of allocating stock options to employees. Make your people feel that they are in to share your common success. The cliff and vesting period terms will help you make sure there aren’t incentives for someone to wait just to get the stock and leave the party early. Being able to make a difference Support the initiatives and delegate responsibility Let your people own the processes/projects within your company if they feel that they’d like to. Faster professional growth, personal motivation – probably something you can’t have too much of. Being recognized for the difference you make A clear process for professional growth Even though sometimes these lines get blurry at startups, when your employee count hits 20, it’s about time you have a clear policy for career growth. It should not be complicated, but it definitely should seem fair to your people and provide them with milestones to achieve. Showcasing the results  It often happens that functional teams have limited knowledge of what all the other people at your company do, which sometimes leaves them wondering. So if you have already set up the all-company meetings, your people could use some time for demos. Alternatively, there could be separate knowledge-sharing sessions. Praising the achievements Don’t forget to recognize and praise both individual and team achievements. It does have a multiplication effect. Now, to a few additional tips we think you should take note of. It’s not possible to stay happy and motivated and generate new ideas (creative solutions) when you don’t know what you’re trying to achieve and/or are simply burned out. Prioritise wellbeing Take some time to plan and set smart goals You could experiment with the Google OKR (Objectives and Key Results) approach here, if you haven’t yet. It takes some time and practice, as both no goals and over-ambitious goals could be detrimental to your people’s motivation. Yet, getting from point A to point B it’s much more satisfying if you know what point B is. Overtime should not be a norm Sure, there are certain cases where you all really need to work these long hours. Deadlines for your product release, a big deployment scheduled for late hours, or an important pitch to make in two days from now – you all will definitely have to take care of it. But on most business days (let alone weekends), there really is no need for everyone to work late. Being able to rest and recover from one work day to another is essential in keeping yourself and your employees mentally and physically healthy and avoiding burnout. Vacations are mandatory Yes, even for the founders. You need to take your mind off things for a period of time of at least 7 consecutive days (ideally – two weeks) per 6-9 months for your mind to be able to take on a fresh perspective. And, trust us, you will be amazed by what new ideas you will come up with. You and your people. What else? You might be wondering where’s the point about financial motivation on this list. And you are not mistaken – it’s simply not there. Not to dive deep into scientific research (but you could if you’d like to), money can only be a valid point of leverage for two causes:  Luring people into your company, initially. Avoiding losing your best employees only because you pay them half of the average market salary offerings.  But it’s not really about work motivation, is it? Fortunately (or not?), long-term motivation isn’t something you can buy. So, are you ready to try some things from the list? Or maybe you already have. Please, let us know how it is going – we’d love to hear about your experience."

Are you interested to learn about the EU funding potential for your company? The EU is running several large funding programmes, headlined by Horizon Europe, a €95.5 billion programme for research and innovation. Horizon Europe tackles climate change, supports the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and boosts the EU’s competitiveness and growth. The programme facilitates collaboration and strengthens the impact of research and innovation in developing, supporting and implementing EU policies while tackling global challenges. The flagship innovation programme within Horizon Europe to identify, develop and scale up breakthrough technologies and game-changing innovations is the European Innovation Council (EIC). It has a budget of around €10 billion to support groundbreaking innovations throughout the lifecycle from early-stage research to proof of concept, technology transfer, demonstration & validation, and the financing and scale-up of startups and SMEs. There are three funding mechanisms within the EIC:  Pathfinder – supports the exploration of bold ideas for radically new technologies (TRL 1-4). It welcomes the high-risk / high gain and interdisciplinary cutting-edge science collaborations that underpin technological breakthroughs. Transition – funds innovation activities that go beyond the experimental proof of principle in laboratory to support both the maturation and validation of your novel technology in the lab and in relevant application environments, and the development of a business case/model towards the innovation’s future commercialisation (TRL 4-6). Accelerator – supports individual Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), in particular deep-tech startups and spinout companies to develop and scale up trailblazing innovations (TRL 5-9).

2022.7.21,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/czech-startup-better-stack-bags-e18-2-million-to-help-build-a-better-internet/,"Building an improved observability stack for developers, Better Stack has just raised over €18.2 million. The Czech startup’s product leverages the advances of the ClickHouse database and brings enhanced collaboration. While we are undoubtedly living in a digitally-driven world, developers are increasingly in demand to keep the software that is fuelling innovation running optimally. However, there are some considerable challenges they still have to contend with. Namely, that software reliability is still unsolved – as shown by major outages of companies like Atlassian and Cloudflare earlier this year. Better Stack is on a mission to address, helping developers to build a better internet. The startup has just raised €18.2 million to fuel its mission in a Series A funding round. Creandum led the round, with Carl Fritjofsson joining the board. Susa Ventures, K5 Global, Credo Ventures, Kaya, Lachy Groom, Ryan Petersen (founder of Flexport), Michael Stoppelman (SVP of Engineering of Yelp), Emil Eifrem (founder of Neo4j), Zach Sims (founder of Codecademy), Madhu Muthukumar (CPO at Notion) and others also joined. ClickHouse-based challenger Founded in 2021, the Czech-based startup is aiming to empower developers with a disruptive observability stack, that brings Figma-like collaboration to developers and leverages the advances of the ClickHouse database. The aim is that the tool will make it easier to ship better and more reliable software faster. Today, developers are still relying on a multitude of tools that need integrating, are costly, are complicated to use, and, feel a little old in a constantly changing and evolving software landscape. Better Stack’s solution combines monitoring, logging, incident management, status pages, and more into a single platform – making it a developer’s dream come true. Juraj Masar, Better Stack CEO and co-founder commented: “We lived the daily struggles engineers go through at our previous jobs and with Better Stack we decided to solve at least some of them. We are simply engineers making the tools we always wanted to use.” The product is reported to be about 10x cheaper yet 10-100x faster than alternatives. Customers are also able to keep data in hot storage for longer, thanks to the ClickHouse database, and, it leverages SQL for data querying so is more intuitive to use. Further, adopting Figma-like collaboration allows developers to work together in real-time. Veronika Kolejak, Better Stack COO and co-founder said: “Take 10 engineers off the street and ask them: are you fluent in Datadog Query Language, New Relic Query Language, AWS CloudWatch Query Language, PromQL, LogQL… and 9 out of 10 will say no. But every engineer knows SQL, which is why with Better Stack, we’re making it the querying standard for software observability. And this is just one of the decisions we made that makes us ‘just work’ for so many engineers.” Tomas Hromada, Better Stack CTO added: “For us, developer tools don’t mean they can’t be beautifully designed or a joy to use. We think that all users, whether they are indie hackers or CTOs of large corporations, deserve a great experience. Developers do care about working with tools that focus on design and UX as much as they focus on functionality.” Next steps Since its launch in 2021, Better Stack is now used by over 70k developers and over 1,400 customers. eams from enterprises including ESET, Decathlon, Time.com, and Accenture; startups like Brave and Drata and indie hackers such as Plausible or Buy me a coffee already rely on the platform. The Series A investment will support Better Stack’s continued growth and allow it to scale the product at a faster pace to help more developers around the world. Carl Fritjofsson, General Partner at Creandum said: “At Creandum, we deeply care about product experiences, and Better Stack not only redefined what beautiful and intuitive observability products look like, but ultimately Better Stack customers will be empowered to build better products themselves. With 10x lower cost and 10x better performance we are convinced that Better Stack will become an important part of software infrastructure.”"

2022.7.21,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/estonian-startup-solarstone-secures-e10-million-to-expand-its-green-energy-solutions/,"Solarstone, a green tech startup from Estonia, has just secured €10 million in a fresh funding boost. The startup is developing solar solutions that can help generate a shift in energy generation and usage. As Europeans increasingly turn to renewable and greener energy sources, harnessing the power of the sun is one sustainable way to fuel the continent. Whilst many people and businesses are adding solar panels to existing builds, Solarstone wants to encourage the use of solar from the very beginning. The Estonian startup has developed building-integrated solar solutions and wants to become the standard in residential and infrastructure construction. To fuel the mission, Solarstone has announced the raise of €10 million in a round led by Biofuel OÜ – the asset management company focusing on environmentally friendly wood refining, and sustainable forest management, with a clear focus on sustainable energy management and production. This is Solarstone OÜ’s second significant funding round. Sunly, one of the leading renewable energy companies in the Baltics, joined the company in 2019. Solar-integrated construction Founded in 2015 and based in Viljandi, Estonia, Solarstone’s approach to construction is one that prioritises sustainability and promotes a new approach to how energy is generated in European households. Energy production and consumption are undergoing a major shift across the continent at the memento, with prosumer-generated capacities balancing the shortcomings of centralized energy generation. It’s meant that many are starting to look at how they can generate more energy more efficiently where they live – a key part of what inspired the creation of Solarstone. The CEO and co-founder, Silver Aednik, identified that this cultural and behavioural shift towards energy is being facilitated by Solarstone: “Solarstone’s technology removes all barriers to making it happen as it makes it profitable, beautiful & climate conscious of adding solar directly to where they live.” This fresh funding boost follows the startup’s 7000th solar roof installation in 8 countries. It will enable the company to upgrade production and develop the teams in Estonia as well as other strategic markets. In addition, Solarstone is investing in software solutions that empower stakeholders in the construction industry to design and procure solar power plants more effectively. Silver Aednik commented: “Existing BIM models already facilitate the work of architects and engineers. Soon, implementation of modern satellite technology and an all-inclusive ecosystem platform will provide simple tools to design and deliver the most suitable integrated solar plant for all market players.” Biofuel’s CEO Andreas Laane, added: “Solarstone stands out from other solar solution providers with smart technology, which helps avoid unnecessary material and production costs in creating modern roofs. Innovative software and a proprietary hardware component provide a good impetus for the green revolution.”"
2022.7.21,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/fintech-startup-atlantic-money-scores-e2-9-million-to-launch-its-money-transfer-service/,"London-based Atlantic Money has just secured an additional €2.9 million as it launches its money transfer service and plans international expansion. The fintech startup aims to make international transfers frictionless. Making international transfers of money just got a whole lot easier. On a mission to bring equality to the market, fintech firm Atlantic Money has just announced that its low-cost transfer service is now available to everyone in the UK, with plans to open up to EU residents in the coming months. This launch comes as the firm picks up an additional €2.9 million Seed funding, led by Amplo. Nordstar also participated alongside former Lazada executive, Martell Hardenberg. Previous investors include Index Ventures, Ribbit & Kleiner Perkins. It brings the total raised to €7.4 million. The Aim Atlantic Money was founded in 2021 by Neeraj Baid and Patrick Kavanagh to create a simple, slick and cost-effective way to move money across borders. Now available to everyone in the UK, the firm claim to be saving users up to 99% on cross-border payment costs – and it’s just received its EU licence to offer the service across the continent. The fintech startup was created when the founders discovered that big institutions are able to move unlimited money around the world at effectively zero cost, securing the live exchange rate by working directly with one another. However, retail customers have not enjoyed this luxury. Retail customers are being charged heavy fees to transfer money internationally, and the cost is largely fixed per transaction. It means that those who have family or financial commitments abroad, such as mortgages, credit cards, investments, tuition fees and so on, are being charged unfairly. This is what Atlantic Money aim to change – democratising the process of transferring money abroad. Patrick Kavanagh, Co-Founder of Atlantic Money, explained: “The previous generation of challengers like Revolut and Wise disrupted the banks, bringing better technology and lower fees. But they have since lost focus and abandoned the very product that made them great in a quest to build the next ‘super app’. We are disassembling this approach by being laser-focused on doing one thing better than anyone else – getting people’s money from one currency and country to another, as efficiently as possible.” The Tech  Offering an app alongside a tech-led platform, Atlantic Money cuts out the middleman and directly connects everyday customers to an institutional-grade currency transfer solution. It means that pricing previously reserved for banks will be available to everyone – truly transforming the existing status quo. With Atlantic Money, there is a fixed flat fee of just £3, undercutting incumbent money transfer providers and giving users big savings compared to competitors in the market. Users of the app go through a one-minute verification process, and can immediately begin transferring money. They can select standard delivery or opt for express delivery for a small additional fee of 0.05%. Neeraj Baid, Co-Founder of Atlantic Money, said: “Large financial institutions move unlimited money around the world at effectively zero cost and secure the live exchange rate by working directly with one another. Meanwhile, retail customers are charged progressive fees and unjustifiable exchange rates. We are democratizing pricing previously reserved for the banks and drastically cutting the cost of larger transfers by up to 99% lower than all other money transfer companies.” Customers can send money from the UK in GBP into 9 currencies including USD, EUR, AUD, CAD, SEK, NOK, DKK, PLN and CZK, with new currency corridors and advanced product features being added continuously post-launch. Neeraj Baid: “We are already seeing some fascinating use cases and delivering substantial cost savings for our customers. For example, a customer recently purchased a property in mainland Europe and sent the equivalent of €200,000 from the UK – they saved 98% compared to Wise.” What’s next Now the firm has gone live in the UK, it is also planning to supercharge international expansion with this fresh capital boost. Already having obtained an EU licence, the service will be available to EU residents in the coming months. Atlantic Money Ltd is authorised and regulated as a payment institution (FRN: 947491) by the Financial Conduct Authority in England and Wales (13057810), and Atlantic Money NV is authorised and regulated as a payment institution by the National Bank of Belgium (0783.476.423). Patrick Kavanagh added: “We are grateful to our current and new investors for their continued support and excited to provide our UK customers with a best-in-class customer experience and unmatched cost savings.”"

The proptech is digitising the rental experience, making it more apt for the modern world and economically efficient. With rising costs and growing cities, the rental market across Europe is growing increasingly competitive. While the amount of renters is continuing to grow and the market becoming increasingly cut-throat, there has been a need for an innovative solution that can support renters as much as landlords. Enter Residently – the proptech startup shaking up the game that has just secured €5.2 million. The Funding The UK-based startup has just secured more than €5.2 million in its latest funding round. Contributions came from Love Ventures, alongside existing investors Felix Capital, LocalGlobe and A/O PropTech as well as a Seedrs crowdfund. Residently: Renting super-app Founded in 2017 by Tom Allason, Residently is on a mission to digitise the rental experience, bringing renting into the modern age. The platform operates like a rental marketplace that develops trusted relationships with renters, and it’s claimed it can make big savings. The Residently app lets renters arrange viewings, take virtual tours, make offers, secure their home, pay deposits and extend or renew their lease all within one app. Broadband and other utilities can be set up in advance along with helpful services like moving, storage, furniture rental, cleaning and digital locks. For any renter, this makes life a whole lot easier and takes away any anxiety renters may have as they can trust that any issues they may have can be resolved simply. Further, for the agents and property managers, there are benefits too. Digitising the renter’s experiences enables property managers to streamline their operations – saving them around €450 per property per year, whilst also doubling their landlord’s Net Operating Income through void reduction. Residenty’s vision is for a marketplace where homes can be secured months in advance with flexible leases, renter reviews and communications with prior tenants. Tom Allason, Founder at Residently explained: “In a world where we can secure a taxi, takeaway or trip away in seconds it is nuts that we tolerate friction and uncertainty where we spend most of our time and money. We’re here to transform the experience and economics of renting. We started by digitising the rental journey, next up is solving the greatest problem with renting. Letting renters secure their next home more than a month in advance will eliminate unnecessary stress and double rent for them and costly voids for landlords.” The market It’s reported that in the UK there are over 5 million rental homes – and this can only be expected to grow. Across Europe, renting is still the popular way ti have a place to live. It’s generally more accessible to people and for younger generations and young professionals, it’s a standard way of living. But for this digital-native generation, renting has stayed in the past. Renters have had difficulties communicating with their property managers, and there’s a general feeling of discontent with the market. Rising costs and a lack of trust are two of the main problems. Residently is bringing a digital approach to tackle this – streamlining operations for both owners and renters, reducing costs and delays throughout the whole rental experience. Adrian Love, Partner at Love Ventures commented: “There’s a gap in the market for a property platform that radically transforms renting, that’s also truly aligned with both renters and landlords. Tom and his team have the ambition and understanding to re-shape the customer experience for renters in ways that are long overdue. We’re excited to be working with Residently to help fund their global expansion and create a world leading home brand.”"

The Berlin-based startup has just picked up €6.4 million to boost its global reach. Reportedly accounting for 80% of the total global workforce, the deskless workforce is growing rapidly. Traditionally, deskless workers have been those working in sectors like education, health, hospitality, transportation and so on – those who are on ‘the front lines’ of society, creating, selling and delivering the products, services and activities we enjoy. The deskless workforce is a massive cohort and it’s not one that’s easy to manage. Berlin-based Lumiform has developed a mobile and desktop app that aims to make it simpler. It digitizes and automates the workflows of deskless teams across all kids of sectors and industries right around the world. Funding The startup has announced the close of its Series A funding at €6.4 million. Capnamic led the round, joining 42CAP which led the Seed round, EquityPitcher Ventures, Westtech Ventures, and Exxeta AG along with well-known Business Angels such as Christoph Gerber, Kai Hansen – founders of Lieferando, Christian Henschel, Paul Müller – founders of Adjust, Christophe Folschette, Thibaut Britz – founders of Talkwalker, and Stefan Tietze – founder of gebraucht.de The Platform Founded in 2019 by brothers Philip Roelen-Blasberg and Lukas Roelen-Blasberg, Lumiform is the easy-to-use SaaS solution helping organizations digitalize and automate the workflows of their deskless workforce. It means that teams of all sizes, working in all sorts of locations, can work efficiently together and spend less time on antiquated and burdensome paper-based processes. The deskless workforce tends to occupy roles that are the driving force of society – delivering goods, treating us when we are sick, and catering to our needs and wants. It, therefore, needs operations to run at a high standard, to be efficient in order to keep society ticking forward. With Lumiform, workflows are digitised and automated – making everything smoother and simpler. This includes vital processes such as occupational safety checks on construction sites, hygiene documentation in restaurants, or vehicle inspections in logistics companies. Lukas Blasberg, co-founder and co-CEO, explained: “Most software is developed thinking about the desktop worker, even though 80% of all employees worldwide are deskless workers, who still need to heavily rely on pen and paper due to the lack of specific technology or application that suits their needs. These analog processes are time-consuming and error-prone, resulting in high costs as well as quality losses, operational mistakes, etc. With Lumiform, we are making it easy for deskless teams to switch to a digital solution that gives them real-time insights from the field to make efficient data-driven decisions.” Flexible Solutions Users can create custom forms with a flexible form builder or kickstart digitization efforts by using over 12,000 ready-made templates that are provided for free. Teams can then fill out the digital forms – online or offline – via the mobile app or desktop (whatever is most convenient at a given time). If a problem is found, corrective actions are automatically or manually assigned to the responsible person. Teams can then monitor and collaborate on troubleshooting issues and solve them 4 times faster. After submitting forms, Lumiform automatically creates professional and customizable reports, which can be shared immediately with all stakeholders. Real-time data from the field and in-depth analysis help managers act quickly and focus on areas that need improvement. What makes Lumiform stand out is its automation capabilities. Companies can pre-define “if – then” logic, automate corrective action workflows and reporting as well as set up advanced notification reminders to just name a few of the features available. Olaf Jacobi, Managing Partner at Capnamic said: “The largest contributor and backbone of the world economy is the deskless worker, yet to date, this group has remained largely untouched by the recent waves of digitalization. Lumiform provides an easy-to-use, yet a smart solution, that can be adopted in various industries and at companies of all sizes, digitalizing mundane data capturing tasks like inspections and audits, making them trackable whilst providing a simple task distribution and management system. In the future, we see Lumiform increasing its value proposition and product layer toward an operating system to become a major driver of innovation and digitalization.” The Plans Already over 30k organisations across 188 different countries have submitted over 1.5 million forms by trusting Lumiform to help their business. This new capital injection will be used towards boosting product development and expanding the startup’s global marketing efforts. Philip Blasberg, co-founder and co-CEO, added: “We are proud to have achieved big milestones in the past 18 months. None of this would have been possible without our 32 highly talented and motivated team members. We are incredibly happy to receive the trust of our existing investors and are proud to have Capnamic on board as a lead investor, an undisputed expert in B2B SaaS startups. Together we are working on our mission to become the world’s leading deskless worker OS.”"

The Lisbon-based company has developed a SaaS platform to revolutionise how sports and entertainment brands manage media assets. Having just closed its second pre-seed round with an additional €500k, ScorePlay has now scored more than €1 million in funding – also reporting a 30% MoM growth in revenue over the past 6 months. The Funding The first close was made up of several notable angel investors, including Nicolas Julia (CEO of Sorare), David Apple (ex-Notion & Typeform) and Omar DaFonseca (ex-Soccer player, BeIn Commentator), alongside Kima Ventures VC fund. This second pre-seed round sees Mario Götze (business angel/ World Cup Winner and current player – formerly of Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund and now of Eintracht Frankfurt) take to the pitch as well as Another.vc. Engaging Fans After leaving Europe to travel to New York, co-founders Victorien Tixier and Xavier Green lost their connection to their favourite hometown football clubs and realised that teams didn’t have the right tools to engage their fans online. In the digital age, this is something vitally important to maintaining strong connections and encouraging the next generation of sports fans. Having already launched another company in the media space, they decided to focus on giving sports organisations the platform to focus on content creation and engaging their fans. From that idea, ScorePlay was born. Founded in 2020, ScorePlay is an AI-powered media asset manager for sports organisations, that centralises, classifies and then distributes all their photos and videos automatically, giving them the time to focus on creation. The Platform The ScorePlay platform gives brands a dedicated space to centralise media assets together, the assets can then be classified via an integrated AI tagging system, before being distributed to identified athletes/ artists and sponsors automatically through the ScorePlay mobile app and dedicated partner access. Its media management made simple. As a result, sports organisations and entertainment brands have the infrastructure they need to produce great content that engages fans and builds strong communities. Notable clients already include AS Monaco, Orlando City, Real Sociedad, Ironman & Corinthians. In addition to having these big club names as early adopters, having Mario Götze’s support gives great credentials to the firm amongst the sporting community – with both the corporates and the fans. Victorien Tixier, CEO of ScorePlay: “First time we met Mario, we knew it would be a great match. He immediately recognised the problems we are solving and understood how we fit into the market. We’re really happy to be able to work with him and excited about what we can do together.” The funds will be used to further target the US and German markets, with the appointment of a new growth manager and money invested in expanding the tech and marketing team’s budget."

Already operating in Europe and the US, the Polish startup is now ready to expand further. Working in the healthcare sector brings many challenges – customer service needn’t be one of them. Aiming to make fully automated customer service solutions that streamline and simplify telephone hotlines, Polish startup Talkie.ai has developed an AI-based platform and is ramping up development and expansion. New Funding Today, Talkie.ai has announced a new raise of about €2.5 million from a Polish-Austrian consortium of VC funds. It includes 4growth VC, NIF ASI, Satus Starter, FundingBox, Gateway Ventures and Movens VC. Shareholders include the LT Capital fund, which invested in the company at an earlier stage of its development. Talkie.ai – Automating customer service solutions Talkie.ai is developing in a niche but important sector, developing fully automated customer service solutions for organisations where the leading channel of contact is a telephone hotline – more specifically in the healthcare sector. The healthcare sector faces many challenges, and providing quality customer services is an additional burden they have to face. From the growing and seasonally varying volume of calls from patients, the need for 24/7 availability of medical registration, to the necessity to offer multilingual telephone-based patient support, the challenges faced would all benefit from a touch of automation and digitalisation. Founded in 2018, Talkie.ai wants to provide that. Ada Andruszkiewicz, Head of Operations at Talkie.ai said: “With our bots, you just want to talk. This is important because our solutions typically handle about 80 percent of customer inquiries, reducing call center operating costs by up to half. This is also one of the reasons for the interest in the healthcare industry. In wealthy yet aging Western societies, there is a growing demand for efficient remote handling of patient inquiries. At the same time there is strong pressure to reduce costs through automation.” The Polish startup additionally offers automation services for optimizing other common hospital and clinic processes, such as allowing callers to make and manage appointments as a self-service, order prescriptions, and provide information on pricing and availability of services, or basic medical triage. It can also integrate with patient appointment management systems, as well as with a number of the largest providers of call centre systems on the market. Krzysztof Bachta, managing partner of the 4growth VC fund, commented: “The solutions offered by Talkie.ai respond to current economic trends: rising labor costs and automation of business processes. This translates into a growing demand for conversational bots using artificial intelligence. We were convinced to invest by the competence of the founding team and the finished product. The Talkie.ai solution surprises us with its simplicity of use, speed of implementation, as well as quality – much higher compared to solutions I have had the opportunity to observe in many companies.” Tailored Product Talkie.ai has centred its solution around the healthcare space – offering a valuable and helpful solution to an overburdened workforce. It’s also meant that the team has been able to create voicebots that have over 90% accuracy in understanding caller intent after just the first 10 data samples. Using voice cloning tech makes the voicebots sound more natural, further enhancing the client experience. The solution also stands out for having short implementation times – ranging from as little as one day for simple business processes to just under several weeks for more complex implementations. Configuration and operation of the voicebots are done from an administration panel that gives the user full autonomy and control over their operation. Further, choosing one of Talkie.ai’s standard, industry-specific solutions means that implementation doesn’t require a single line of code to be written. There is also the ability to fully customize the product to the specific needs of an organisation – making the product unique. Krzysztof Szubert, CEO of NCBR Investment Fund, commented: “New technologies, Artificial Intelligence – based, are an opportunity and a developmental necessity for the health care system. Civilizational health challenges require the introduction of new digital solutions, optimization of operations and practical applications of Artificial Intelligence. The Polish startup Talkie.ai is responding to such demands, boldly entering the next stage of growth and thinking about further expansion into the US market. NIF is making an investment in the company together with its partners, recognizing its huge market potential.” What’s Next Conversational Artificial Intelligence is a relatively new market, and it’s growing fast – estimated to be worth around €16 billion by 2024. The healthcare sector is buying into virtual assistants big time, finding it the most efficient way to optimise interactions with clients. Talkie.ai reports that by 2027, the market for virtual assistants in healthcare will be worth over €2.6 billion. Talkie.ai is already operating in the US, UK and Poland. This new capital injection will be sued to further specialize and tailor the tech and to supercharge expansion in the US. Supporting healthcare industries with specialized off-the-shelf solutions is driving Talkie’s next phase of operations. Pawel Lipinski, CEO and Co-Founder: “We intend to use the financing we raised to further develop our healthcare offering and expand overseas, primarily in the US, from where we already derive more than a third of our revenue. Given the scale of the healthcare market in the US, we see the greatest growth potential there. We also anticipate further expansion of our team, as well as the introduction of off-the-shelf offerings for other industries, tailored to their specific needs.”"
2022.7.22,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/biotech-startup-probiotic-group-secures-e2-5-million-for-its-sustainable-probiotic-care-and-cleaning-products/,"Luxembourg-based Probiotic Group has secured €2.5 million of fresh investment. The Biotech startup is developing probiotic care and cleaning products that clean effectively and sustainably. These are the first external funds raised by the company. Founded in 2014, Probiotic Group was launched with the vision to take a biotech approach to cleansers. Martin Schoonbroodt, the entrepreneur and orthodontist behind the company, has developed a line of products that are based on an understanding of the importance of microbiomes. Speaking about the company’s aim, founder Martin Schoonbroodt commented: “We want to become a recognised player in the science of green biotechnology with the primary aim of offering alternatives to traditional consumer products with the benefits of biotics, creating or recreating symbioses, i.e. a microbial balance in our living and working spaces, not forgetting personal care.” The Luxembourg-based company’s products offer a sustainable alternative to traditional cleaners. They can fight microbial dysbiosis (or imbalance) and at the same time optimize different biological environments. Microbial cleaners are growing in popularity in Europe and the US, seen as being better for the skin and more effective. Probiotic Group has also committed itself to taking a sustainable approach to its product range – based on the principle of the circular economy and with respect towards humans, animals and the environment. Further, the company is forging a progressive path for itself in terms of its genetic makeup as the team is equitable along gender lines. Martin added: “We disrupt the way we work with bacteria, for the good. Reequilibrating our environments with no harsh chemicals.” Looking to the future, the biotech group want to step up R&D activities, with plans to make developments in the rinse-off and leave-on cosmetics space. This is in addition to increasing the team’s headcount. Martin: “I am tremendously happy to welcome two new strategic partners in the shareholder structure of my company. This fundraising will accelerate our development on an international landscape plus give us the ability to speed up our R&D activities in Luxembourg. Not many biotech firms in Luxembourg get this chance, we are well aware of this. I want to thank all involved parties that made this happen; our employees played a primary role in this as our expertise is unmatched – true pioneers.”"
2022.7.25,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/lottie-lands-e7-million-to-simplify-the-search-for-quality-elderly-care-and-picks-up-a-valuation-of-over-e52-million/,"London-based Lottie has just raised an additional €7 million for its platform which is making the process of finding the right elderly care stress-free and simple. The startup has now reached a valuation of over €52 million and its growing fast. Finding elderly care for loved ones is inherently a sensitive process. It’s something that often proves stressful, expensive and complicated. Indeed founders Chris Donnelly and Will Donnelly, experienced this firsthand when looking for the best elderly care for their grandmother. It pushed them to launch Lottie in 2021 – a free-to-use digital healthcare marketplace and concierge service that allows care and retirement seekers to locate and compare the UK’s best later-life living options at a fair price. The funding This latest capital boost for Lottie was led by General Catalyst and brings the company’s valuation to over €52 million – it’s fresh off the back of a €2.98 million raise in February this year, which was led by Kindred. Lottie has also previously received backing from the likes of Monzo founder Tom Blomfield and Lendable co-founder Victoria van Lennep. Chris Donnelly: “After closing with Kindred in January, we experienced unprecedented demand from funds. The first few months of 2022 have been hugely successful for us, so we decided to bring General Catalyst on by extending the seed round to further support our growth in the industry.” Lottie: Reimaging the elderly care search Taking a digital approach to helping find the best care provisions for our loved ones, Lottie offers a marketplace that enables easy-to-use search and comparison tools. It’s free to use, keeping it accessible to all and democratising how users find the best care options. The news comes as demand for elderly care services continues to grow. Across Europe, the population is ageing and care provisions are under pressure. As people live longer, families increasingly need to find quality solutions for taking care of elderly relatives, while juggling other commitments such as childcare and work. It means the market for elderly care is also growing, reported to be worth trillions by 2029. With Lottie, elderly people and their loved ones are given the freedom to design their ideal care package. Lottie then distils millions of data points on the 2000 high-quality care facilities and 300 independent retirement properties in England on the site to help people find the perfect home that meets their needs, wants and budget. Customers and enquiry numbers were up 115% in the three months to the end of June, compared with the previous three-month period between December 2021 and March 2022. From outstanding care ratings and 5* customer reviews to luxury facilities and thriving home experiences, the impact-driven startup partners with the UK’s best care homes that offer an enhanced resident experience and home culture like no other. Will Donnelly said: “COVID-19 has supercharged the move of the later living industry from offline to online, from the initial search process and how care seekers engage with later living communities, through to the adoption of digital care plans and new operational technologies. As well as assisting families and retirees in making important life decisions, Lottie is now helping our partner communities, both care and retirement, transition to the post COVID-19 digital world.” The impact The London-based marketplace is having a huge impact in the UK – supporting families across the country to choose better care options for their loved ones. Reflecting the growing demand, Lottie recently expanded beyond care homes into retirement living, giving retirees specialist support and expertise in finding alternative housing options for those who want to maintain their independence in later life. Chris Bischoff, Managing Director at General Catalyst commented: “Today, elderly care is characterised by a broken care seeker experience, constrained supply of high quality, affordable homes and an increasingly challenging operating environment. Lottie is this unique hybrid of matchmaker, comparison website and care property specialist. Blending smart technology with a dedicated team of care experts, the platform is proving itself to be an indispensable ally in helping families and retirees make easy informed choices about elderly care. Lottie’s mission to ‘elevate elder care’ aligns with General Catalyst’s Health Assurance thesis to drive more digitally enabled, decentralised, preventative, and equitable healthcare.” With the new funding, Lottie is set to expand nationally, adding new care partners and bringing its marketplace and software tools to more businesses and people around the UK. Will added: “Lottie’s operational technology is already being used by hundreds of the UK’s most forward-thinking later living providers, which has been fundamental in allowing an improved customer experience, but also delivering better health outcomes for residents, and, in the long-term, will help deliver a sustainable industry which can meet the care needs of our rapidly ageing population.” Committed to care Further investment will also be made in developing Lottie’s technology offering to help care homes with all aspects of their business, for example, Lottie will be developing operational tools to help care homes and retirement operators to improve their day-to-day servicing of residents. It will also be used to help bolster the team of specialist care advisers that can handle the whole care home search process, from research facilities, discussing care facilities, negotiating residency fees as well as overseeing the legal process. As part of its mission to drive change, Lottie is also planning to continue growing Seniorcare by Lottie, the UK’s only elder care benefits solution for businesses looking to support employees who are searching for care or helping an elderly loved one. Chris Donnelly added: “Even though we’re rapidly expanding, we’re still so focused on Lottie’s core values. They’re at the heart of everything the team does. The care homes listed on Lottie are handpicked and have been vetted by Lottie’s team of care experts based on their care quality, home culture and ethical practices. We’re more committed than ever before to finding the right homes for care seekers and ensuring families feel as safe, secure, and happy with their decision.The marketplace is just the start of our vision for the later living sector, we see it as a springboard to improve the global sector as a whole: from consumer transparency, technologies inefficiencies and lack of high quality data insights.”"

2022.7.25,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/us-based-startup-density-acquires-prevision-io-to-supercharge-emea-expansion/,"In today’s world, almost everything we do is monitored, tracked and even dictated by data. Now, with a privacy-first approach, US-company Density is going to fuel data-driven decisions about how spaces, specifically offices, should be designed in Europe with the aim to improve humanity’s footprint on the earth. Density Acquires Prevision.io US-based Density has just announced the acquisition of Paris-based data science company, Prevision.io. The transaction comes as part of Density’s wider plans to expand its presence in Europe and is part of the company’s acqui-hire strategy. Density is on a mission to measure and improve humanity’s footprint on the world. The startup’s innovative tech – privacy-first hardware plus proprietary software – is helping inform decisions for the workplaces of some of the world’s leading organisations and it’s having a societal, cultural, financial and environmental impact. Density has also shared that JC Groon is joining the team to lead this international expansion, with initial operations taking place in Ireland and the UK. Density: Rethinking our relationship with space Founded in San Francisco, Density has been encouraging us to reconsider our relationship with physical space and the built environment since 2014. The company believes that measuring buildings and how we use them can have an immense environmental, social, and financial impact – and it’s imperative to bring about a sustainable future. The company has developed privacy-first sensors and a rich analysis platform that contextualises the data the sensors provide. Coupled together, the result provides companies with the ability to understand how people use space, and, through the data, insights and actionable recommendations provided, companies can adapt their spaces accordingly. Essentially, it provides vital insights and actionable ideas to companies on how to lower operational costs, improve employee experience in the space, and, help companies reduce their carbon footprint. Buildings might just be the most valuable assets in the world whose performance we don’t currently measure, and yet, their construction and maintenance come at an extraordinary cost. Globally, more than 11,000 new commercial buildings are built each day, with this figure on track to climb to nearly 13,000 by 2030, and yet 40% of U.S. office space is vacant but paid for (pre-pandemic). And the impact of this unused space goes beyond wasted capital – buildings account for 39% of global CO2 emissions. Historically, buildings have been designed and used based on observation, trends and surveys. Now is the time to optimise and approach with a digital and data-driven angle. Prevision.io: AI management tools Based in Paris, Prevision.io has been building tools that bring powerful AI management capabilities to data science users since 2016. It enables more AI projects to make it into production and stay there. Clients have successfully used the platform for multiple use cases, including sales and promotions forecasting, churn prediction, supply chain optimization, predictive maintenance, buildings energy consumption forecasting and so forth. Andrew Farah, CEO and co-founder of Density, commented: “Our customers are already using Density globally – our sensors are deployed in 32 countries because the multinational companies we work with need insights into all their offices, not just those in the US – so having a team in based EMEA is a natural next step. In order to make good on our mission – to measure and improve humanity’s footprint on the world – we’ll need a truly global presence, and both the Prevision team and J C will be instrumental to our future growth.” Density’s EMEA Expansion This new acquisition deal will provide Density with access to Prevision.io’s extensive data science expertise. It will contribute rich data science know-how to Density’s analytics platform and enhance its capabilities. The platform provides an incredibly comprehensive insight into how space is used, including the ability to easily compare the performance of spaces to one another or to portfolio benchmarks. With this deal, Density is taking a major step in its EMEA expansion plans. Prevision’s engineer team will remain in Paris, giving the US innovators a foothold in the French capital. But it’s only one piece of the plans to expand into Europe, plans which are led by J C Groon, who joined the firm in March. Groon was most recently a Global Clients leader at LinkedIn and has also held roles at Cisco, NAVTEQ (now HERE Technologies), and Accenture. Groon commented: “EMEA has some of the most advanced privacy protections in the world, and given the privacy-first way in which Density has developed its technology, we’re uniquely positioned to be able to deliver rich, actionable insights to companies in the region without sacrificing employee privacy. We’ve also found customers in EMEA to be ahead of the curve in considering how their square footage impacts their carbon footprint; leaders in the region understand that measuring and optimizing use of their physical space is a meaningful way to not only reduce overall operational costs, but to improve their environmental impact as well.” Density’s goal is to deliver valuable insights to companies without compromising employee privacy. Through market research, the firm has uncovered that EMEA customers and businesses are leading the way on awareness of measuring and reducing their carbon footprint – and how optimizing physical space can do so. So, expanding into EMEA is a natural step. The plan is to make an international headquarters in Ireland – a strategic base that benefits from the ability to open the door into Europe as well as close proximity to the UK. The acqui-hire strategy This acquisition deal also reflects part of the wider expansion strategy held by Density – that of the Acqui-Hire. Scaling startups entering new markets whilst developing cutting-edge tech, have to balance some realities – one of the big ones is attracting the best talent to achieve goals, with the ability to compete with wage offers, as well as having the relevant local market know-how. For US companies, this means looking outside the expensive Silicon Valley is one way. An acqui-hire is being regarded as a mutually beneficial way to onboard talent into teams, accelerate product development, and at the same time, give smaller startups an opportunity to pursue their work without the stress of fundraising in a capital-constraint and financial-uncertain environment. And it seems to be working for Density. This is the firm’s third acquisition in the past year – it bought Nashi in June 2021, and HELIX RE in November. Both of these teams have been able to provide talent and tech – supporting Density’s dreams. Acquiring Prevision.io is forecasted to do the same."
2022.7.25,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/portuguese-startup-spotlite-secures-e1-5-million-for-its-space-monitoring-tech/,"Spacetech startup Spotlite has just secured €1.5 million in fresh funding. The Portuguese startup has developed an infrastructure monitoring system, using satellite imagery, that can give early detection of harmful events. Developments in the spacetech vertical are giving us incredibly valuable insights here on earth. Through satellite imagery and technology, improved forecasts and insights into life on earth can be generated, giving us greater prediction capabilities and oversight. Portugal is picking up pace in the European space sector, with startups like Spotlite putting the nation on the map as an emerging spacetech hub. The Funding Spotlite has announced the raise of a €1.5 million Seed round to supercharge its expansion and product development. Funding for the Coimbra-based company was led by Indico and EDP Ventures with participation from Portugal Ventures and Shilling. Spotlite: Harnessing satellite imagery Founded in 2017 by Ricardo Cabral and Martino Correia, Spotlite offers an infrastructure monitoring SaaS solution based on satellite imagery. The platform is able to provide risk analytics and recommendations, and, can allow for early detection of potentially harmful events – for example, ground and slope subsidence, vegetation encroachment, flooding or third-party interference. The Coimbra-born startup started out in the transportation sector and has since expanded to use in mining sites, energy infrastructure and buildings. Luís Manuel, Managing Partner at EDP Ventures explained: “Spotlite contributes so that, using a combination of satellite data, and data from local sensors, EDP’s teams can carry out continuous monitoring activities at a large scale and with high precision, thus allowing for effective predictive maintenance activities, and the early detection of potentially harmful events, in turn minimizing the downtime of critical infrastructures, such as those of the energy sector.” This funding comes fresh on the back of Spotlite’s successful entry into the UK market, through a pilot with a highway concessionaire. Spotlite won a UK Tech Rocketship Award in Portugal and attended the London Tech Week, where it was one of the semi-finalists. Stephan Morais, Managing General Partner of Indico Capital, added: “Spotlite is transforming the way infrastructure companies manage risk and preventive maintenance with accurate data and actionable recommendations. Current solutions are project-based and the market is huge and increasing, hence our investment from day one”. Future plans The startup is now also accredited by ANI (National Agency of Innovation) as an entity with professional competence for developing R&D activities. This new investment will be used to target further product development and commercial expansion. Spotlite aims to make key hires to further fuel its plans. Co-founder Martino Correia explained: “The new funding round presents an amazing opportunity and a significant step towards the implementation of our vision. Taking place nearly one year after our initial pre-seed round, it will accelerate the development of Spotlite and the growth of the team behind it, providing to our clients a unique toolset for infrastructure monitoring. Companies such as Egis, EDP or Brisa are already using Spotlite for structural health monitoring and risk analysis. Now we intend to expand to other European and LatAm markets, pursuing the goal of establishing a leading global position.”"
2022.7.25,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/london-based-altruistiq-raises-e17-6-million-for-its-climate-tech-software/,"Becoming one of the world’s best-funded climate tech SaaS startups, Altruistiq has just raised about €17.6 million. The London-based team aims to change the standard carbon reporting model into a carbon abatement model, effecting more beneficial climate action. Sustainability SaaS solutions are growing in popularity and importance. It’s a sector that provides the vital tech needed to reach climate targets and, finally, reach zero. The market is reported to be worth almost €8 million and growing at more than 30% CAGR. Aiming to enter this market, and fundamentally change how we look at carbon reporting, Altrquistiq has now raised about €17.6 million. The Funding The €17.6 million capital boost is significant – it puts Altruistiq amongst the best-funded climate tech software companies globally. Molten led the funding alongside Norrsken and angel investors, Greg Jackson, Mudassir Sheikha and Siraj Khaliq, and Sir Ian Cheshire. Altruistiq: Towards a ‘carbon abatement’ model Founded in 2020, the London-based startup is pioneering a carbon abatement model. It’s a process that goes deeper than simply committing to carbon offsets through identifying emission and reduction initiatives. Instead, Altruistiq’s offering is directly impacting how clients do business – creating change that is better embedded in business processes, and, therefore, with greater long-term efficacy. For example, using data generated by Altruistiq, leading UK recipe box provider, Gousto, is tackling decarbonisation on two fronts: suppliers’ farming methods and the mix of recipes and ingredients it sells. It’s surveying its suppliers to get a better understanding of their carbon footprint and is looking to see how it can use Altruistiq to help its suppliers make their practices more sustainable, which would improve Gousto’s footprint in turn. The company has surfaced insights using Altruistiq that allow it to reduce the carbon impact of its current recipes down to the individual ingredient. For example, Gousto discovered that sourcing tomatoes from Seville had a lower carbon impact than sourcing from the UK. Such insights help Gousto make more informed sourcing and recipe-development decisions. Saif Hameed, CEO & founder explained: “We’ve seen a big shift towards businesses embracing the ‘carbon accounting’ space. Whilst this is a helpful tailwind, inaccurate data sets and a resulting lack of granular calculation, leads to generic emission factors that can leave organisations open to charges of greenwashing. We, at Altruistiq, are focused on giving businesses the data engineering tools to better understand their actual impact, whilst also enhancing their credibility on sustainability.” The impact The climate tech startup believes that sustainability is the world’s biggest data issue. WIthout extreme accuracy, transparency and quality, business decisions can be misinformed, investment limited, and teamwork misaligned. The promised environmental impact won’t be achieved. Through Altruistiq’s software, the aim is to bring about genuine change with enhanced data accuracy. George Chalmers, Head of Climate at Molten Ventures said: “Altruistiq is already proving the power of its platform which we believe can be the category leader of a rapidly evolving market. There is an increasing need and demand for a carbon abatement solution to go beyond just reporting and Altruistiq is in a strong position to meet those needs. We are delighted to back such an exceptional team and look forward to joining them on this exciting journey.” With this new funding boost, the young startup will continue to champion its abatement engine and empower more clients with its granular data reporting and business intelligent impact management. Alexander Danielsson, Investment Director at Norrsken VC, added: “At Norrsken VC we back entrepreneurs that are solving the world’s biggest challenges. Altruistiq provides a sustainability platform where corporates can, among other metrics, measure, and plan initiatives to abate emissions in a simple and effective way. Enabling corporates to abate their emissions is the biggest lever to take us to net zero. We are delighted to be partnering up with Saif and the Altruistiq team to solve our climate crisis.”"
2022.7.26,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/10-super-promising-lisbon-based-startups-to-watch-in-2022-and-beyond/,"Lisbon. The most westerly capital of Europe, a city known for its sunkissed streets, culinary heritage and its inviting, feel-good ambience, Lisbon naturally encourages innovation and inspiration. The lifestyle and buzzing energy that abounds from the city, along with an affordable cost of living and heavy tech investments have, in recent years, made the Portuguese capital an emerging startup hive of activity. Lisbon-based startups are springing up left, right and centre, companies are setting up hubs there and Portugal is swiftly becoming a digital nomad’s paradise. Investment in the startup scene in Lisbon has grown by 30% every year since 2016 – twice the average of the rest of Europe. Lisbon also benefits from a number of startup hubs and communities, helping to cultivate an entrepreneurial spirit. There’s Made of Lisboa which is an entrepreneurial community of Lison-based innovators making startup business ideas and ambitions feel at home. It provides collaborative workspaces, networking opportunities and the chance to meet the people who can turn a vision into reality – augmented, virtual or otherwise. There’s also Startup Lisboa which launched in 2021 as a private non-profit association that supports the creation of companies and their first years of activity. It provides entrepreneurs with office space as well as a valuable support structure. Always a city with an international outlook, Lisbon has been regarded as the number one city for digital nomads, and the fifth best city for ex-pats in the world. Let’s not also forget that Lisbon is the European home of Web Summit – one of Europe’s most popular startup events.Back in January of this year, we took a look at the key trends we can expect in Portugal as a whole. From remote-first approaches to priorities on sustainability – we envisioned an exciting year for the nation’s startup community – and we’ve not been disappointed. All of this and more, make Lisbon, undoubtedly, one of the hottest and most popular and prolific places for startups, entrepreneurs, thought leaders and innovators. So, without further ado, here are ten startups that are skyrocketing from Lisbon – all founded post-2019. Kitch – Founded in 2019, Kitch is helping restaurants go digital without losing their autonomy and business independence. The Lisbon-based startup has developed an app that enables users to enjoy their favourite restaurant food at home, whilst allowing the restaurants to serve the city from kitchens that are tailored to food delivery services. It means that restaurants can remain connected to their customers, maintaining that special bond between chef and consumer. Kitch’s proprietary tech empowers restauranteurs to be in control of their digital orders, removing the need for a middleman company and reducing costs. In 2021, the startup cooked up €3.25 million and they’ve been expanding since. Bairro – Reimaging the supermarket experience with a digital approach, Bairro is a Lisbon-founded startup that is scaling fast. Launched in Lisbon in 2020 by young-entrepreneurs Artem Kokhan and Milana Dovzhenko, the Bairro app allows fast delivery of supermarket goods, with a focus on quality user experience, speedy delivery, and a high standard of products. The vision behind the startup is to be a helping hand for consumers – the app that is there when you need it, whether it be a special ingredient that’s missing to make the perfect dinner or a last-minute ice-cream necessity. The startup is also pushing forward sustainability in the food supply chain – it is powered by green logistics and helps to reduce food waste. The challenges in the supply chain are solved by having an end-to-end approach while operating central warehouses where brands and local farmers deliver all the goods, with no intermediaries in between. It’s an inherently personalised approach. The ecommerce startup secured €1.2 million in 2021. ScorePlay – Sports tech startup ScorePlay has developed a SaaS platform to revolutionise how sports and entertainment brands manage media assets. Based in Lisbon, it has now scored more than €1 million in funding – also reporting a 30% MoM growth in revenue over the past 6 months. Founded in 2020, the startup is committed to helping brands deliver more engaging content and to create a wider reach for their media assets, the startup is gaining popularity with some very big names in the sports industry – world cup winning footballer Mario Götze, for example, has even got involved in an investment capacity aside from vocally supporting the innovative approach. The ScorePlay platform gives brands a dedicated space to centralise media assets together, the assets can then be classified via an integrated AI tagging system, before being distributed to identified athletes/ artists and sponsors automatically through the ScorePlay mobile app and dedicated partner access – Media management made simple. Talent Protocol – Founded in Portugal’s capital city, Talent Protocol is an HRtech startup with a difference, aiming to reimagine how we engage professionally with each other. Founded in 2021, Talent Protocol enables users to use tokens to essentially bootstrap their careers and win over backers. ‘Talent Tokens’ can be purchased on the Web3 platform – it’s kind of like investing in shares in someone’s career, where both the undiscovered talent and their supporters get paid dividends over time. It’s a business proposition that sounds very futuristic, but Tanet Protocol is already growing fast and picking up steam. Talent Protocol is rooted in the belief that openness and transparency are better for the world – so it’s free to use and built to be carbon-negative. The startup raised €1.5 million at the end of 2021 and we also recommend the platform is a good one to check out if you’re trying to supercharge your career. Bloq.it – Founded in 2019, Bloq.it is a Lisbon-founded smart locker software solution developing a network of urban lockers. The aim is to create tech-enabled smart cities for the future. So what is a smart locker you ask? These are lockers located around cities that can be used for a range of things like parcel deliveries, item storage, exchanging items, office lockers and so forth. It solves the channels inherent in last-mile delivery, making getting items delivered and/or stored so much easier – say goodbye to the struggle of trying to coincide a delivery for when you’re at home. Bloq.it is now operating across the EU, MENA, Latam and the US Pleez – Founded in 2021, Pleez is helping restaurants optimise their menus and giving them a reported revenue increase of 15%. This Lisbon-based startup is helping restaurants harness digital technology to improve processes and increase sales of strategic items. Restaurants might not be the typical place that comes to mind when thinking about sales increase and algorithms and data analysis, but Pleez is showing that using a tech approach can help restaurants become more strategic and as a result sell more. Restaurant owners and managers simply feed information and objectives to Pleez’s platform, which then, using proprietary algorithms is able to identify how to increase sales on delivery websites. It’s saving time, increasing efficiency and freeing-up administrative burden. The startup has now raised over €1.5 million and working across Southern Europe with brands like 100 Montaditos. Detech.ai – Described as a one-stop-shop for site reliability insights, detech.ai is empowering software teams with better monitoring and optimization tools. The Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) platform has been built to generate optimal, incident-free user experiences, and it’s caught the attention of Techstars – being part of the New York City Accelerator. Founded in 2020, the platform takes the hassle away from the user, presenting monitoring data on a site’s reliability intuitively. This means that software teams are able to make action plans quicker and deliver enhanced experiences to their customers. The Open Beta of the Reliability Intelligence platform is now launched to the public. It’s aiming to bring both the big picture visibility necessary for decision-making over reliability decisions, and accelerate root-cause analysis (RCA) by providing a detailed view of an issue’s impact across user journeys, services, products, and more. NEVARO – NEVARO was founded in 2020 and provides a series of digital solutions for mental health, wellbeing, and performance based on physiological biomarkers and gamification. Their solutions aim to complement the psychotherapeutic process through serious gaming and physiological computing. NEVARO also develops solutions for VR & AR exposure therapy, immersive mindfulness, and more. The health startup also aims to optimise healthcare systems by tracking key metrics of the performance of medical teams, treatment outcomes, and patient experience. LUGGit – Taking a new approach to how luggage is transported, LUGGit is one of Europe’s fastest-growing luggage startups. Founded in 2019, LUGGit connects travellers with independent drivers who can collect and deliver luggage at the customer’s convenience – so no more lugging heavy and in-the-way bags when you’re on that next city break or relaxing vacation. Travellers can quickly and easily book the service and track their luggage in real-time, giving peace of mind to users. It also allows accommodation providers to offer the service to their guests in a revenue share model, with no setup fees. Circular Unity – Fueling a future of sustainable smart events, Circular Unity is really on to something new – and it’s a refreshing advancement for the event sector. Founded in 2021, Circular Unity has developed software that measures, analyzes, reports on and can then help reduce emissions coming from an event, turning any event into an ‘eco-event’. The startup’s first product, impactALL is an all-in-one tool that empowers event organizers to forecast sustainability throughout the entire event lifecycle. With it, organizers can benefit from automated data-collection to predict carbon emissions, target reduction, and, to receive actionable insights to increase revenue through resource use optimization and achieve carbon neutrality.

2022.7.26,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/berlin-based-bunch-bags-e7-3-million-for-its-platform-removing-barriers-to-private-investments/,"Building an operating system for private market investors, Berlin-based startup bunch raises €7.3 million. The fintech company is making the private market asset class easier to access amid the explosion of investment in this space. While the financial world has been undergoing tidal wave forces of change and private market investment has exploded over the past decade – there has been something missing. We are yet to see considerable progress in how investments into private assets are made and managed. It’s meant that private market investments have remained available to a specific group. Bunch aim to change this, with a tech platform that allows investors to easily pool investments across private market asset classes. Bunch: Building the OS for private market investors Foudned in 2021 by Enrico Ohnemüller & Levent Altunel, the fintech startup is building the OS for private market investing. The bunch OS is an asset & jurisdiction agnostic investment platform, enabling investors to set up and manage their investment entities in a seamless way while at the same time offering investors more professional tools. It was born out of a shared frustration with the lack of innovation in the private asset investment space. Enrico’s prior experiences at finleap, the fintech company builder, as well as Goldman Sachs made him acutely aware of the significant barriers involved in accessing private markets. Meanwhile, Levent worked for Citigroup and Roland Berger before becoming an early-stage investor for a Berlin-based VC fund, where he experienced the difficulty of setting up investment entities first-hand. Levant commented: “Investors have been waiting for a solution like this that takes away all the admin work of investing and helps investors to become more professional at the same time.” A sentiment which was echoed by co-founder Enrico: “We are giving our customers access to a toolset that previously was only available for the largest private investors, including pro-rata monetisation protecting dilution on your winners and risk diversification through collective investing. We are building on top of larger tech organizations for scalability which allows us to focus on customer value and process flexibility from day one.” Bunch’s platform enables investors to create their own investment syndicates and track all of their investments in one place. It’s democratising access to this exploding investment space, previously limited to only those with access to both opportunities and large amounts of capital. Individual investors have been struggling to get in on the private market boom and bunch wants to change this. The platform helps remove the barriers to investing collectively which diversifies risk and democratizes access to unique investment opportunities. Over the past three months, the platform which is currently live in beta in Germany and the Netherlands has transacted close to €150 million of assets under admin across startup investments and funds. Filip Dames, Founding Partner at Cherry Ventures said: “The bunch team, led by Levent and Enrico, is unlocking private markets for investing with, first, their one-stop-shop solution — the bunch OS. We know how cumbersome gaining access to these markets can be, so we were immediately impressed when we witnessed bunch’s streamlined, simple solution. We believe that this tool is the first step on the journey to provide liquidity to private markets and become a true operating system for investors. We’re thrilled that this round will further revolutionize how all private market stakeholders — be it founders and funders — invest, interact, and exchange.” The funding This new funding round for the Berlin-founded startup was led by European early-stage fund Cherry Ventures. embedded/capital, who led bunch’s previously undisclosed pre-seed round, also participated. Ramin Niroumand, Managing Partner at embedded/capital added: “We know from our experience as founders, operators and investors that private markets are far from digitized, with limited liquidity and fragmented access contributing to a generally painful process for all market participants. When we first started our conversations with Enrico and Levent last year, we collectively saw the potential of building on existing fintech infrastructure to launch a holistic suite of financial products across jurisdictions and assets – the bunch OS – to transform the way we interact with private markets. We are thrilled to be part of bunch’s journey from the very beginning, as well as happy customers.” Additionally, a number of European angel investors got in on the action. Including, Adyen, Klarna, Juni, and Moonfare as well as private market investment and fintech experts such as Cristina Stenbek (lead shareholder at Kinnevik, chairperson of the Zalando Supervisory Board and non-executive director of Spotify), Pip Klöckner (investment influencer & Host at Doppelgänger Tech Talk), and Jan Deepen’s Discovery Ventures. The capital boost will be used to expand the platform across additional geographies and asset classes. Also, the team will continue to advance the technical and product development of its holistic software platform to make it easier for all investors to participate in private markets."
2022.7.26,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/irish-startup-cropbiome-raises-e1-3-million-to-make-our-food-supply-more-sustainable-and-secure/,"Agritech startup CropBiome has just picked up a yield of €1.3 million in its mission to create a more sustainable and secure food model. The Irish startup is a joint spin-out from University College Dublin (UCD) and Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and is aiming to make a global impact with its biotech solution. With climate change having an increasingly concerning impact on crop yields and water supplies, coupled with global socio-political contexts, the world’s food supply chain is under immense pressure – and action needs to be taken to secure supply and create a sustainable model. With the aim of creating healthier and more resilient crops, CropBiome has just secured €1.3 million of fresh funding. CropBiome: Towards a more sustainable food model A spin-out from Ireland’s top universities, UCD and TCD, CropBiome sources, selects, ferments, characterises and tests microbes (organisms) derived from wild plant species that are closely related to mass-produced wheat and other cereal crops. The microbes – which are natural and unharmful to plant and animal life – are used to create seed dressings, which coat the raw seeds of the mass-produced crops, and produce healthier crops as a result. In a combination of field and greenhouse trials, it’s been demonstrated that these seed dressings can improve crops’ performance – even in challenging conditions such as drought or when fertiliser use is reduced. It means fewer chemicals need to be used, crops are more resilient and soil health is improved. In turn, this brings economic benefits to farmers and health benefits to us all. Sean Daly, CEO, CropBiome, said: “Pressure is mounting on food producers across the world to move to a more sustainable food model. A key aim of the EU Farm to Fork Strategy is to reduce chemical use in agriculture – including fertilisers, fungicides, pesticides. It also targets the reduction of nutrient losses by at least 50%, while ensuring that there is no deterioration in soil fertility. The European Commission has indicated that a reduction in fertiliser use of at least 20% by 2030 will be needed to achieve these targets across the EU.” “CropBiome’s product development and market entry strategy is aligned to help meet these targets. Initially, we will aggressively tackle the European grain market – which represents a significant proportion of the world’s total grain production – with our unique sustainable biological solutions, which are the result of five years of extensive scientific research by our founders Prof. Fiona Doohan at UCD and Prof. Trevor Hodkinson and Dr Brian Murphy at TCD.” The impact-driven startup is therefore offering a real solution to a real problem. Currently, CropBiome has a biobank of more than 600 microbes, which the company is testing to determine their impact on stress resistance, nutrient use efficiency and overall crop yields. The funding The funding round was led by HBAN (Halo Business Angel Network), the all-island organisation responsible for the promotion of business angel investment, and a joint initiative of Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and Invest Northern Ireland. Niamh Sterling, Consultant, HBAN, said: “Investment in start-ups that make a positive, real-world impact is rising. Future-looking businesses like CropBiome are solving pressing issues that will make the world a better place and that is very attractive from an angel investor’s perspective. It is rewarding in terms of returns, and also an overall sense of making a difference in the world.” Angels from HBAN Singapore and HBAN Bloom Equity syndicate invested €405K in the business, with other investments coming from DeepIE Ventures Management Company Ltd and Enterprise Ireland High Potential Start-Ups Funding. Dr. Daniel Kearney, Chair, HBAN Singapore, said: “CropBiome is an extremely exciting biotechnology company that is solving a global problem, locally in Ireland. As a result, they have not only secured funding from investors in Ireland, but also from our Singapore HBAN syndicate and two HBAN angels in Belgium.” The plans This new funding will be used by the team, currently based at NovaUCD in Dublin, to grow from its current team of eight to 12 by year-end 2023. The roles will cover laboratory and field scientists, as well as business development personnel. They will be essential in helping CropBiome to partner, and carry out trials, with major seed distributors in Europe’s largest grain markets – the UK, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Germany, France and Spain. Sean Daly added: “We aim to enter the market at a similar price point as existing chemical seed coating products with our biological sustainable alternative and believe that this will give us a major competitive advantage. By 2025, we expect that our success in Europe will enable us to expand into North and South America, Australasia and other cereal-producing regions and countries.” The company expects that this work will enable it to bring its products to market by mid-2025, with revenues expected to reach €5 million by the end of that year. Sean also said: “We are delighted to take on this seed round funding, which will help us to accelerate the commercial development of our products. The funding from HBAN angels, as well as their guidance, has been strategically very important to us as we seek to grow our team and look ahead to Series A funding in 2024. Our funders have valuable in-depth industry knowledge and truly believe in our product and the real-world, environmental impact that it will have.”"

The Madrid-based startup has created a digital solution for vehicle renting – making it simpler and more cost-effective for users. Car renting allows easy access to a vehicle for many people. Consisting of a set monthly fee, that includes insurance and any repairs or services, it enables drivers to enjoy a new car for a period of time, without having to worry about the logistics of buying or selling a car. It’s becoming a popular option thanks to its relative affordability and flexibility. Leading the market in the Iberian Peninsula, Renting Finders is now setting off on a journey of European expansion. The startup, founded in 2018, has just raised €700k. Renting Finders: Digital renting marketplace Founded in Madrid by Arturo Álvarez Podhorecka and Javier Maside Echavarren, Renting Finders has been one of the leaders in the digitisation of the car rental space. The Spanish startup offers a fresh take on leasing, with a 100% digital, user-centric experience that allows a vehicle to be hired in just 15 minutes. The marketplace has added more than 2,000 vehicles from main leasing operators, with deliveries that can be made in less than 3 weeks right to their customer’s doorstep. In addition, it includes exclusive coverage that minimises the risk of non-monthly payments for its clients. Arturo Álvarez, CEO and co-founder of Renting Finders. “Despite the current shortage situation in the automotive sector, we were able to grow by 60% in 2021 and to successfully internationalise the company. Renting is already a reality among the private public and Renting Finders helps them to get a better service than they can get if they hire a vehicle on their own, at a better price, without added costs and without paperwork”. Currently operating in Spain and Portugal, the platform now has more than 3,000 private and professional clients with offices in Madrid and Lisbon. The funding This new funding round was led by Faraday Ventures Partners with existing investors such as Tadium Invest, IPGlobal, Koejans Capital and Sembi also participating.

Jaime Biel, Partner at Faraday added: “Renting Finders has experienced considerable growth since its inception and the company shows high long-term potential, which makes it a very attractive investment. We are very pleased to be able to support the company in its next phase of market consolidation.”"

2022.7.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/bucharest-based-sessions-scores-e4-4-million-to-upgrade-video-meetings/,"Making video meetings more engaging, Bucharest-based startup Sessions has raised about €4.4 million. Focusing on efficiency, engagement and execution, the startup is capitalising on the rise of remote and hybrid business interactions. The way we work and the ways businesses interact have undergone a massive change. Now, we are firmly in the era of online meetings – but, it still has some challenges to overcome. From keeping engagement and preventing yawning attendees, to navigating between tabs and controlling session flow, video meetings can become a tricky affair. Making it easier, Bucharest-based Sessions has developed a platform that brings tool stacks directly into meetings, keeping things efficient and engaging. From video meetings to Sessions Founded in 2020, Sessions was developed by founders Radu Negulescu and Radu Tintescu who saw an opportunity to upgrade the sub-standard video meeting experience. In 2020, we all shifted to predominately remote and hybrid work, and we all had to quickly master the zoom meeting experience – some with more success than others. Sessions was developed to make creating interactive meetings simpler. Radu Negulescu, Sessions founder and CEO, explained: “Everyone is aware of how radically the way we work has been transformed. Almost every customer-facing interaction now happens online, but most experiences still lack the structure, energy, information, and interactivity required to be truly powerful. That’s why we’ve set out to turn every substandard video call into a highly valuable ‘Session’ ”. By seamlessly integrating workflows, apps, information, and actions into a single platform, Sessions has redesigned the entire video conferencing experience to focus on efficiency, engagement, and execution for both organizations and their customers. From sales pitches to product demos; webinars to user research; and training to onboarding, Sessions enables teams to create the right structure; access the right information; deliver the right content; and seamlessly integrate native tools and productivity apps such as Google Drive and Miro, all within the same workspace. The funding Already making meetings more efficient for clients across the world, the platform launched in beta in July 2021, and picked up Product Hunt’s 2021 Work from Anywhere Product of the Year. This Seed funding was led by Earlybird Venture Capital (UiPath), Stride.VC (Cazoo) and Launchub Ventures (gtmhub). It’ll help the young company to continue growing and encourage a new era of optimized video meetings for the remote generation. Dan Lupu, partner at Earlybird, said: “The Video Conferencing and Collaboration needs of companies have grown and evolved in the past years, but the tools remained virtually the same. These single-purpose instruments create fragmented experiences and can’t cover newly emerging, complex use-cases. Sessions offers a unified platform that can efficiently address these needs while providing an engaging experience. Their unique mechanic allows companies to digitally engage with their customers in fluid, meaningful interactions no matter the complexity.”"
2022.7.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/munich-based-yoummday-acquires-icon-communications-centres-to-expand-its-reach/,"Munich-based startup Yoummday has today announced the acquisition of ICON Communications Centres, a central-European company providing outsourced customer operations. The acquisition reflects Yoummday’s position as an emerging market leader in Europe for its work-at-home OS for customer experience staff. Fresh on the heels of a €30 million raise in February this year, Yoummday has just made its first M&A deal, acquiring Prague-based ICON Communications. It’s part of the startup’s strategy to increase its range and multilingual capability, and, enables it to connect more customer talent to the digital platform. Yoummday has acquired the central European company from ESPIRA Investments s.r.o. (ESPIRA) and ICON’s executive management team as it continues to shake up the traditional BPO and contact centre models. Yoummday: New work models for customer services Founded in 2016, the Munich-based startup takes a new approach to how customer service workers operate, empowering a new generation of work-at-home in the profession. It was founded in Munich by telegate and GoYellow founder Dr. Klaus Harisch and his sons Pablo and Lion. Yoummday’s work-at-home operating system ([emailprotected] OS) gives independent entrepreneurs the ability to choose when and where they work across a variety of customer experience functions for the brand they like. As a result, companies of all sizes in any sector can take advantage of an engaged and scalable workforce, contributing a wide range of skills and languages to the Yoummday talent pool which acts as a marketplace. On the Yoummday platform, over 6,000 customer service talents from 65 nations working remotely from home are matched with client companies in need of professional customer service. Customers are enjoying the flexibility and range of talent this brings when building their workforce. They can also decide upon either a self-managed or Yoummday-managed deployment of services. The platform additionally takes care of quality assurance, the onboarding of new independent entrepreneurs and additional training. This acquisition adds significant expertise in multilingual capacity and global reach – a key component of Yoummday’s business proposition. ICON Communications Centres: Multilingual business process outsourcer Since 2003, ICON has been providing international companies with outsourced customer operations. It is, therefore, an early player in the market that Yoummday is shaking up and taking by storm. Given its decades of experience, ICON is able to bring significant benefits and expertise to the young startup, particularly with respect to native-level multilingual capability, global reach, and B2B customer experiences. ICON was co-founded by CEO Helen Hickin after identifying Prague as an ideal nearshore location due to its geography, advantageous price point, and the depth of multilingual talent available. It is capable of providing complex customer interactions in 30 languages and counts several of the world’s most well-known travel, telecommunication, and education technology companies within its client portfolio. Helen Hickin, CEO said: “We identified a gap in the market and opened the first outsourced BPO in Prague. Twenty years later, the BPO sector has changed significantly; through innovative technology, yoummday has found an exciting new way for companies to outsource operations with greater flexibility. It’s the right time for ICON’s next evolution and yoummday is perfectly positioned to ensure ICON’s clients continue to benefit from innovative delivery solutions” The Acquisition The financial details of this new deal remain undisclosed, but it is a significant movement in the market. It’s not often that startups pick up key market players so early on in their scaling process. Further, following Yoummday’s proven success within the EU, its move into both the US and UK markets is now expedited thanks to ICON’s existing operations. Dr. Klaus Harisch, CEO and Founder of Yoummday, commented: “The acquisition of ICON furnishes the opportunity to strengthen our growth strategy, which is predicated on integrating traditional BPO operators into our own proprietary marketplace platform. We look forward to working with the ICON team and weaving their unique capabilities into the yoummday brand” ICON’s C-Team will continue to operate alongside Yoummday, and the ICON brand remains in operation for the foreseeable future. The transaction sees Yoummday purchase 100% of ICON from CEE Communications s.r.o., of which CEE-based private equity firm ESPIRA, is the majority shareholder. Emilia Mamajova, ESPIRA’s Co-Founding Partner, stated: “Our goal together with the management team was to develop ICON on the international arena as a successful independent provider of high value-added services – and over the past three years Helen and her team have succeeded in reaching this objective. We congratulate them and wish the team continued success in their partnership with yoummday.”"
2022.7.27,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/uk-based-onto-raises-e59-million-to-fuel-the-ev-revolution-and-bring-its-subscription-service-across-europe/,"Electric car subscription service Onto has just raised over €59 million. The UK-based startup is fueling the rising electric vehicle (EV) revolution and is taking its fresh approach to the European continent. With the electric vehicle industry growing, there’s space to develop innovation that can make electric car usage more accessible – fueling a new era of driving that is less harmful to the planet and more forward-thinking. That is exactly what Onto aims to do, and they’ve just secured about €59 million in a Series C funding round. Onto: EV usership over ownership Founded in 2017 by Rob Jolly and Dannan O’Meachair, Onto provides an accessible, flexible and simple way for motorists to take the electric vehicle driving wheel. Operating with a subscription-based business model, Onto enables people to sign up for an electric car on a monthly contract. What’s more, the subscription is inclusive of public charging, insurance and breakdown cover, without any upfront deposit or long-term commitment – making it an enticing deal for any motorist out there. The UK-based company prioritises car usership rather than ownership, which is a disruptive step forward in the EV space. It means that drivers have more choice and flexibility over the car they drive, but it also makes it more affordable. Electric vehicles are well-known to be the best choice for the future, and with the enhanced tech, they now also offer a great driving experience for petrol-heads alike. However, they have remained the pricey option when it comes to purchasing. Onto removes this barrier through a subscription approach that is inclusive of all the extra costs having a car can bring up. Onto has also streamlined the entire user experience by making its platform a digital one. From signing up and booking a car online to having it delivered to your doorstep within just a few days, the whole process is smooth and simple. Rob Jolly, CEO and Co-Founder, explained: “A recent EY Consumer Index study showed 49% of car buyers want an electric vehicle as their next car, with upfront costs and concerns about charging seen as the most significant barriers for first time EV buyers. With almost 90% of our customers preferring the convenience of an all-inclusive package that covers everything – even public charging – our unique proposition addresses these customers’ needs with a choice of 18 car models. Onto takes the hassle and effort out of getting an EV. We believe that making it simple and easy to get an electric car is essential to building a sustainable future.” The market Onto is tapping into a market with massive growth potential. Moving to more sustainable ways of life is a key priority for governments across Europe as ambitions to reach ent zero need to be met, and soon. This, coupled with the specific plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 (in the UK, but similar plans exist across Europe), consumers are increasingly looking for ways to make the switch. In the UK alone, sustainable mobility businesses are growing at a mega-pace – reportedly more than 500% than last year. This is despite the global semiconductor chip shortage. Wian Pieterse, Managing Director, Fintech at Legal & General, said: “At Legal & General we’re committed to playing our part in tackling the climate crisis and investing with purpose into companies that do good. Onto is an exciting example of this; an ambitious company with a talented management team that will play a vital role in accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. We expect to see increasing demand for subscription models that not only pave the way towards a sustainable way of living but also meet the needs of those who don’t want to tie up valuable savings or incur a loan to buy a car. Onto has grown rapidly over the last four years, and we’re looking forward to working with the team to help the business scale and expand into new markets, all while investing to benefit the future of our society”. The funding Fueling the startup’s ambitions to lead the EV subscription market, this Series C funding was led by Legal & General. Existing investors including Alfvén & Didrikson, Accelerated Digital Ventures, Cerebrum Tech Limited, and the family office of Jim O’Neill participated in the round. Onto has now raised approximately €325 million. The funding will be used to launch the product across Europe, beginning with Germany in 2023, as the team look to accelerate electric car adoption in mainland Europe, and secure its position as the go-to brand for those looking to make the switch to electric. The company already has an office in Germany and welcomed their newly appointed Managing Director of Germany, Joerg Feldheim. Rob Jolly added: “This funding round is a huge milestone for Onto as it sets us off on our journey to Europe. Germany, a nation with an incredible automotive history as Europe’s biggest car-producing country, is a market with huge potential and a great appetite for electric cars. We’re excited to offer something different.”"

2022.7.28,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/danish-agtech-agreena-acquires-hummingbird-technologies-to-push-forward-global-farmings-green-transition/,"Today, Copenhagen-based Agreena has announced its acquisition of UK-based Hummingbird Technologies. It’s a move that reflects the influence that tech startups are having in fueling the green transition and sustainability across Europe. Carbon offsetting and reaching more sustainable approaches to all aspects of life is now firmly on the agenda across the world. The farming and agriculture sector is seen as one of the largest polluters of carbon, and one of the industries that need tech approaches to fuel the green transition. Copenhagen-based Agreena is one of Europe’s pioneering platforms facilitating the issuing and trading of carbon certificates. It’s just acquired Hummingbird Technologies – a UK-based firm providing advanced remote sensing analytics to improve the sustainability of the agri-food sector. The two companies have collaborated together in the past, with his new deal coming as an aligned strategic move. With this new chapter in their partnership, Agreena puts key resources – financial and commercial – into the development of Hummingbird’s MRV (monitoring, reporting & verification) technology, a crucial innovation that helps create trustworthiness around soil carbon certificates. Agreena: A growing marketplace Founded in 2018, Agreena started out life as a digital trading platform, intended to make grains trading more democratic and efficient. It has grown to become one of the first platforms across Europe to facilitate issuing and trading of carbon certificates for farmers and is now serving 13 countries in Europe. The AgreenaCarbon programme follows the crop year and thus allows the farmers to reap the value of their climate efforts on an annual basis. Having access to carbon reporting tools and certificates is a crucial part of farmers being able to take necessary and relevant climate action, each doing their part to help Europe’s green transition. The Copenhagen-based startup is supporting farmers’ transition to regenerative agriculture – made by farmers and fintech experts for farmers. Hummingbird Technologies: Regenerative agriculture Since 2016, Hummingbird Technologies has been enabling regenerative agriculture through data science. The AI-based SaaS platform uses deep learning and computer vision techniques along with proprietary algorithms to provide actionable insights to farmers and agri-businesses. It provides advanced remote sensing data to help farmers identify early problems in crops, such as crop health, disease risk and detection, weed mapping, yield prediction, and more. It’s, therefore, able to give the agriculture industry much-needed tools to optimise processes whilst minimizing environmental impacts. The platform was developed by Will Wells with this vision – to alleviate the climate burden of intensive farming and food production through tech. Alexander Jevons, CEO of Hummingbird Technologies: “Hummingbird and Agreena were early pioneers in what is now a thriving regenerative agriculture economy. Our complementary technologies have enabled this market to take off, and as such, this is the perfect match. Our companies’ partnership-turned-marriage is a natural progression in a maturing and fastgrowing industry and a great step forward for society and farmers, who can sell the certificates and thus finance their green transition.” The Acquisition It’s a merger that strengthens Agreena’s value chain, underlining the company’s international leading position within the agricultural sector for soil carbon certification. Merging the two companies’ technology capabilities and bringing Hummingbird’s AI-based verification in-house to Agreena is just the beginning and jointly, the teams will be delivering innovative new tech solutions for the agriculture industry and soil carbon markets. Simon Haldrup, co-founder and CEO of Agreena: “Agreena is on a mission to enable an international regenerative agriculture movement, and this market-leading MRV solution can deliver a massive scalable impact. We have been thoroughly investigating advanced technology solutions and working towards enhancing our protocol since day one – and with this acquisition, we are not only scaling, but also adding new tech perspectives to the development of agriculture.” The purchase will result in a company with more than 80 combined employees. Agreena has been operating its soil carbon program in 13 countries throughout the pan-European market, and the new acquisition will build its operational capacity to the Americas and Australia."
2022.7.28,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/bristol-based-condense-lands-e4-4-million-to-bring-live-events-into-the-metaverse/,"Bristol-based startup Condense is on a mission to deliver the authenticity and connectivity of real-world events into the metaverse. The young team has just picked up €4.4 million and has opened a world-first metaverse studio. The metaverse boom has brought about lots of fresh innovation and futuristic technology. Bringing the real world into the digital sphere, and doing so whilst maintaining the power, connection and immersive quality of live events, Condense is transforming how music, sports and ‘in-person’ events are experienced. Founded in 2019, the startup has just picked up a €4.4 million capital boost to do so in addition to opening a pioneering metaverse studio. Condenses CEO and co-founder Nick Fellingham: “The Bristol scene has long been a world-renowned melting pot of different cultures and music and, in the last few years, it’s become a hub for games development too. Now we’re going to put Bristol on the map once again with the world’s first metaverse live streaming studio to bring together the energy of live events with the massive scale of the metaverse. The Video 3.0 infrastructure we’ve built takes out the technical complexity of streaming live into the metaverse, so people are free to put their creativity in Video. 3.0 is going to change not just how we experience live events online, but fundamentally how we engage with each other.” The Funding LocalGlobe led the €4.4 million round, 7percent Ventures and Deeptech Labs, alongside angels including a platinum-selling grime artist, former England footballer and sports presenter, Tom Blomfield (Monzo), renowned music manager Grace Ladoja MBE and Ian Hogarth (Song Kick). It’ll be used to accelerate commercial relationships with artists, labels, content creators and metaverse platforms, furthering the vision of bringing real-life into the metaverse age. Metaverse Tech The Bristol-based startup is at the forefront of emerging metaverse tech. It’s developed end-to-end capture and streaming technology to live stream real-world events like music and sports events into 3D applications. The company uses cutting-edge computer vision, machine learning and proprietary streaming infrastructure to capture and embed live 3D video (Video 3.0) into any metaverse game, mobile app or platform created with Unity or Unreal Engine. It means that true-to-life live performances can be streamed directly into the virtual worlds and games platforms used by billions of people worldwide – without the need for VR headsets. Because the events are streamed live as three-dimensional “real-world” video, every player’s perspective is as unique and dynamic as if they were at a physical live event – and their experience is just as memorable. Andrew Gault, founding partner of 7percent ventures said: “When I invested in Oculus nearly 10 years ago, the dream was to deliver experiences that seamlessly merge the digital and the physical. Condense has now made that possible inside all video games and platforms, without the need for VR headsets. What they have built is already a reality and it’s going to change the way the whole world engages online.” It’s certainly a new era for events and experiences, and it’ll be interesting to see how it catches on. The atmosphere of attending concerts and sports events is what makes the in-person aspect so special, so the fact Condense is claiming to be able to replicate this is quite impressive. It’s been stated by the company that using Video3.0 can give fans an enhanced true-to-life experience. They can attend gigs or sporting events with friends, with the freedom to move among the virtual crowds and get up close to the action. Because performances are live, fans can interact with the artist – a digital step forward from holding a banner at a gig – and artists can respond in real-time, giving shout-outs, answering questions or performing a requested track. Ziv Reichert, partner at LocalGlobe said: “Hundreds of millions of people are hanging out in immersive 3D platforms like Roblox, Rec Room, Fortnite, Sandbox, Decentraland and VRChat; attending virtual events, socialising and being creative. At the same time, player demand for live entertainment inside these virtual worlds has never been greater. Condense has built the infrastructure to connect the two – now music artists, sports stars and creatives can perform and play live in the metaverse, to the largest stadium audience imaginable.” The Studio In addition to the funding, Condense has also opened a pioneering metaverse studio in partnership with Watershed – Bristol’s cultural cinema and creative technology venue – to give established artists and emerging talent access to the technology. The studio is a “metaverse-first” event space, and can also accommodate a live audience. In partnership with another organisation, a London studio will soon open followed by other studios internationally. With Condense, broadcasting live in three dimensions to the metaverse is as natural and easy as performing in front of a conventional camera, with no need for green screens or post-production, allowing for an immediate connection with the audience in real-time. Bristol-based vocalist and producer Grove, who was among the first artists to pioneer Condense technology, said: “The minds behind the technology are pushing the boundaries of tech-informed performance sharing. This is great for accessibility and opens up exciting new opportunities for fans to connect with their favourite artists”. Grace Ladoja MBE, co-founder of METALLIC INC and renowned artist manager said: “Culture and community are what drives music forward. It’s how we connect with where we’ve come from and where we want to go. Condense’s technology is opening up a new platform for these communities and cultures, diversifying the voices in the metaverse by making it live and accessible. It’s got the potential to inspire and empower a new movement of artists and fans. This is both exciting, and significant.” What’s next Taking its futuristic tech to the next step, this capital boost will be used to accelerate commercial relationships with artists, labels, content creators and metaverse platforms, expanding the startup’s reach and presence in the market. As it is also today opening its metaverse studio, it is now developing an international network of streaming studios to capture and broadcast Video 3.0 live into the metaverse. Miles Kirby, CEO of Deeptech Labs said: “The metaverse requires a new infrastructure, much of it breaking new ground and requiring next-generation machine learning and machine vision. Condense has the deeptech experience and vision to make the metaverse the number one destination for live events.”"
2022.7.28,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/digital-health-startup-ilof-secures-e4-89-million-to-accelerate-personalised-drug-discovery/,"Based between Oxford and Lisbon, iLoF is a biotech startup on a mission to make a difference in the world. The company is developing a platform that creates improved access to personalised medicine for the millions of people around the world living with complex diseases. The development of medicines and treatments has generally been done thinking of the general population, with the expectation that they will work for everyone. However, any medical scientist will be able to confirm that this is not the case. Each person is different and so each person reacts to treatments differently. A general approach to developing medicines, therefore, means that many people are left behind. For example, with severe diseases such as Alzheimer’s multiple factors can contribute to the effectiveness o a treatment on a given patient. It means that millions of people currently live without access to an effective disease-modifying treatment. This reality sparked the creation of iLoF. The Funding Based in both Porto and Lisbon, the biotech startup is revolutionising approaches to future healthcare. This new capital injection is comprised of about €4 million dollars in equity investment led by Faber, alongside US-based M12, Microsoft’s venture fund and Quiet Capital, and EU-based Lunar Ventures, Alter Venture Partners, re.Mind Capital and Fluxunit, the corporate VC arm of ams OSRAM. Angel investor Charlie Songhurst, former GM at Microsoft, and Berggruen Holdings, the family office of Nicolas Berggruen, a serial investor and philanthropist, also participated. This is alongside a grant of about €880k from ERDF. Sofia Santos, Partner at Faber, commented: “iLoF has the potential to positively impact millions of patients around the globe and become an integral part of the $500B global personalized medicine market. Its unique combination of photonics and artificial intelligence can both directly impact the fast-growing AI in Drug Discovery Market and transform the diagnosis, staging, and triage of a myriad of diseases, progressively moving healthcare from a central hospital based-approach into a low-cost, distributed, patient-driven approach.” iLoF: Creating a digital library of biomarkers Founded in 2019, iLoF has developed a digital library of disease biomarkers and biological profiles, and it is enabling biotechs and pharmaceutical companies to make clinical trials faster, cheaper and more patient-centric. The platform pulls together massive amounts of data to build a library of biological profiles, bringing together world-class physicists, biologists, and data scientists to get life-saving personalized treatments to patients faster. Luis Valente, Co-Founder and CEO, explained: “We collect vast amounts of data to create digital twins of biological profiles and disease subtypes, which we store in our digital library. Different patient profiles can be selected and screened using our platform to speed up the development of effective and personalized treatments while enabling humane, patient-centric clinical trials.” The platform amasses a wide range of optical signals, creating rich signatures of the ensemble of particles on biological samples, which are then converted into bio-digital twins. These bio-digital twins overcome the traditional limits of biochemical analysis, in which they can be re-analyzed a potentially infinite number of times. This supercharges the search for emergent features and patterns that could be the key to developing various novel therapeutics. During the pandemic, iLoF worked with St. John’s Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine in Porto to understand how the platform could help manage the influx of COVID-19 patients and optimize resources. iLoF was shown to be able to accurately distinguish COVID-19 patients based on their likelihood of ICU admission, which could allow hospitals to manage critical resources more effectively. The pandemic perfectly highlighted the need for a more personalised approach to drug discovery – and iLoF is bringing a revolutionary approach. This is something that Priyanka Mitra, investor at M12, Microsoft’s venture fund, has highlighted: “In the midst of the accelerated pace of change brought on by the global pandemic, the need for personalized medicine solutions that serve each patient’s individual needs has never been more pressing. iLoF’s cloud-based library of optical fingerprints is world-class technology built by an outstanding team that will help us usher in this new era of personalized patient care and healthcare delivery.” Led by CEO Luis Valente, COO Mehak Mumtaz and CSO Paula Sampaio, iLoF was initially formed while participating in EIT Health’s Wild Card programme and accelerated at the Oxford Foundry. The team currently consists of 20 international scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors. The plans Mehak Mumtaz, Co-Founder and COO of iLoF: “Our ultimate vision is to go from a next-generation bioinformatics platform to a breakthrough disease screening one. Moving from supporting researchers and scientists to directly helping patients around the world will vastly deepen our understanding of diseases and help physicians detect the world’s more severe and impactful diseases, such as Ovarian Cancer or Alzheimer’s Disease.” Having effectively demonstrated the value and importance of the iLoF platform, the startup is now wanting to scale up its operations. The Seed funding will be used to accelerate ongoing engagements with leading global corporations in the Pharmaceutical, Biotech, and Clinical space, with the aim of fast-tracking current and future pilots, enabling the further development of the iLoF Platform. Speaking on the investment in iLoF, Elad Verbin, Partner at Lunar Ventures, added: “iLoF embodies the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionise healthcare as we know it. We are incredibly excited to back iLoF’s team of biologists, laser physicists and data scientists as they teach a computer how human blood looks at the nano-scale when affected by cancer or Alzheimer’s. Humanity urgently needs access to cheap, painless point-of-care diagnostics, and optical technology and machine learning are finally advanced and strong enough to provide this. iLoF is a frontrunner in leveraging these new optics and machine learning capabilities, providing an accurate early screening platform that improves the lives of tens of millions.” Before 2023, iLoF will also be hiring 20 people internationally across physics, data science, biology, and product management profiles. Most recently, the company hired Alex Turpin as Head of BioSignal and Analytics, an experienced physicist who spent the last decade leading projects at the interface of AI, Data Science, and Photonics in world-class institutions around Europe."
2022.7.28,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/swiss-insurtech-startup-grape-picks-up-e1-7-million-to-reinvent-employee-insurance/,"Today, Swiss startup grape has announced a raise of €1.7 million to reimagine insurance for employees. The insurtech is making processes more efficient and streamlined for HR teams and giving employees improved services. Employee insurance is a standard for companies’ benefit packages across the world. It’s something that employees now anticipate having access to, yet, while it’s a massive market, it’s one ripe for innovation and disruption. Much of the current providers are lagging behind in terms of digitalisation and tech-enablement. Enter grape, the Swiss insurtech provider that aims to become a health partner and support all-over physical and mental wellbeing. Gregory Inauen, Co-founder of grape: “grape is the first employee insurer built around a full-stack technology platform and a relentless focus on being more than just an insurance” The funding Grape has today announced a pre-Seed funding round of €1.7 million for its fresh approach to the insurance sector. The round was led by Swiss venture capital firm Wingman Ventures, with participation from the FinTech funds Tomahawk.VC and DD Venture Capital. Grape: the neoinsurer for employee insurance Founded in 2021 by Gregory Inauen and Fabian Mächler, grape provides digital employee insurance to enterprise customers. The insurance packages are bundled with a B2B SaaS product that saves the insured companies time managing their coverages and claims. The startup is also committed to improving services for employees themselves, and so directly reinvests into prevention services supporting the health of their customer’s employees through their benefits and paid therapy sessions – one of the first insurers to do so. The Zurich-based team has developed a product that is streamlining insurance processes for HRteams, taking away a headache that has been felt for a long time. The product operates with a variety of automation that reduce administrative burdens – such as claiming, reporting, and payroll adjustments. So far, grape has built over 20 integrations into different HR tools which can be synced within seconds with their platform. All the employees that are covered with grape can access a wide range of benefits, coaching and therapy sessions to improve their physical and mental health. It’s a product, therefore, that is making life easier for companies, offers an attractive benefits package, and takes holistic care of employees’ wellbeing. Lukas Weder, Founding Partner of Wingman Ventures stated: “The Insurtech world finds itself still in its early days. However, the insurance sector is one of the largest industries globally that now shows clear signs that new massive businesses can emerge. Grape’s approach to fully digitizing and automating the underwriting and claims handling process by integrating their technology into their customer’s processes is precisely what insurance customers expect from the next generation of insurance products.” What’s next The insurance market is lucrative. And, as more companies add insurance packages as part of perks and benefits packages, it’s one that is continuing to grow. It’s also one that is in need of fresh innovation, bringing products and solutions into the digital age for a new generation of workers. It’s reported that the group insurances for health, accident and life reached a market size of around €5 trillion in 2021. Meanwhile, a few massive massive insurance giants dominate most companies’ employee benefits packages, and they’re now grape’s main competitors. The big giants are considerably lagging behind. Much of the work in this sector is still done manually, through paperwork and phone calls which leads to delays, mistakes and transparency. Traditional insurers do not only waste time and money managing their sick-leave policies, accident claims and pension plans, but through all these manual processes they also lack data to improve their underwriting and are mainly focused on fighting claims rather than preventing them in the first place. Grape is using tech not only to streamline processes but to prevent problems and inefficiencies from arising in the first place. The aim is to go beyond merely insurance provision, but also be a health partner that supports mental and physical wellbeing from the very beginning, preventing leave, burnout and lost costs. The new funding will be used to continue expanding the product and grow the team further, to bring its vision to more enterprises and more markets."
2022.7.29,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/manchester-based-linkup-scores-over-e530k-to-help-people-connect-in-the-digital-era/,"Linkup, the social app from Manchester, has just secured over €530k in its mission to bring people closer together via tech. The startup will launch its app in Q4 of this year after securing this funding. There are many things to be grateful for in the digital era. Tech has changed our lives in many ways, and mostly for the better, but, one thing many people are missing out on is in-person social connection. The pandemic highlighted to many the importance of in-person socializing and it also exacerbated what has been described as a loneliness crisis amongst all generations – from millennials up to boomers. Aiming to revolutionize socializing in the digital era, using tech to promote social connection rather than detract from it, Manchester-based Linkup has developed a social app and will launch in Q4 this year after a pre-seed fundraise of over €530k. The funding The app has gained attention from a variety of key early investors, including famous Youtubers, footballers and music artists. It’s clear that the app, which advocates socializing, fighting loneliness and connecting people, proved potent to investors. Renowned music duo Krept & Konen are among the investors, along with Callum Airey (Calfreezy on YouTube. Casyo ‘Krept’ Johnson, one half of duo Krept & Konan and an early Linkup investor said: “When I saw what Linkup was doing I was immediately interested. It’s very unique and no one else is connecting people simply and quickly in this way. I truly believe what they’re building is going to be a game changer. I saw how I could use this personally but also professionally as an artist. The applications are endless, hence the huge size of the opportunity. This is why I decided to personally invest and help support the business!” Connecting people through tech Founded by Jack Peagam and Ben Whatson, Linkup has been developed with an impact-driven mission – to help people develop relationships and connect in person during a time where technology is a strong pillar of society. The founders have both seen the way young people’s mental health has steadily declined in recent years and were determined to create a fun and exciting app that connects people together over common interests and hobbies. They both recognised that post-pandemic socializing keeps people locked in the digital space, with mobile phones a permanent fixture in your life. Linkup encourages users to put down their phones, meet like-minded people around them and focus on today, in the moment that counts. Co-founder Jack Peagam said, “The pandemic hit everyone hard, and it was daunting to meet new people once restrictions were lifted, let alone taking into account how reliant most generations are now on their digital screens! After two years of social distancing, people are still struggling to develop new friendships, get to know new cities they’ve moved to, or even discover new hobbies. We wanted to create something that actively supports users to get back out into the real world, go on adventures, and do more of what they love. This investment has brought our business vision to life and supported us to build the fundamentals of the app and we can’t wait to launch Linkup to the public later this year.” It’s a platform that enables any kind of meeting in-person, for any kind of person – forge friendships, discover fellow hobbyists or just go for a drink with someone nearby. It’s an app that puts users in the driver’s seat of their own spontaneous adventures whilst putting safety at the forefront of every connection. In the mission to solve the problem of people living with one-dimensional digital connections and bring them back to the real world, to encourage living in the moment, the Linkup app will launch in September. Linkup joined forces with UK-based App Development firm Tappable, to develop the app from the ground up. With a focus on user experience, the app can be navigated with ease, creating a seamless way for users to swipe through different types of linkups from sociable drinks to a game of tennis. Users can simply request to join a linkup, and once the creator accepts they’ll be added to the linkup group chat, which features all the event details, including the specific location, with integrated safety features."

The Belarus-founded startup is aiming to disrupt the sector through its cost-effective and easy-to-use product. The funding was led by Flyer One Ventures with the support of Yury Mazanik, founder of Belka Games. Founded in 2022, Peech converts any texts, files, pictures, or web pages into audiobooks. Users simply scan the content they need to be converted, and then they can listen to it as if it were an audiobook all along. Given that audio is growing in popularity as an easy way to digest content, Peech provides a simple way for people to enjoy articles whilst going about their daily lives. Led by experienced tech specialists from Eastern Europe Andrey Poznyak and Alex Gorbel, and qualified marketing executive and product manager Bahram Ismailov, the app is taking on a big market. Content consumption is rapidly growing and audio is becoming the poster-boy format. Listening to the news rather than reading it, hearing about an opinion rather than turning pages in a magazine and getting lost in a story whilst out on a jog is now what many consumers want – and Peech is offering it. Andrey Poznyak, co-founder of Peech, explained: ‘’Knowledge is the main resource of our time, and projects that simplify the process of obtaining it will always be relevant. Due to the development of technology, the share of the use of audio interfaces is greatly increasing, and there is still a lot of potential here. At the moment the application is available in more than 60 languages, and we will improve the product to make it more convenient for the development of the audience.” After taking time to consider what core features needed to be included, based on the founders’ own personal desire for such a product, Peech launched this year and can read documents, recognize text in photos, recommend articles, and much more. It also includes Peech AI which collects and voices the most useful articles from the best publishers like Wired, Observer, Harvard Business Review, Vanity Fair, Medium, The Economist, The Washington Post, The New York Times, Bloomberg, BBC, Business Insider, and many others. That provides an opportunity to consume high-quality content on a variety of topics: Parenthood, Venture Capital, Marketing, Healthy Nutrition, Financial Markets, Travel, etc. In other words, it is like Spotify for useful texts. The app has already picked up attention. During February-May, more than 11000 hours of unique content were voiced. It is popular amongst generations and cohorts of people. From doctors to students, it provides a service for anyone who likes or needs to consume content in a practical audio format. The app is now available in 50+ languages, and that number is only growing. Further, the team’s videos have managed to rack up more than 2.4 million views and the app has around 2k paying customers – and this has been achieved with a very small marketing budget. Now, with this funding boost, the team want to bring Peech to new markets, with the USA and Western Europe as primary targets. The startup also wants to develop the product further, grow the team and focus. Vital Laptenok, General Partner at Flyer One Ventures, commented: “The growth of audio content consumers has been on a constant upward trajectory for the past few years. In the U.S. alone, 73% of the population listens to online audio monthly, which is only increasing. The rise in demand for audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio formats indicates that audio will be more popular than reading. Therefore, we see huge potential in Peech’s product and are happy to support the team in their efforts to develop a culture of consuming useful content in the audio format’’."
2022.7.29,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/only-the-players-with-the-best-tech-and-a-unique-proposition-survive-in-the-end-interview-with-hokodo/,"The payments sector has undergone a lot of change in the past few years. From a movement away from cash and the BNPL boom, it’s a space full of innovation and exciting new developments. Fintech startups are very much at the forefront of driving this innovation and fueling the payment transformation. One such startup is Hokodo – a pan-European B2B BNPL provider shaking things up since 2018. From its London headquarters, Hokodo is active in France, Spain, the Netherlands and beyond – and they’re expanding fast. Founders Richard Thornton, Louis Carbonnier and Sami Ben Hatit are on a mission to modernise the way businesses buy from each other by making it easier and safer to sell to business customers. The startup raised an impressive €37.8 million in June this year to double down its efforts to become the B2B BNPL category leader in continental Europe. We chatted to Louis to find out more about Hokodo, what makes them stand out from the crowd, and what’s next for the BNPL space. A lot has been happening in the Buy Now Pay Later payment sphere in the last few years. What distinguishes Hokodo from the rest of the BNPL providers, and what are the main advantages for the small B2B e-commerce buyer? There are three key factors differentiating Hokodo from other B2B BNPL providers. The first is that our proprietary tech, credit and analytics stack was built and continues to operate in-house. We have no reliance on third parties, meaning we can make decisions quicker and accept more buyers at a faster rate. Ours is the only BNPL solution that meets all requirements of B2B merchants, including credit scoring, fraud detection, payments, collections, financing and credit insurance. Merchants benefit from an end-to-end solution with maximum flexibility, latency and uptime. The second differentiator is that Hokodo is the only B2B BNPL provider with a truly international footprint – we’re currently operational in the UK, France, Spain, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Hokodo is a pan-European business with offices in London and Paris, and remote employees all over Europe. Meanwhile, our competitors are all restricted to just one or two locations. This ability to reach customers across Europe gives us a key competitive edge and is especially pertinent to marketplaces which need to do pay-ins/pay-outs in different geographies/currencies. The third thing separating Hokodo from many other BNPL providers is the fact that we guarantee payment in full upon delivery of goods. Merchants benefit from full protection against the risk of non-payment and thus the opportunity to channel their energy and cash into business growth. The main advantages for buyers – other than the obvious benefit of being able to defer payment and improve cash flow – are also threefold. First is all around the seamlessness of our solution. There are no tedious forms to print, fill out and send off, and buyers are able to access credit terms instantly, even on their first purchase. The second key advantage for buyers is simple: there are no fees or costs associated with using our BNPL solution. And, finally, buyers are able to access tailored support when they need it. We support buyers at each step of their journey, whether they’re at the checkout, have questions about their credit eligibility, or need help completing their payment. Was Hokodo based on a pain any of the founders had in previous positions? Or was it an opportunity that you identified and decided to develop? Yes, in a way. Richard (Thornton, co-founder and co-CEO) and I had been working together for several years in the embedded finance space, helping big banks and insurers to sell financial services at the point of need. Then I joined Euler Hermes, the global leading provider of trade credit insurance i.e., the insurance against unpaid invoices. This product is great for supporting credit terms but it suffers from two major shortcomings. First is the fact that it’s a very complex product, meaning that only large corporations with sophisticated finance departments can access it, usually through brokers. Paradoxically, the SMEs who would benefit the most from protection against bad debt are not able to access this product, thereby creating a massive insurance and financing gap! Second is that it’s a product designed for traditional offline trade. It works on a 48-hour cycle which means that it can’t support the reality of e-commerce, where buyers need real-time answers to support an instant and seamless checkout. As I became increasingly excited about this opportunity, I was joined by Sami (Ben Hatit, co-founder and CTO) to prototype some BNPL APIs and then had a beer with Richard who was also grappling with the red tape of corporate life. At first Richard didn’t believe that an opportunity like B2B BNPL hadn’t already been capitalised on. But after many days of research, we concluded that it had not yet been invented, and, with Sami on board, the idea to build Hokodo was born. How does Hokodo streamline the payment and the collection experience for the B2B e-commerce shop owner? Unlike many of the BNPL providers out there, Hokodo meets all requirements of B2B merchants. This means that there’s one provider taking care of the entire process from the checkout, through credit scoring and fraud detection, to financing, payment and collections. Merchants don’t have to spend time and money on the resource-heavy processes of conducting credit checks on all their buyers and chasing debt from late payers, as we do all the leg work for them. This frees up resources to be spent on what really matters – business growth.” How much have you raised in investment rounds so far? Can you tell us an indication on which verticals you spend those funds – is it more on product development, team or marketing? Just last month we announced a $40 million Series B fundraise led by Notion Capital. We’re planning to use this new funding in a few key ways. Firstly, we will continue our geographic expansion across Europe. To date we’ve taken our BNPL solution to 6 European countries. Secondly, we will invest in new BNPL products for instore and telesales transactions. Thirdly – and the first two points help feed into this – we will use our new funding to fulfil our mission of enabling 1 million businesses to access a better way to pay by 2025. One year prior to this announcement we raised a $12.5 million Series A round, and before that a seed round of €2.2 million. In our early days we were also awarded a €2 million Horizon 2020 grant from the European Union’s Innovation Council. Hokodo´s internal credit decision engine makes decisions instantly. It also developed APIs so that partners can onboard the solution in their platforms. What is your view on the API economy – and do you think paytech will be more and more going towards aggregation? In recent years we’ve seen lots of B2C marketplaces and e-commerce sites turn to various forms of embedded finance in order to satisfy the various financial needs of their customers in the most streamlined way possible. Think about embedded payment options like digital wallets and PayPal alongside the more traditional methods like credit cards and direct debit; embedded lending options such as Buy Now, Pay Later; and embedded insurance products, such as those found on airline or events tickets websites. These embedded financial tools are all options that we, as consumers, are used to seeing and using at the point of purchase, and they’re now becoming popular in B2B trade also. Often, these tools are connected to the marketplace or e-commerce site checkout using APIs. Because of the way embedded finance works – coming in at the point of need and piggy-backing another buyer journey – online checkouts have become a key place to introduce ancillary services. In other words, payments have become the entry point for lots of additional financial services, which are served to customers right when they need them. Therefore, paytech is growing in importance and is gradually embedding more and more services. Take the example of Hokodo. Most buyers only see the BNPL payment method. However, under the hood, we aggregate many services. In order to manage deferred payments, we need to provide: instant credit checks, fraud detection, collections, insurance against non payments (aka credit insurance) and financing. All these services are actually standalone products in the offline world. We chose to rebuild some of these building blocks in house (such as the credit decision engine) and partnered with third parties for some other blocks (we’re a Lloyd’s coverholder and our products are backed by SCOR, the 4th largest reinsurer in the world). At the end of the day, Hokodo exists at the intersection of paytech, insurtech and lendtech.” Can you tell us about your plans for the future of the startup? Where do you think Hokodo will be in 3 years? Hokodo’s mission is to enable 1 million businesses to access a better way to pay by 2025. So far, 32,000 businesses have already benefited from our Buy Now, Pay Later solution, so in 3 years I hope we will have achieved our current mission and be gearing up to help even more B2B buyers and sellers. Ultimately, we envision a world in which every company has access to the financial tools they need to buy, sell and do more. What is the one piece of advice you would give to fintech founders about the BNPL space? We’ve seen a lot of saturation followed by consolidation in the B2C BNPL space in recent years. Only the players with the best tech and a unique proposition survive in the end. So, my advice for any fintech founders entering the BNPL space is to ensure that you invest in your credit, analytics and tech stack, and make sure that the product you’re taking to market has a unique edge which pushes it to the top of the pack. At the end of the day, any fool can lend money, the hard bit is to recover it and make sustainable profits throughout the whole credit cycle.”"

2022.7.29,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/07/portuguese-impact-finance-platform-goparity-smashes-crowdfunding-target-in-its-mission-to-support-sustainability-innovation/,"Lisbon-based GoParity reached its crowdfunding target of €1.2 million in just one hour and is now accepting ‘overfunding’ – inviting the community to become a shareholder. The fintech startup is empowering people and companies to use their money for good and is scaling fast. Founded in 2017, GoParity is a pioneering impact finance platform, empowering users to put their money into projects and innovations that are bringing about positive change. The startup opened up an equity crowdfunding round this week and hit its €1.2 million target in just one hour. The round was led by the European impact investment fund Mustard Seed Maze (MSM). Given the high demand to participate in the funding, the goal has been raised and the platform is now accepting ‘overfunding’ as it opens up to community investors. Impact Investing Platform Bringing together social and environmental impact projects looking for funding with people who want to invest in sustainability, the goal is to create a ‘green bank’. At the start of the year, we reported on GoParity’s impressive year and identified the main goals for the year ahead. Since then, the team has been busy, helping users invest in sustainability across sectors such as health, eco-fashion, electric mobility, renewable energy, sustainable aquaculture, and education. The Lisbon-headquartered platform has now gathered together a community of 24k users and has funded about 200 impact projects in several countries around the world, across Europe, South America and Africa. Nuno Brito Jorge, CEO, commented: “We’re fully convinced that a purpose and collaboration-driven company like us will do much better if it is partly owned by the community it serves.” The Funding Whilst GoParity itself is an investment platform, this time round it was looking for capital to support its growth. The crowdfunding campaign was held on Crowdcube and the target was smashed. Now open to the community, any individual or company can buy shares from 11€. As investments roll in, it’s clear that there is a high level of support and belief in the platform. One particularly interesting thing to note is that 32% of the investors are women. GoParity has to date raised over €1.2 million from private investors (including Mustard Seed Maze (MSM) and Critical Software), business angels, backers and prizes. Future Plans The Portuguese startup’s mission is to democratize sustainable finance. By inviting customers and partners to become shareholders and have a say in the future of the company, Goparity aims to lead by example. After the launch of its new app last month at a private event in Lisbon, Goparity now intends to invest in expanding across Europe and Canada and in developing the product by adding new ways to save money and invest. To do this, it will grow the team and is hiring for marketing, development, risk and operations. “We want to bring impact finance to everyday life so everyone can, in every investment, account or transaction be sure that they’re using their money for good.”"
2022.8.1,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/taiwan-is-calling-applications-are-now-open-for-the-2035-e-mobility-global-demo-day-sponsored/,"Taiwan is globally renowned for its place in the high-tech and automotive parts manufacturing industries. It’s a nation that is pioneering the tech of tomorrow that will make a big impact. Reflecting this, Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)—Taiwan’s foremost nonprofit trade-promoting organization has launched 2035 E-Mobility Taiwan last year as a new trade show for the EV and self-driving car ecosystem. The second edition of the show is set to take place on April 12-15, 2023 and is a great opportunity for industry players to both showcase and discover new ideas and solutions for future mobility. What’s in store The future of mobility, of how we move from A to B is a conversation that has governments, businesses and people talking all over the world. Societies want to be more mobile and better connected, and at the same time, we want to reduce carbon footprints and lower the environmental impact of movement. Many countries around the world have also announced plans to ban the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles in the near future, and already many cities have strict rules in place about when and where certain vehicles can go in order to protect air quality and reduce pollution. These factors have created something of an e-mobility boom, and it’s calling for fresh innovation. The main trends we are seeing are the rise of electric vehicles and self-driving cars – and a lot of it is beginning in Taiwan. With a strong foundation and legacy in the semiconductor and ICT industries, advanced manufacturing, and software programming, Taiwan has demonstrated its place as a major supplier in the global high-tech and automotive industries. For example, Taiwan-based companies—including TSMC, TECO, FUKUTA, BizLink, EOI Group, Asia Optical, and CoreMax—are some of the largest providers of Tesla’s components. Meanwhile, Taiwanese manufacturers such as Delta, Pegatron, and Quanta have long been the trusted suppliers for top carmakers in countries like the U.S., Europe, and Japan. It is with this background that TAITRA launches 2035 E-Mobility Taiwan for the EV and self-driving car ecosystem. Along with the trade show, TAITRA and Epoch Foundation—the founder of Garage+, which is known as Asia’s largest zero-equity incubator—co-organize the E-Mobility Global Demo Day, a startup pitch event on the hunt for new ideas and solutions for the mobility sector. Applications are now open. Why you should take part Joining the E-Mobility Global Demo Day is a special chance to turn concepts and ideas into reality. Startups moving to the final round of the competition will receive a subsidy to jet off to Taipei, Taiwan. They will be able to benefit from one-to-one meetings with potential investors and business partners, take part in networking, and, get an exhibit stand in the Future Star Pavilion at the 2035 E-Mobility Taiwan trade show in April 2023. Startups in the final round will also have a chance to pitch at the main stage of the 2035 E-Mobility Taiwan trade show! What’s more exciting than that? It’s definitely not one that any e-mobility innovator wants to miss. Why Taiwan For European entrepreneurs, the thought of going to Taiwan might seem a little distant. But, let’s put that idea to rest. Taiwan has a reputable foundation in the mobility sector, and it’s established itself as one of the manufacturing powerhouses of the world. Its connections to some of the largest and most influential mobility and automotive companies in the world, including Tesla, make it an exciting place for innovative startup founders to check out. The important details The E-Mobility Global Demo Day is on the lookout for startups in the growth stage focusing on the e-mobility segment. Specifically, startups developing innovative solutions for EV and autonomous driving, which promote ESG are encouraged to apply. Applications are open until August 31, 2022 And don’t forget, winners will have the amazing chance to pitch to leading corporations and well-known VCs in the global e-mobility ecosystem on the main stage of the 2035 E-Mobility Taiwan trade show."
2022.8.1,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/london-based-built-ai-picks-up-e2-3-million-to-develop-digital-twin-for-commercial-real-estate-market/,"London-based startup Built AI is bringing data-driven decisions to the lucrative commercial real estate market. Its AI platform is bringing more transparency to investors in the sector and empowering quicker and smarter decisions. The startup just secured about €2.3 million to develop the product further and expand. Commercial real estate in the UK is a trillion-dollar market. It’s one that is well established, lucrative and an investment space that has been seen as relatively secure. There’s not been a lot of ground-breaking shifts in the sector, it’s one that has tended to follow a pretty steady path. However,m aiming to shake it up a little, Built AI aspires to be the next big thing in the market. Bringing big-data transparency to commercial real estate Based in London, Built AI is an AI platform dedicated to the commercial real estate market. It comprises a comprehensive and accurate AI-augmented dataset on UK commercial real estate and its proprietary algorithms are capable of creating granular ‘street level’ insights on any property and location – a massive step forward from the sparsely-populated and disparate datasets that are pervasive in the industry. Built AI’s vision is to create a ‘live’ digital snapshot of the country’s real estate assets that can be used to virtually model investment scenarios across entire portfolios. Increased demand for real-estate assets and significant shifts in the commercial real estate market is making it harder for property firms, funds and landlords to generate Alpha returns. At the same time, the severe lack of data transparency in the commercial property sector means that Built AI’s platform can improve players’ information about new markets and broader consumer trends that would unlock hefty returns on future deals. The startup spun out Founder Factory’s venture studio and is working with a number of customers that have already analysed over €2 billion worth of property assets – including a partnership with Deutsche Finance International, the owners of London Olympia and Europi Property Group. Firoz Noordeen, co-founder of Built AI, said: “Until now, analysing the returns of potential commercial real estate deals has been flawed due to the lack of transparent data available. With the help of this new investment, we can bring the real estate industry into the Google/Deepmind age, using sophisticated machine learning capabilities to fundamentally alter how property investments are evaluated and boost the rate of alpha returns.” The funding The deeptech startup has now raised a fresh €2.3 million. The seed round was led by former Apple/DataTiger executives Philipp Mohr and Puli Liyanagama and supported by MMC Ventures, Plug and Play and an InnovateUK Smart Grant. The funds will be used to fuel BuiltAI’s R&D and product growth – including furthering its AI geospatial analytics and extending its customer acquisition in the UK and Europe. Andrei Dvornic at MMC Ventures added: “MMC is thrilled to be partnering with BuiltAI in its quest to apply state of the art machine learning to enable unprecedented levels of transparency in the real estate market. The team is building category-defining real estate data infrastructure, transforming sparse data sets into granular, precise insights supercharging both transactions and asset management.”"

2022.8.2,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/10-european-sextech-startups-empowering-better-sexual-health-and-wellbeing/,"Digital transformation and major tech breakthroughs are, in many ways, about facilitating an easier, happier life. To that end, there has been an emergence of startups and innovations dedicated to improving human sexual experiences, understanding and awareness – sextech. Sextech is about more than enhancing experiences and pleasure, it’s also about educating society on this crucial part of their health and wellbeing. Given the fact that talking about sex, sexual health and wellbeing are still taboo – especially for women and LGBTQ+ communities – startups are now paving the way to break down barriers and bring the discussion into safer, more open spaces. Sextech is helping to disrupt socially prevailing feelings of shame, embarrassment and guilt around sex, making it a topic that people feel more comfortable and educated to discuss. From enjoying and enhancing sexual experiences to awareness about sexual issues, and even offering support for traumatic and abusive experiences – sextech is an important sector in the health and wellbeing space. Innovation and tech are helping to positively impact how we think about and behave around sex. Not only that, but it’s a massively growing multi-billion euro market, ripe with potential and opportunity, as well as a real chance to positively impact lives. Here, we highlight 10 European startups breaking down barriers, making sextech mainstream and enhancing health and wellbeing for all. Remi Health – Based in Berlin, Remi Health is a fully digital end-to-end clinic for urology and gynaecology. It was founded in 2021 and is growing fast. The startup is on a mission to make STI testing accessible to everyone – regardless of who they are, regardless of their sexual preferences, and regardless of their experiences. It offers laboratory-certified at-home STI Test kits, enabling people to take their sexual health into their own hands, without any feelings of anxiety or shame. People can simply order a kit to be delivered to their home (it’s packaged with discretion in mind), follow the easy sample instructions and then send back the kit. Results are then received via a REMI account with health experts on hand to give any advice needed. Getting STI tested should be a routine procedure for those who are sexually active, yet it remains something neglected – often due to feelings of shame or inaccessibility. Remi is making it easy, boosting overall health and improving lifestyle choices. iPlaySafe – The iPlaySafe app is a startup leveraging technology to improve awareness around the importance of sexual health testing and status. Founded in 2019, the London-based startup integrates tech into STI testing to give users the option to share their status badges with others in a secure medical grade platform. It’s about driving transparency around STIs, reducing the shame and embarrassment that sexual health and testing are associated with and ultimately reducing the number of STIs worldwide by promoting more openness. Users of the app are sent a discreetly packaged checkup box direct to their door. Having collected their sample at their leisure, they return it to the lab using the prepaid shipping label provided. Within two to five days, results are securely sent to their iPlaySafe App® dashboard and they are free to share this information; if, when and with whom they choose. LVNDR Health– Based out of London, LVNDR is a digital healthtech platform that is working to improve sexual wellbeing for LGBTQ+ individuals and modernises existing healthcare options. Founded in 2020, the startup is bringing a much-needed tool to a community that is far underserved in the sexual wellbeing space. Sexual wellbeing, in general, is underserved, and there generally isn’t enough openness and transparency – for the LGBTQ+ community, there is enhanced marginalisation and exclusion. LVNDR is addressing this and using a tech-first purpose-driven approach. LVNDR facilitates access to remote care and empowers users to take control of their health, giving them access to tailored services and features. In 2021, the growing team picked up €1.7 million as part of its vision to reduce social inequalities in healthcare services – starting with sexual health and gender identity care. It also earned its way onto our list featuring EU European startups serving the LGBTQ+ community for its impact-driven approach. Kama – Founded in 2017, Kama is a sexual wellness platform, promoting the science-backed idea that sexual pleasure is health. The London-based startup takes a different approach to wellness and mental wellbeing, advocating that pleasure should be at the forefront of the experience and the priority when it comes to tackling stress – regardless of an individual’s background, sexual preferences, body type, age or gender. The vision is to make sexual satisfaction a part of their everyday lives by connecting their mind, body, and heart. Stress is taking a massive toll on society and is impacting our mental health at an alarming level. Kama wants to shift the focus back to our bodies. The approach gives users a simple daily practice, designed by in-house experts, it combines scientific learnings around neuroplasticity with psychosexual therapy, somatic awareness, and ancient wisdom. The startup has now raised about €3 million. Beducated – Founded in 2018 by Mariah Freya and Phil Steinweber, Beducated has been described as the Netflix of sexual education. The Munich-based startup offers premium online courses that provide a tasteful, contemporary learning experience to light up bedrooms across the globe. We chatted to the couple co-founders in 2020 and they also joined us on our podcast in 2021 to discuss the future of sextech and the importance of breaking down barriers. Beducatd has been one of the pioneers in the sextech space and has taken a revolutionary approach to online sexual education. The platform offers first-class online courses about mindful sex and relationships and delivers them straight into bedrooms all around the world. Now, the startup has empowered individuals with educational content in over 110 countries. The Lowdown – Founded in 2019 in London, The Lowdown is addressing a major gender gap in health – female contraception. Its contraception review, advice and prescriptions platform is aiming to make women’s health less of a minefield – making it more accessible and empowering women to access the best contraceptive options for them. It provides educational content, giving women the lowdown on everything contraception – from the potential side effects to painful periods – and it all comes from a medical team. Too often women struggle to get access to the most appropriate contraceptives, – an experience shared by founder Alice. Contraception has an immense impact on women – their weight, periods, sex drive and skin (to name but a few). Lowdown has been built as the one-stop-shop to give women the ability to choose, access and use the right health care for them. Hanx – Founded in 2017 by two best friends Farah Kabir and Dr Sarah Welsh, HANX is on a mission to smash the stigma around sexual health, championing intimate wellness and encouraging more open conversations. The London-based ecommerce startup has created a range of products that prioritize wellbeing and sustainability – bringing people better experiences through better products. The company takes a sex-positive and anti-awkward approach to the contraception conversation, to encourage people to take it more seriously, and to use cont5aceptives and sexual wellness products that are gynae-designed, stigma-free and free from nasty chemicals. HANX also offers subscription options to its products which include contraceptives and intimate care items. MYHIXEL – Based in Seville, MYHIXEL is a sextech brand focused on male intimate wellness. Sexual wellness and opening up the conversation is one that both men and women need to participate in. While women have historically been shut out of the health space in general, men are also lacking access to quality education on wellness in this sphere. MYHIXEL wants to change this. It’s estimated that about 1 in 10 men has a sex-related issue – but only 20% of men with concerns or problems actually seek help or support. MYHIXEL offers an online sexual health clinic for men, offering a safe and discreet platform for men to have this important conversation. Members have access to sexual wellbeing experts, who provide help in three core areas – clinical consultation, sexual coaching and nutrition & fitness. The startup was founded by Patricia López in 2017. Mojo – Founded in 2017, Mojo is empowering people to manage their fertility proactively, breaking down what can be a very vulnerable and overwhelming topic and giving people the tools to take control. The London-based startup has developed an online fertility care platform that helps users to test, understand and improve their fertility so they can make the most appropriate family-planning decisions. There are plenty of apps helping women to track their fertility cycle, Mojo stands out as it helps men test their sperm – tackling the taboo around male fertility issues. The at-home test allows sperm to be tested discretely and in a more comfortable scenario. Users book a courier to come and pick up the sample – they are given a specific time window – and results are provided within 48 hours. The team advises that they are there to lend a helping hand every step of the way (minus the actual sperm collection) and fertility experts will explain the results in detail as well as provide a detailed and personalized plan to improve sperm standards. Emjoy – Based in Barcelona, Emjoy was founded in 2019 with the vision to normalize female sexual pleasure. The startup earned its way onto our list of Barcelona-based startups to watch in 2021 and has since gone on to feature on our podcast. Emjoy’s mission is to close the gap in sexual empowerment, enabling women to discover their bodies and (re) gain confidence in their sex lives. The platform has a library of over 600 audio sessions and stories, developed by in-house sex therapists and sexual wellbeing experts. It’s all about normalizing female pleasure one audio at a time, with no-frills, real facts and real fun."
2022.8.2,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/estonian-healthtech-startup-antegenes-secures-e2-3-million-to-advance-personalised-cancer-prevention/,"Healthtech startup Antegenes are pioneering a personalised approach to cancer prevention. The innovative company has now raised a total of €2.3 million and is ready to bring its tests to new markets across Europe. Cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly diseases facing society. It’s reported that 1 in 2 people will develop some form of cancer during their lifetime. It’s a condition where cells in a specific part of the body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. The cancerous cells can invade and destroy surrounding healthy tissue, including organs – and there are an estimated 200 different types. The sad reality is that all of us will be impacted at one point – whether directly or indirectly. One of the key ways to tackle cancer and have a chance of overcoming it is prevention. And this is what Antegenes want to advance – developing a personalised cancer prevention test. Personalised Prevention Founded in 2018, Antegenes’ novel genetic tests assess patients’ personal cancer risks and include clinical recommendations for further personalised cancer prevention. Tests are based on innovative polygenic risk score technology which helps to clarify an individual’s genetic predispositions to cancer. It, therefore, allows for more accurate prevention and early detection measures – crucial in the fight against cancer. The tests are currently used to determine the genetic risk to four cancers: breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and skin melanoma. Dr. Peeter Padrik, founder and CEO of Antegenes, explained: “To reduce cancer deaths, the genetic predisposition of cancer should be analysed for all people, and our vision is to implement this internationally with our partners. This is why the current investment round is very important for our growth and next steps. We are glad that investors share our vision of the future of healthcare.” The funding The startup has just raised €2.3 million for its pioneering genetic tests. The Tartu-based startup received €1.6 million from investors in a Seed round which was led by Pipedrive co-founder Timo Rein, Pipedrive’s first investor Peep Vain and entrepreneurs Aare Kurist and Andreas Henn Otsmaa. Other Estonian investors and entrepreneurs participated in the round. The financing round was advised by investment banking company Keystone Advisers and law firm Sorainen. On top of this, Antegenes received two grants to bring research-intensive innovation to international healthcare. The first is from the BRIGHT Project, financed by EIT Health, which supplied €500k to the healthtech team. At the centre of the project is Antegenes and the breast cancer genetic risk test AnteBC. The aim is to implement the AnteBC test in breast cancer precision prevention in Estonia, Portugal and Sweden, with further developments in Europe more broadly. Partners of the project are the University of Tartu, IESE Business School, Tartu University Hospital, Estonian Health Insurance Fund, Uppsala University Hospital, North Lisbon University Hospital Centre, and GE Healthcare. The second grant came from the Norway Grants Green ICT programme, which supports business cooperation between Estonia and Norway. The €200k grant will be used to implement the AnteBC test as part of a breast cancer screening routine in Norway. The partners of the project are the University of Oslo, Oslo University Hospital, Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, and Oslo Cancer Cluster. Dr. Peeter Padrik commented on the future plans with this funding: “The investments make it possible to bring personalised cancer prevention into wider use in healthcare, including in new markets. In addition to Estonia and the United Kingdom, we have started operations in Sweden, Norway, Portugal, and Spain. In the coming months we will also enter the German market.” Lead Investor Timo Rein added: “Antegenes team has been working for a number of years to help people identify and prevent some of the most difficult chronic conditions all of us are potentially subject to during our lifetime. Of course, to realize such a vision one needs to overcome enormous challenges, and we want to support the team as it tackles them. It takes many years to build a great business – and similarly, create a lasting health change – and we believe the current milestone gives a boost to Antegenes team to take some exciting steps towards their future.”"
2022.8.2,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/stockholm-based-bemlo-bags-over-e3-2-million-to-tackle-the-european-healthcare-labour-shortage/,"Getting a capital injection of over €3.2 million, Swedish startup Bemlo is aiming to tackle the growing labour shortage in Europe’s healthcare systems. The company is now aiming to expand into new markets. Across Europe, healthcare systems are under immense pressure. A combination of having to manage a global pandemic, funding gaps and inefficient processes have left the healthcare sector on its knees. As a result, healthcare personnel have been themselves bearing the burden of increased pressure and stress. They’ve been facing increasingly challenging working conditions and, unsurprisingly, a labour shortage is emerging as healthcare personnel turn away from the industry. Aiming to solve the crisis, Stockholm-based startup Bemlo has just raised about €3.2 million in a Seed round. The funding The funding was backed by Y Combinator, Long Journey Ventures, Uncommon Capital, and a group of angel investors that include Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, BloomTech co-founder Austen Allred and Top executives from the Swedish digital health startup Kry. The new investment will be used to fuel further expansion of Bemlo in existing and new markets in Europe. In addition to the home market Sweden, Bemlo have established operations in Norway and the UK during this year. Bemlo: Tackling a healthcare crisis Founded in 2020, Bemlo has been part of the Silicon Valley-based startup accelerator Y Combinator. The healthtech startup offers a marketplace for short-term staffing of healthcare personnel. Bemlo connects nurses and doctors with care providers to fill temporary and longer vacancies. The startup collaborates with several care providers and staffing agencies to increase the transparency of all available short-term positions in different markets. As a result, the platform is able to support healthcare employers such as primary care clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes to secure their staffing within 24 hours instead of the current three-month lead-time. Benjamin Waye, CEO, and co-founder of Bemlo said: “By providing a marketplace for short-term positions, we can match the right healthcare professionals with available short-term positions and address the current workforce shortage in healthcare. We are very proud to bring in top investors that share our vision of improving transparency and increasing efficiency within healthcare”. It’s reported a growth of more than 20% month-on-month in the first half of 2022 – reflecting that there is clear market demand for its product. Benjamin Waye added: “Today, tens of thousands of nurses and doctors use Bemlo to search, find and compare different short-term positions in healthcare. We have been able to lower the thresholds and increase transparency within the industry, which allows for more informative decision-making”. Lee Jacobs, founder, and General Partner at Long Journey Ventures said: “I’m impressed by what the team at Bemlo have accomplished in a short period of time and look forward to following their journey to better the work lives of healthcare workers in more European markets”."
2022.8.2,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/irelands-furthr-vc-expands-its-seed-fund-to-e32-million-to-back-scaling-irish-innovators/,"Dublin-based Furthr VC, previously known as DBIC Ventures, has announced the growth of its latest fund to €32 million. The fund is investing in globally scalable software and medical device companies, aiming to put Irish-born tech on the world stage. In October 2019, Further VC launched its latest fund. The original aim was to support up to 30 globally scalable software and medical device companies with a total of €23 million. Today, the firm has announced that not only has it taken on a new name, but with 20 new investors joining the fund, it’s grown to €32 million. Previously known as DBIC Ventures, the fund was initially backed by an Enterprise Ireland investment alongside 15 tech entrepreneurs, business leaders and private investors. But, the fund has gained traction. Ireland is growing a name for itself in tech development – particularly in the software and medical device sectors, and so interest in the fund has understandably increased. The fund now has 35 private backers. Since its original launch, the fund has invested in 15 companies, including some already-rpominent companies such as IVR testing SaaS company, Klearcom, construction computer vision company, Evercam, and diabetes medical device company, Bluedrop Medical. Colm O’Sullivan, Partner, Furthr VC, said: “The growth of this fund is testament to the quality of the portfolio we are building and the companies in our pipeline, as well as our strong track record and deep network that includes many of Ireland’s leading technology entrepreneurs and business leaders. At Furthr VC, we have a founder-friendly approach, enabling us to form close partnerships with start-ups and provide them with key strategic input to help drive success, which in turn ensures that we are generating strong returns for our investors.” The additional funding will enable Furthr VC to continue to seek and close deals with Ireland’s new generation of leading early-stage Irish tech companies. It can make initial investments of up to €650K in a business and as a result of the growth, it can now invest up to a total of €3 million through subsequent follow-on investment rounds. The firm goes beyond funding, also playing a supportive role for innovators and industry disruptors. The fund is backing startups from Seed to Series A stage. Richard Watson, Managing Partner, Furthr VC, commented: “We are highly active with our current fund and have completed seven new investments to date in 2022. We are continuously on the lookout for new software and MedTech start-ups as investment opportunities for the fund. This is our fourth fund, having launched the first seed fund in Ireland in the 1990s. By working closely with investee companies, we help them to navigate the scaling journey and in doing so, create significant shareholder value. We are proud to have the backing of so many top Irish tech entrepreneurs and business leaders, as well as Enterprise Ireland.” Through its current and previous funds, Furthr VC has invested in more than 75 early-stage Irish tech companies including digital health company, SilverCloud Health; smart grid company Grid Beyond; and taxi dispatch platform, iCabbi. It’s certainly committed to the Irish startup ecosystem, and it’s interesting to see how growth will continue in current tumultuous times. Ireland is of course placed in the middle of the ongoing Brexit drama between the UK and the EU and it’s also a convenient location for US companies taking the leap to European shores."
2022.8.2,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/uk-based-foodtech-startup-clean-food-group-leaps-forward-to-launch-palm-oil-alternative/,"Foodtech startup Clean Food Group is on a mission to develop a more sustainable alternative to palm oil. The UK-based team has now ended its seed round, acquired the required intellectual property, and embarked on new partnerships to scale up the development of its pioneering product. Palm oil is a massive market. It’s hidden in the ingredients list in many (if not most) of the foods consumed on a daily basis around the world. However, palm oil is responsible for majorly devastating environmental and societal impacts. The global palm oil market is expected to reach about €65 billion by 2027, but it’s driving deforestation in some of the world’s most diverse habitats, it’s emitting millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases, and, the exploitation of workers and child labour has been a significant concern. Knowledge about the harmful impacts of palm oil production is widespread, but, alternatives have been few and far between, and so the problem has continued. Until now. Clean Food Group is developing an alternative – aiming to be part of the solution to the palm oil crisis. Clean Food Group Based in the UK, Clean Food Group (CFG) are developing a viable yeast-based alternative to palm oil. The startup reports that their lab-grown cellular-based alternative could help reduce the detrimental impact of a range of palm-based ingredients – reportedly found in 50% of all packaged products on supermarket shelves. The startup began this year by acquiring the relevant intellectual property from the University of Bath where the technology has been developed over the last eight years by Professor Chris Chuck and his team. Prior to the acquisition, in excess of €5 million had been spent developing the technology to the stage where it is ready for scale-up and commercialisation. The foodtech startup also just completed its seed round of €1.96 million – led by Agronomics – and, signed a two-year collaboration agreement with the University of Bath to scale the tech and bring the palm oil alternative to the market. Funding and Partnerships to Grow Taking on the palm oil industry is no small feat. To do it, CFG is relying on a combination of cutting-edge tech, strategic partnerships and securing impact investment. Now with the intellectual property rights to the tech from the University of Bath, the startup has initiated a two-year collaboration agreement with the university. Further, Professor Chris Chuck, the lead developer of the product, has joined the team as a technical advisor and leads a team of scientists at a dedicated Clean Food Group laboratory and Pilot Plant at the University of Bath. Chris Chuck said: “Our dependence on palm oil comes at a great environmental cost. We’ve worked over many years to create robust palm oil alternatives that give us a real chance to cut the impact of a range of products that until now have only been possible to produce with palm oil and the deforestation, pollution and emissions that come with it.” This is in addition to the funding secured from Agronomics, a leading company in the field of cellular agriculture. The company has led Clean Food Group’s financing rounds to date including their recently completed seed round. Agronomics holds a 35% interest in the company and Jim Mellon has joined the Board. Other early investors joining Agronomics include AIM listed SEED Innovations Limited, a leading global food and beverage company, as well as venture capital investors. Alex Neves, co-founder and CEO of Clean Food Group: “We are delighted to work with Professor Chris Chuck and his growing Clean Food Group team at the University of Bath to bring a commercially viable and sustainable alternative to palm oil to market. We have seen such significant demand for our seed financing round and are particularly excited to be working with Agronomics, widely recognised as a pioneer of the cellular agriculture investment community, as our cornerstone investor.” Making Impact The palm oil industry is threatening the world’s most important habitats and impacting critically endangered species like the orangutan, pygmy elephant and Sumatran rhino. This process combined with the conversion of carbon-rich peat soils is a major contributor to the climate crisis. The environmental impacts are catastrophic. And so are the societal – more and more reports are exposing worker exploitation and child labour to fuel the palm oil market. A lack of control and oversight over this spiralling sector means that the exploitation of people and environments can only be predicted to worsen. Now, Clean Food Group is further investing in the development of a large-scale pilot plant and securing regulatory approval for new products. Altogether, it brings the company one step closer to launching a palm oil alternative that is sustainable and can be mass-produced. Alex Neves added: “With this funding round now successfully completed, we are not only well capitalised to complete the next stage of our corporate development, but are also well placed to take the next step on the path to bringing our palm oil alternative, an ingredient with the potential to solve substantial environmental, food security, health and working environment challenges within the incumbent palm oil supply chain, to market.”"
2022.8.3,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/cornerstone-vc-announces-a-e23-9-million-fund-to-back-diverse-teams-in-the-uk/,"London-based Cornerstone VC has announced the first close of its fund at about €23.9 million. The fund will back entrepreneurs and innovators that are underrepresented and startups led by diverse teams. Investment and funding have a diversity problem. There’s no sugarcoating it – the reality is that diverse founders are vastly underrepresented and underfunded across Europe. According to a report by Cornerstone released in 2021, only 1% of founders that receive seed funding identify as black and only 3% of VC-funded founders identify as black. Further, of those that fo receive funding 75% of founders come from privileged or advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, and hardly any founders come from families living on welfare entitlements. This is the state of the sector – and it’s simply unacceptable. There have been efforts to address the situation, to make the VC world more diversity-friendly and to back unrepresented and undervalued founders and innovators. This is what Cornerstone VC want to contribute towards, and they’ve just closed the first round at over €23.9 million to support and grow the cause. Cornerstone VC – backing diversity Founded by Edwin Appiah, Rodney Appiah, Wilfred Fianko in the UK, Cornerstone VC began life as a black-led angel network – Cornerstone Partners. Founded in 2016, Cornerstone backed founders from the black community, such as ByRotation, Passionfruit, Hutch and MoonHub. It’ defined itself as a pioneering grassroots fund, backing founders from underrepresented founders and addressing the unequal societal dynamics at play in VC and business. Cornerstone VC’s mission is to establish a leading VC firm with a diversity-led investment strategy that unlocks outperformance and delivers returns for investors. Cornerstone VC will target management teams with inherent (such as age, gender or ethnicity) and acquired diversity (social capital) and address the equity funding gap for entrepreneurs that are too often overlooked and underestimated by the wider funding community. The fund This new fund will focus on tech-enabled companies at pre-seed and seed stage, typically investing initial cheques of between £250k and £1 million with capital reserved for follow-up funding. This fund is thinking long-term. It plans to invest in up to 40 companies with a significant proportion based outside of London. In an innovative ‘twist’ on the traditional VC model, Cornerstone’s angel network will also receive a share of the fund’s profits via carry participation. Rodney Appiah, Managing Partner at Cornerstone Partners, explained: “We are on a mission to put teams at the heart of our investment approach, believing diversity is key to driving outperformance. We are looking for businesses that are intentional about team composition, can excel in high growth environments and are truly obsessive about execution. People first, software second.” “Contrary to perceptions around a pipeline problem, we don’t see any evidence of that. We meet more than 500 diverse founder led businesses a year and our own data indicates that there is a growing pipeline of high growth, innovation led, investment opportunities led by diverse founders, particularly at pre seed and seed stage requiring further institutional investment.” Who’s investing BGF, the UK’s most active investor of growth capital and The Hg Foundation, a grant-giving charity with a mission to remove barriers to education & skills in technology, both led the first round close, as well as others including Atomico, one of Europe’s leading VC funds focusing on Series A and beyond. Other investors include Nic Humphries and several senior partners from Hg, a leading software and services investor, as well as other individual investors including former BVCA Chair Neil Macdougall, Scott Mackin, Jamie Broderick, Stefan Ericsson and Sidumiso Sibanda. Stephen Welton, Executive Chair, BGF said: “We are delighted to be backing Rodney, a BGF alumni, and the team at Cornerstone VC in the launch of its ground-breaking seed-stage tech fund, which complements BGF’s established minority investment for small and mid-sized growth businesses. BGF is actively committed to supporting a targeted range of activities where the objective is to make a real and meaningful difference to broader representation in the investment and entrepreneurial communities. We are very encouraged that the work we have done supporting female entrepreneurs has resulted in us being the most active investor in women-led scaleups in the country.” Nic Humphries, Senior Partner and Executive Chairman at Hg, added: “Hg has over 20 years’ experience in partnering with and rapidly growing innovative software businesses. This experience has demonstrated that diversity in leadership often leads to better investment and business decisions. Diversity in the technology sector continues to be a priority for us, the businesses we invest in and is also at the heart of The Hg Foundation. As such my colleagues and I are delighted to support the Cornerstone team and we look forward to working together.” The team Founder Rodney has served as a committee member for Lloyds Banking Group’s Black Business Advisory Committee, Innovate UK’s Credit Committee and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s Black Business Association. He previously chaired the CBI’s London Under 35 Committee. Edwin currently serves as an IC member of Imperial College’s Enterprise Fund and was a former International Banker at Coutts, advising more than 100 owner manager businesses across US and Europe. Wilfred currently serves as a board observer at a leading LSE Listed Private Equity firm in the UK and was formerly a senior management consultant at UBS and KPMG, specialising in financial services transformation."
2022.8.3,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/payments-for-founders-the-nontechnical-guide-for-startups-sponsored/,"The day-to-day responsibilities of a startup founder are plentiful and time-consuming. From developing a mission and vision, to recruiting a trusted team of employees and executives, to sourcing initial funding—it’s nonstop. A common misconception of those looking to start their own business is that they must have the skills and time to do it all themselves. In the case of having a world-class payments solution, founders can turn to help. Check out Stripe’s latest guide for nontechnical founders to learn how Stripe Payments can take the hard work out of implementing a payments solution, allowing entrepreneurs to spend more time doing what they do best: building a great product or service. By using Stripe, entrepreneurs don’t need any technical background to master the key elements of launching and running a successful online company. Stripe offers a full stack of financial tools, from collecting payments to onboarding sellers and service providers. Stripe’s integration is fast and low-cost, reducing the complexity and time needed to build them in-house. With Stripe handling the technicality of setting up a secure payments system, more time can be spent thinking about strategy and planning. Getting started Launching a new business isn’t easy. One of the most overlooked challenges—yet one of the most important milestones for any company’s journey—is making the first sale. Stripe has a range of payment products that are exclusively dedicated to driving a startup’s first sale. With features like no-code payment buttons that can be embedded within emails and text messages, Stripe Payments has everything an entrepreneur needs to set up for success. Making the checkout experience as simple and accessible as possible is critical. Online consumers today expect more from their checkout experience, and research shows that late-stage cart abandonment is one of the top causes of lost sales in today’s market. Stripe’s payments guide can show founders how effortless implementing a top-class payments system can be. Keeping loyalty front of mind After making the first sale and growing a foundational customer base, it’s important to ensure the user experience is as seamless as possible to improve brand perceptions and increase customer retention. With the rapid growth of ecommerce in recent years, barriers to launching a business and reaching a global audience have certainly lowered, but it’s also raised the stakes and upped the competition in the market. Maintaining growth and the ability to scale appropriately are important parts of any startup’s success story. However, there must be a separate strategy in place to retain your customers and reduce churn. For startups, losing customers as a result of unoptimised experiences for repeat purchases is a simple, yet costly mistake—one that companies really shouldn’t be making in today’s booming ecommerce marketplace. Creating a seamless payment flow is essential in solidifying those customer relationships and ultimately building customer and brand loyalty. Stripe’s subscription and invoicing product, Stripe Billing, offers key features such as a smart retry function which can help retain those vital return customers. Not only is a seamless experience essential to building brand loyalty, it also builds trust between brands and customers. Stripe Radar blocks fraudulent attacks and minimises false positives so real customer transactions can succeed.

2022.8.3,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/time-to-say-goodbye-to-cash-how-fintech-is-shaking-up-payments/,"Cash is king… or is it?  The idea of cash being the preferred payment method of consumers and merchants could be a distant memory of the past. It wasn’t until the last decade that non-cash payment methods were widely accepted across Europe, but in the finance world, things move fast. It is expected that by 2025, cashless payments adoption will reach over 80%. The pandemic and a boom in ecommerce have increased the popularity of digital payments. Europe is at the forefront of payments innovation, in large part propelled by the regulatory environment and implementation of Payments Service Directive 2 (PSD 2). PSD 2 mandated more consumer-friendly payment solutions with the introduction of Open Banking and increased security for payments. Alternative payment methods are defined as payment methods that aren’t cash or credit card payments – they are gaining popularity in Europe and internationally. You likely have noticed an alternative payment method at checkout or might be already using them. Examples of alternative payment methods are electronic wallets, buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), and crypto payments. Merchants should ensure that they support their customers’ preferred payment methods to optimise their customer’s experience and increase conversion. According to TrueLayer, two-thirds of ecommerce purchases will be made using ‘alternative’ payment methods by 2026 as credit and debit card payments are slowly falling in popularity. In 2021, credit and debit cards made up 41% of all ecommerce payments in Europe – but things are changing. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the payments industry, and the fact this has major consequences for startups, we wanted to outline a few alternative payment methods that are emerging in popularity across Europe. Given the diversity of cultures across the European region, it is also important to highlight that the adoption of different payment methods varies across different regions of the continent. Over the next few years, we should expect to see a reshuffling in the market share of alternative payment methods. Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) BNPL is a type of financing that is offered to customers at the point of sale that allows them to repay in future instalments with zero or low interest over a short time horizon. Some notable European BNPL companies are Alma (France), Klarna (across Europe), divido (across Europe), scalapay (across Europe), and Twisto (focused on central and eastern Europe). With the rise in popularity of BNPL payments, other European consumer fintechs have also launched their own BNPL payments products including Revolut, Monzo, and Curve. Lots of funding has been pumped into BNPL which has led to rapid expansion and popularity amongst both customers and merchants. In 2021, BNPL accounted for 8.1% of European e-commerce spending and nearly 2% of regional POS (point of sale) transactional value. Customers have a higher likelihood to convert when options are available – which reduces the perceived financial burden and makes the purchasing decision more straightforward. BNPL is popular among Gen Zs and Millennials who prefer to be more flexible with their finances. Retailers that offered BNPL enjoy a 50-200% increase in units per transaction. There are concerns around BNPL causing consumers to accumulate unmanageable amounts of debt. BNPL is relatively accessible to most customers through a soft credit check. However, if customers default or make late payments, they may be reported to credit reference agencies. The EU government are in discussions to increase regulatory requirements for BNPL providers to increase consumer protection. In July 2022, the EU’s Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) approved amendments that will likely require BNPL companies to increase their transparency. BNPL providers need to be careful their product isn’t contributing to harmful patterns of debt and so need to keep ethics at the forefront when desinging their solution. Electronic wallets Electronic wallets enable customers to load money into their accounts that they can use for purchases. Electronic wallets can be used offline and online. Customers load their electronic wallets through various methods including bank transfers and cash. Examples of electronic wallets are Alipay and Paypal. According to Sticpay, the dominance of e-wallets is expected to grow and they anticipate that 30% of e-commerce transactions in Europe will be facilitated through e-wallets by 2024. Paypal holds its dominance in the electronic wallets market as one of the oldest and most reputable brands in the space. In Europe, the UK leads in the usage of Paypal in Europe with Germany and France behind the UK. Crypto payments Consumers are becoming increasingly interested in crypto. In a Gemini report, 41% of respondents internationally said that they are crypto-curious with Europeans being the most curious compared to other regions. To follow where consumers are heading, B2C companies are starting to make moves into web3 including creating NFTs and accepting crypto payments although cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Various European companies have started to accept cryptocurrencies across different sectors from fashion to airlines. FARFETCH announced that they will start to accept cryptocurrencies and partnered with Lunu to facilitate crypto transactions. The full rollout of cryptocurrency acceptance follows a successful trial of cryptocurrency payments at FARFETCH Group companies’ retail stores including Browns locations in London and Off-White flagships in Paris, London, and Milan. Other companies that have also announced that they are accepting crypto payments include Gucci, Vueling, Balenciaga, Microsoft, Starbucks, AirBaltic (the first airline to accept Bitcoin in 2014), LOT Polish Airlines, and GetYourGuide. Mobile wallets Mobile wallets store customers’ payments methods and funds on their mobile devices whereby customers can make payments through their mobile wallets. Examples of mobile wallets include Alipay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. Mobile wallets can be used electronically or at point-of-sale (most notably through contactless payments). Research from Payvision shows that 3% of consumers were using Apple, Google, or Samsung Pay as their preferred payment method. Local bank transfers and direct from account payments  Bank transfers are typically facilitated on the tech that the bank builds themselves but more recently have been powered by Open Banking technology. Open Banking was rolled out in 2018 following the implementation of PSD2. Local bank transfers powered by local banks are only available for domestic customers whereas Open Banking is available in the UK and EU-wide. Examples of bank transfers solutions include:  iDEAL in the Netherlands – In the Netherlands, consumers make 60% of their online purchases with iDEAL. Przewlewy24 in Poland Giropay and Sofort in Germany Swish in Sweden  For merchants, bank transfers charge lower fees than payments made through credit cards and funds settle faster. Another benefit for merchants is that customers cannot make chargebacks on bank transfers; typically chargebacks can lead to significant losses for merchants due to customers attempting to commit fraud. So, what does this all mean for European startups? The future of payments, and the constantly evolving way consumers purchase, are important for any startup. Founders and businesses need to keep connected with their customers to ensure they are offering the most preferred way to pay – and implement it effectively. Doing so can enhance customer loyalty, boost revenue, and reflect that the company is continually investing in future-proof solutions."
2022.8.3,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/london-based-ben-picks-up-e15-6-million-for-its-platform-making-workplace-benefits-work-for-everyone-everywhere/,"With its global platform that is empowering better employee benefits, London-based startup Ben, has secured €15.6 million in fresh capital. Ben is on a mission to make workplace benefits work for everyone, everywhere and is now embarking on exciting growth plans. The global shift in approaches to working is affecting lives and businesses in an immense way. Advances in tech, coupled with new attitudes to work (and not to forget, the global pandemic that accelerated these changes), have meant that working expectations have shifted entirely. The majority of workers now work in a hybrid or remote format, and, expect more flexibility and more benefits from their employers. Workplace benefits now need to provide much more than simply bog-standard insurance and retirement plans. The employee wellbeing market, for example, is now worth over €55 billion. New products are frequently coming to market to suit every lifestyle, from earned wage access to mental health, fertility, parenthood support, and new insurance products. However, the benefits ecosystem is fragmented and undigitized. The growing spectrum of possibilities for employee benefits is still young, and it’s a space in need of some formation. Employee benefit engagement sits at less than 20%, with companies wasting billions of dollars on unused, one-size fits all benefits that don’t necessarily cater for the diverse and global workforce. Ben, founded in 2019 by Sebastian Fallert (CEO) and David Duckworth (COO) is offering a global platform for employee benefits and it’s just secured a fresh capital investment. “This is the first time in history that four generations coexist in the workforce at the same time. Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z participate in a complex global economy, and their benefit requirements vary and fluctuate,” said Ben CEO and Co-Founder Sebastian Fallert. “Companies, many of whom are spending around 33% of payroll on benefits, are reassessing their traditional benefits packages to fit more culturally and ethnically diverse teams distributed around the world.” The Funding The Series A funding was led by Atomico and brings the startup’s total funding to around €20.6 million. Investment also came from Cherry Ventures, DN Capital and Seedcamp, as well as HR and FinTech founders such as Phil Chambers and Neil Ryland (Peakon CEO and CRO), Ross Seychell (Personio CPO) and Job van der Voort (Remote). As part of the investment, Atomico Partner Sasha Vidiborskiy will join Ben’s board. Ben will use the funding to accelerate the development of its SaaS and payments technology and expand its global employer customer base. Additionally, Ben will be investing in building its team to help achieve the goal of becoming the technology infrastructure for all global benefits – connecting employers, employees, brokers, and benefits providers. Employee benefits for everyone, everywhere On the back of over 10x year-on-year growth, Ben is revolutionising the workplace benefits experience for all players in the ecosystem. The open platform allows employees to choose from a wide array of options and find what suits them – removing the challenging HR task of sourcing and managing a package relevant for an entire workforce or spending money on benefits that are stored in spreadsheets and never used. It means benefits are more personal, and employees feel more engaged in the process. They get an active role to play in their benefits – it only seems logical. By using Ben, employers empower workers to make smart use of benefit budgets and enable vital flexibility as needs and desires naturally shift in line with evolving lifestyles. The per-employee Ben Mastercard and flexible allowance function take personalisation one step further, as companies can set budgets and spending rules to put decision-making in the hands of the employee to choose what suits them best. Aside from enhancing employee engagement, Ben’s tech cuts out admin for HR managers integrating accounting, HR, and Payroll systems to streamline all onboarding, enrollment, management and offboarding processes. It also has data sharing capabilities which can be used by brokers and supplies to adapt benefit offers to better suit the reality of the modern workforce. With a rapidly growing customer base, the benefits of Ben are already felt by many of the world’s fastest-growing global companies. Ben is working with 150+ companies globally, from mid-sized, fully distributed companies to large enterprises. Prominent names include Zalando, Deliveroo, Funding Circle, Pleo, BitPanda and Remote."

2022.8.4,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/healthtech-startup-cera-care-secures-over-e310-million-to-empower-better-at-home-care/,"One of Europe’s leading providers of digital-first home healthcare, Cera Care has secured over €310 million. Operating in the UK and Germany, the startup is freeing up hospital beds and empoering elderly and vulnerable patients to access better and more affordable care from the comfort of their own homes. While the healthcare sector across Europe finds itself under unprecedented strain, new and innovative solutions need to be found to ensure that people are still accessing the care they need. Aiming to do just that, whilst freeing up space in hospitals, making the life of healthcare staff a little easier, and providing patients with quality care, Cera Care has secured a mega funding injection of over €310 million. The Funding The equity and debt investment place Cera as the top player in Europe’s digital-first home healthcare market. More broadly, Cera is also one of the fastest-growing companies on the continent. The funding round was led by Cera’s existing investor Kairos HQ, alongside the Vanderbilt University Endowment, Evolve Healthcare Partners alongside Schroders Capital, Jane Street Capital, Yabeo Capital, Squarepoint Capital, Guinness Asset Management, Oltre Impact, 8090 Partners, technology investor Robin Klein and several other international institutional investors. Goldman Sachs International and JPMorgan Securities PLC acted as Placement Agents to Cera for the equity portion of the raise. Dr Ben Maruthappu MBE, CEO and Co-founder of Cera, commented: “Since Cera’s launch in November 2016 the company has scaled at an unprecedented rate for the sector, benefiting countless lives, and proving the need for technology-powered improvement in healthcare. Receiving such significant financial backing during this period of global economic volatility, is testament to the strength of Cera’s business model, our innovation, and our commitment to revolutionising healthcare. We’re now in pole position to be able to use our unique technology to expand what we do for patients across the world who are in need of care, while relieving pressures on public services.” Pioneering better at-home care Launched in 2016 by Dr Ben Maruthappu MBE, Cera is a digital-first home healthcare company delivering care, nursing, telehealth and repeat prescriptions. The mission is to empower patients to live longer, better lives in the comfort of their own homes, saving the need to go to the hospital. The healthtech company operates in the UK and Germany, giving at-home care that is more affordable than a patient receiving care in a hospital, due to its technology-powered model. Cera’s Carers and Nurses collect patient symptoms and health data during at-home appointments, which its artificial intelligence algorithms use to predict deterioration in conditions before they occur, triggering earlier health interventions to prevent people from becoming unwell. It’s reported that the tech has reduced hospitalisation rates by an unprecedented 52%, predicted up to 80% of hospitalisations seven days in advance, reduced patient falls by ~17%, urinary problems by ~47%, infections by ~15% and also helped to improve medication and prescription compliance in older patients by 35%. These are stats which certainly catch attention. Europe’s healthcare systems are under immense pressure at the moment, with labour shortages and government funding cuts leaving crises occurring across the continent. For example, the NHS is currently reporting waiting lists at a record high of 6.6 million. Looking worldwide, society is still adapting to living with COVID-19, exacerbating the need for quality, tech-powered care to be provided in the home. The impact on patients can not be understated either. Having access to quality healthcare is a fundamental human right, and currently too many are suffering because of ineffective health systems and poor government decisions. Christine Wand from Suffolk, being cared for by Cera, commented: “Cera has completely changed my life. Managing my health problems has been really difficult, but now that I have a Cera carer and their app, their technology has helped me to really stay on top of my health and wellbeing and it has dramatically improved my outlook on life. My carer is more like a friend – she is so reliable, so friendly and she truly understands me and my needs. My carer also organises my medication which has taken a huge burden off both my shoulders and my families’, and they are able to arrange for me to see a nurse at the click of a button whenever I need to. I truly don’t know what I would do without Cera’s help.” Cera’s digital-first home healthcare frees up much-needed hospital beds by supporting the NHS to discharge healthy patients sooner and enabling them to live independently in their own homes for longer. Tim Creed, Head of Private Equity Investments of Schroders Capital, said: “Ageing populations, post-pandemic recovery and major staff shortages have created a series of issues facing healthcare providers and governments. Cera’s proposition is proven to deliver results to face down these challenges. Cera’s digital-first home healthcare is a unique offering that we believe must be rolled out far and wide to provide a tangible solution to hospital waiting times, building a bigger carer workforce and to help our elderly communities to receive quality, genuine care. We’re proud to be a partner of Cera, and to play a part in supporting their mission to empower people to live longer, better lives in their own homes through technology.” The company has scaled rapidly thanks to its combination of proprietary tech and compassionate carers. It has reported 100-fold growth in under three years with now hundreds of millions in annual revenues and currently servicing 15,000 patients per day – the bed capacity equivalent to more than 40 NHS hospitals. Cera’s technology is also used by over 2,000 care businesses that collectively deliver over 1 million at-home appointments per week. Moving forward with its tech that is making tangible defences to lives in UK and Germany, Cera wants to expand. The new capital will be used to enhance investment n nursing, telehealth and prescription delivery services, both in the UK and internationally, to provide multiple healthcare services per household. Doing so will reduce hospital waiting times, keep elderly patients out of the hospital, and relieve pressure on national health services. Sir David Behan CBE, Chair of Cera’s Advisory Board and former CEO of the Care Quality Commission, added: “Governments around the world have been searching for solutions to the ongoing challenges in healthcare. Cera’s blend of cutting-edge technology and truly compassionate carers represents the future for health and social care, in the UK and beyond. Cera has already transformed the lives of tens of thousands of people, helped the UK Government to employ carers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and created and implemented technology that gives carers, those they care for and their families peace of mind, while also giving them the freedom to live their lives in the comfort of their own homes. Cera’s Next Chapter will take that further to more people who require care, more countries and with more technology innovations.”"
2022.8.4,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/the-rise-of-govtech-why-startups-should-work-with-governments-sponsored/,"There’s another market that B2B startups with innovative digital solutions can target – the public sector. While working with the government might not be the obvious choice for startups, it’s a unique opportunity. Now, there are various GovTech initiatives creating new opportunities for tech creators to collaborate with local and global public sector institutions. It’s an exciting development for both innovators and governments, as well as wider society. So, why should startups work with the public sector? Collaboration between governments and startups can bring about plenty of exciting and meaningful outcomes. Here we outline three reasons why entrepreneurs should consider the public sector as their next target. Global market size The global market of digital tech solutions for governments – GovTech – is currently estimated to be around €441 billion! In Europe alone, the GovTech market is sitting at around €166 billion, and it’s estimated to grow trifold in the next 3 years – opening even bigger expansion prospects to digital creators. This is a market with a potential that’s not to be underestimated. Tapping into this sphere and making a success of it brings an exciting future to any startup with ambitious plans. Further, there are no special prerequisites for an IT company to become competitive in the global GovTech market. Multiple countries face very similar challenges and are looking for the same solutions that could solve them. Therefore, locally created GovTech solutions might become very sought-after export items, especially if they are already tested locally and brought impressive results. For example, a Lithuanian mobility-as-a-service startup is successfully allowing people to plan their public transport trips not only locally in Lithuania, but also worldwide, reaching cities such as Riga, Berlin, Zurich, Jakarta, Bogota, Rio de Janeiro, and beyond. Local governments are prepared to spend Global expansion is usually the biggest motivation for most companies, but this begins with setting up a strong foundation. The growing need for digitalization in the public sector and with governments locally allows startups to successfully take the first steps in their country. Creating pilot solutions for local markets, successfully selling them, and getting feedback from public sector clients can help ambitious startups to perfect their solutions and prepare them for global clients and markets. Countries already spend billions of euros on public procurement, and the procurement part of the software and IT services is growing every year. In the near future, the need for digitalization will only grow, so businesses have a great opportunity to secure a new client with deep pockets for life – the public sector. Reliable clients For startups that are only starting or are focused on scaling their business, public sector organisations can become reliable long-term clients – there is no unexpected risk that the client might go bankrupt! Therefore, new and fast-growing companies are safe from the losses that might be fatal in the first years of business. In addition, startups working with public sector clients, who are providing the service to wider society, can meaningfully contribute to smoother processes and technologies that make everyday life easier for the citizens. How to get started? Govtech solutions are getting increasingly more attention. To facilitate enhanced collaboration between public and private sectors, many countries establish GovTech initiatives that are willing to help companies to meet their potential public sector clients. Arune Matelyte, the Manager of GovTech Lab Lithuania said: “the public sector is as motivated as ever to explore the use of digital technologies and make its processes more effective. The society has already noticed great improvements in many digital services, such as tax declaration in Lithuania. Our goal is to understand the problems that the public sector faces and ensure that the startups and innovative companies could successfully apply their solutions to solve them. There is no better time to start working with the public sector than now.” To learn more about GovTech Lab Lithuania and how the country is steadily becoming one of the GovTech leaders in Europe and the whole globe, subscribe to the GovTech Lab Lithuania newsletter.

2022.8.4,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/berlin-based-cnc24-lands-e8-25-million-for-its-digital-b2b-procurement-platform/,"CNC24, a startup on a mission to digitize precision parts procurement has just secured €8.25 million. The Berlin-based startup is now ramping up its expansion across Europe and expanding its global supplier network. The market for industrial and machine components hasn’t really changed in recent years. Whilst other sectors have jumped on the digital bandwagon, procurement processes in this space have remained complex and hard to navigate. As we live in increasingly turbulent times economically, with growing pressures on supply chains, industry innovation in procurement is needed now more than ever before. This is what CNC24 is aiming to do. Founded in 2019 by the former wefox CMO Willi Ruopp and industry expert Marlon Gerat, CNC24 has developed an AI-driven B2B2 marketplace platform. Willi Ruopp, CEO and Co-Founder of CNC24 explained: “We are on the road to become the undisputed No. 1 for precision parts in Europe. We founded CNC24 with the goal to revolutionize the component sourcing process with a hybrid approach that combines smart AI-driven automation with personalized expert consulting. We are very excited to have well-known investors on our side to support our integrative platform approach and conquer the €50+ billion market for components.” The Funding The Berlin-based team has just closed its Series A funding with €8.25 million in the bag. Future Industry Ventures led the funding round alongside coparion, EquityPitcher Ventures and existing investor, Seedcamp. Stefano Gurciullo, Partner at Future Industry Ventures, said: “In increasingly volatile markets struck by supply chain risks, CNC24 addresses a major thorn in the side of the manufacturing industry. Sourcing industrial components from the right partner, at the right price and quality is both costly and time intensive, especially for SMEs and deep tech ventures. We are impressed by CNC24’s strategy of mixing a platform approach with top grade quality assurance, ultimately saving truly substantial resources to their customers. We are deeply convinced by the team’s vision and cannot wait to expand this new standard in sourcing and procurement together. The startup is also supported by experienced business angels such as the wefox Co-Founders Dario Fazlic and Fabian Wesemann. Digitizing Procurement With its innovative platform solution, the technology company creates a transparent process for the procurement of manufacturing parts and digitizes the value chain up to a fully automated procurement process. The company leverages a global network of suppliers and so is able to guarantee free capacities, high material availability and on-time delivery of components at all times. For quality control, all parts undergo an additional testing process in the in-house measuring centre before they are delivered. CNC24 is tapping into a massive market, able to serve all industrial sectors from special machinery and plant engineering to IoT and medical, testing and measurement technology. Already, the platform has customers such as SIEMENS, DIEHL Group, Qualcomm, KRONES AG, Carl Zeiss, Vishay, BASF, CERN, FANUC and Syntegon are trusting CNC24 as a sourcing partner for precision components. In total, CNC24 has already generated an offer volume of over 500 million euros after just three years. The data-driven approach enables a smooth matching process between the parts and the machine tools of over 500 manufacturing partners around the world. CNC24 relies on market-driven pricing, in which the connected manufacturers calculate their offer prices independently and available production capacities can be accessed in real-time. Marlon Gerat added: “With our unique hybrid approach, we give our customers exactly what they need and create a lasting customer relationship. While the procurement process is already completely automated, our expert team of engineers and machinists are available to advise our customers. In addition, we can guarantee a high-quality standard not only because of our carefully selected partners but our in-house Quality-Assurance-As-A-Service center in Berlin.” The company’s goal is to create an ecosystem for a transparent and simple procurement process for customers and suppliers. This new funding will be used to further develop the product, ramp up sales organization and recruit new employees. This is in addition to expanding into new markets. Stefan Martinez, Investment Manager at coparion, commented: “CNC24 has convinced us from the very beginning with its profound understanding of the market and customer needs. The strong focus on high-quality and intensive customer support in the right place clearly sets CNC24 apart from the competition. This can also be seen in the great customer feedback and strong sales growth. The team around Marlon and Willi complement each other’s strengths perfectly and, in addition to deep industry expertise, have demonstrated the drive needed to build something huge. We look forward to supporting CNC24 in this funding round and over the years to come.”"

Based in Finland, Kide is aiming to encourage new ways of learning and has been awarded the Education Finland Award for its fresh approach to education. The world of education is no longer dictated by stuffy classrooms, dusty textbooks and strict lesson plans – at least, it doesn’t need to be. Edtech is a growing sector, building on research into best learning practices and using cutting-edge tech to provide fresh takes on education that are more beneficial to learners mental wellbeing, curiosity and long-term skills acquisition. Aiming to encourage learning that is based on a child’s curiosity and sense of wonder, Kide wants to motivate children to learn how the world around them works, whilst also making life a little easier for overburdened teachers. The startup has just scored €1 million and picked up the First Education Finland Award as the best learning solution for international markets. The Funding The capital boost was led by Sparkmind Fund, in syndication with Tesi (Finnish Industry Investment Ltd) and also included an R&D loan from Business Finland. This significant investment will take the company’s total seed funding to €3.2 million since launching in December 2017. Kide: A child-centric education model Developed by three female founders – Jenni Vartiainen, Sari Hurme-Mehtälä and Aino Kuronen – after years of intensive research, Kide is on a mission to get children excited about how the world around them works. At the same time, the platform aims to ease a busy teacher’s life with ready-made lesson plans based upon a child’s sense of wonder. Jenni Vartiainen explained: “Our research and feedback from customers shows that a child’s imagination can help learning in more areas than just science – there’s really compelling evidence that shows hands-on learning through stories and play is effective in all areas: we’ve seen it help develop skills in math, language, social emotional learning and social studies. It’s incredible, really.” Kide has already transformed the way over a million children, parents and teachers learn together through stories and play. And they don’t want to stop anytime soon. With this new funding, the edtech team will develop even more holistic activities to suit all different learning areas. Kide has also secured a partnership with DreamWorks’ Gabby’s Dollhouse. A wide range of lesson plans and activities have been created; to be used in tandem with the hit Netflix show. These are available now on Kide’s teacher platform. The new investment will also focus on accelerating Kide’s growth in the US – enabling Kide to pursue new US partnerships and explore key international homeschooling markets. In addition, a senior UX designer and Head of Product will be hired who will develop the current product into a more streamlined, yet enhanced user experience. Kide has also picked up plenty of attention in its home market of Finland, winning the First Education Finland Award this summer. Consideration for the award was given to the impact, innovativeness and scalability of the solution; the pedagogical quality and background of the solution, as well as the technical quality, accessibility and support a company provides. The jury also paid attention to the business model and its ethical sustainability. The jury commented: “Kide Science is an inspiring solution that sparks the desire to learn and experiment. It provides insights and a joy of learning and appeals to a wide audience. The jury sees the solution’s massive potential to be an impressive, significant, and even world-changing solution.”"

These are workers who take care of our homes and offices, yet, the daily routine of these teams has yet to be optimised operationally. Teams have noted how communication channels are overburdened, schedules are misaligned, and data is lost and improperly stored – to mention a few commonly-heard issues. Teams, basically, aren’t running smoothly and it means employer-employee relations are strained, deadlines are missed and budgets are impacted. This is what Wowflow aims to change. The startup has developed a work management and collaboration software specifically for these teams and has now picked up additional investment.

It’s backed by prominent investors like Stefan Polletin (former Co-Founder of Casavi), Proptech Fund High Rise Ventures from Germany, Early-stage Fund Lemonade Stand from Estonia, Peter Steinberger (former Founder of PSPDFKit, Founders of Europe), and Rolf Adam (Senior Vice President of Hitachi Solutions Europe). This new funding comes off the back of a €300k raise last year. Wowflow – Redefining how facility management teams work Founded in 2018 by Drazen Ivanis (CEO), Wowflow is on a mission to supercharge teams, optimising workflows and enhancing collaboration through a digital tool. Drazen himself worked as a facility manager in Vienna before founding the startup, his own frustrations giving him the push to launch a product that would change how things work for the better. He explained: “I felt how complicated and thankless building maintenance is. You are constantly under the water with so many small things you need to keep track of. You have no idea whether workers or service providers do what they promised. And everyone keeps asking: why can’t you make it cheaper?” Unlike other solutions on the market, Wowflow has a key focus on the user experience to ensure any field worker can easily adapt the tool without any training. Additionally, Wowflow allows managers to coordinate the work both between employees and external contractors flexibly. That enables facility managers to delegate more work and service providers to win more customers. The young startup now has over 40 customers across 5 countries, proving particularly popular in the cleaning sector. As noted by Stefan Polletin, former CEO of Attensam Sbg/Ooe: “Cleaning of the buildings is much more demanding these days. Customers expect better service with faster reaction times and a lower budget. Good employees are in short supply, especially during the COVID outbreaks. It is only a question of time when a solution that streamlines operation and brings transparency via work tracking and reporting will be an absolute necessity for facility management companies.” According to Wowflow internal estimations, there are at least 600 thousand companies in Europe and US that are involved in building maintenance. These are mostly the regional companies with 10-250 employees that historically were either too small or not ready for software solutions that mostly catered to big enterprises – there’s clearly plenty of market potential for the team to tap into. The fresh funds will be invested in market expansion, cementing Wowflow’s position as a leading work management & collaboration software for facility management teams in the DACH region. The focus is also on further improvements to the user experience for field workers, seamless multi-company collaboration, and integrations with existing Computer-Aided Facility Management and ERP software market leaders."
2022.8.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/berlins-liveeo-lands-e19-million-to-fuel-its-mission-to-bring-space-data-insights-to-industry/,"Spacetech startup LiveEO has just secured €19 million – one of the largest investments in Earth Observation that we’ve seen in Europe. The Berlin-based startup now plans to accelerate its global market expansion. Armed with the mission to improve life on earth by harnessing the power of space data, LiveEO has just secured a €19 million capital boost to rocket-launch its plans. Founded in 2018, the core product is an infrastructure monitoring suite powered by satellite imagery. Using AI to analyse Earth Observation data, the product is able to give operators of railways, power lines and pipelines (i.e Industry 4.0 players) actionable information on the risk posed by vegetation, ground deformations, or third parties. The software enables customers to optimise the maintenance programmes of core infrastructure assets, making them increasingly resilient to climate change. In turn, this reduces travel disruptions, power outages and supply chain delays There’s been a new space race picking up pace in recent years, with increasing interest in how space can help preserve and enhance life on earth. Satellite imagery, space tech and earth observation data are now increasingly being seen as significant approaches to making our global society healthier – economically, environmentally and socially. Daniel Seidel, co-founder and co-CEO of LiveEO, explained: “We are kicking off the third big wave of commercialisation of the space industry. After huge investments in rockets and satellites in the past years, it is time for companies like us to develop highly automated applications which translate data from hundreds of Earth Observation satellites into real value for end-users.” Since its €5.5 million Series A round in 2021, the Berlin-headquartered startup has doubled its headcount, tripled its revenue, signed new customers across five continents, and strengthened its market-leading position in infrastructure monitoring. In the past four years since its inception, LiveEO’s products have empowered its clients to streamline their maintenance operations, making them safer and more efficient, and saving thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions in the process. The €19 million funding round was led by MMC Ventures and includes €17M of venture capital, as well as further funds from the European Commission and Investitionsbank Berlin. All existing shareholders continue to back the company and have participated in the round, including Dieter von Holtzbrinck Ventures (DvH Ventures), Helen Ventures, Matterwave, and motu ventures. Segenia Capital and Hannover Digital Investments (HDInv) have joined the round as new investors alongside MMC. LiveEO is certainly emerging as an exciting player in the European space tech market, and these new funds will help fuel its global ambitions. The startup already has an international team across Berlin, New York and Latvia and will now use this funding for even more global market expansion. Andrei Dvornic, Principal at MMC Ventures, said: “We are excited to lead this round for LiveEO and it reflects MMC’s continued focus on emerging datasets and companies that develop AI analytics to power core business decisions. LiveEO offers a critical tool that paves the way for sustainable industry automation, and we wholeheartedly support the company’s vision of leveraging satellite technologies, big data, and the latest developments in artificial intelligence to help companies adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.” The investment will also be used to enhance the infrastructure monitoring products, support product development and go-to-market for the insurance sector, where LiveEO can contribute to better-informed decision-making. Sven Przywarra, co-founder and co-CEO of LiveEO, added: “It is exciting to see that our vision, as well as our execution so far, has attracted interest and investment from both top-tier venture capital firms as well as the public sector. We want to bring insights derived from space imagery to every global value chain, and continue to focus on human-centred applications. This financing round brings us a significant step closer to that goal.” Ulrich Wallin, HDInv managing director and former CEO of Hannover Re, commented: “LiveEO’s technology offers companies and institutions an efficient and smart way to monitor fixed assets. This enables potential damaging events to be detected and prevented at an early stage.”"

2022.8.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/nordic-born-summa-equity-is-taking-impact-investments-to-north-america/,"One of Europe’s most prominent impact funds, Summa Equity, is expanding across the Atlantic, opening a new office in Palo Alto this summer. This will be the Nordic firm’s first office outside of Europe and comes off the back of the unveiling of its €2.35 billion impact fund. Since 2016, Summa has been investing in companies that are solving global challenges and creating positive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes for society. Born in Stockholm and with a strong presence in Oslo, the firm opened a Munich office earlier this year and now is heading to the Golden State. Summa partners Tommi Unkuri, Gustavo Salem and Nick Roelofs will lead U.S. operations, and they will be joined by a number of Summa staff, including investment director Anna Ryrberg. Summa’s purpose has always been to co-create win-win for investors, portfolio companies, and society through aligning its vision and outcomes to the Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring a net-positive impact against ESG challenges, and the potential for long-term, sustainable outperformance. In January this year, Summa announced the closing of its third fund – a €2.35 billion impact fund, which is to be invested in companies which solve the biggest challenges the world is facing. Summa invests in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and the new fund has invested in, among others, Norway-based Tibber, a smart energy company that is active in several European markets. Europe has been paving the way in driving impact through innovation, and Summa has been a critical part of it – having made 23 investments that advance the UN SDGs to date. The expansion to the US is a reflection of its global vision for impact, but it’ll be interesting to see what this means for its European base and its plans for European startups going forward. Commenting, Summa founder and managing partner Reynir Indahl, said: “Summa has never been bound to its Nordic roots in the companies we work with. Our strategy is non-geographical, non-sector, and non-asset class specific. Opening a West Coast office is an extension of this approach: we are not just looking at American companies, but looking to attract and work with some of the world’s leading minds on how we can transform the world. Today’s interventions are the innovations of the past – Summa invests in global transformation.” With the move, Summa also announces that they will be prioritizing companies in healthcare, as exponential technological advancements and innovations are rapidly expanding what is possible. In turn, this is creating fundamentally new avenues for impacting health and improving patient outcomes. Summa will be investing in assets that develop innovative and transformative solutions that make healthcare more predictive, preventive, personalized, and participative. Summa partner and U.S. lead Tommi Unkuri added: “The Summa approach is very unique. In leading the Changing Demographics theme at Summa, we are seeking transformative companies that will deliver positive outcomes for communities across the globe and enable people to prosper. Such businesses typically deliver sustainable growth and achieve continued long-term success, whilst creating value for the wider public.”"
2022.8.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/milan-based-deliveristo-bags-e7-million-for-its-innovative-foodtech-marketplace/,"Foodtech startup Deliveristo has secured a fresh slice of funding, taking home €7 million of new investment. The Italian company is targeting the HOspitality, REtail and CAtering (Ho.Re.Ca) space and quickly leading establishing itself as a market leader. Foodtech is becoming one of the more active areas of investment across Europe at the moment. It’s an area full of different innovations and space to grow – from developing food alternatives to food delivery options. Then there’s the different customer base – businesses can choose to go down the B2C route or B2B. We’ve seen significant investments recently in the B2C delivery market, but what about the B2B2 sector? Specifically, for the Ho.Re.Ca space? The supply chain for HOspitality, REtail and CAtering (Ho.Re.Ca) has been steadily undergoing a process of digitisation, but investment has been slower here than in the corresponding B2C area. It’s a market with big potential and now, Milan-based Deliveristo is taking it on – and they’ve just bagged up €7 million to do it. Ivan Aimo, CEO & Co-Founder of Deliveristo, said: “As we continue our journey, we realize how much this sector still needs digitization and innovation. The goal of this round is to offer more and better services to suppliers and restaurateurs, to validate the model in other countries and to prepare the company for a significant round of expansion, on which we will start working right away.” Deliveristo: B2B foodtech marketplace Launched in 2019 by Ivan Aimo, Luca Calia and Gabriele Angeleri, Deliversityo is a foodtech marketplace connecting restaurant owners and suppliers. The Milan-based startup is on a mission to innovate and digitize the Ho.Re.Ca. supply chain. The Ho.Re.Ca. food spending represents about 30% of the total market, exceeding an estimated value of €24 billion in Italy and €155 billion in Europe in 2019. Through Deliveristo’s platform and app, chefs and restaurateurs have access to a constantly growing catalogue of food and beverage products, which today counts over 60.000 quality items from over 350 Italian suppliers. Operators can access the catalogue, which also includes artisanal and local products, quickly and easily, select what they want and receive the products directly to their restaurant or bar. At the same time, suppliers, which include both producers and distributors, can increase visibility and turnover by selling products to over 1.300 subscribers to the platform, including chefs, restaurants, shops and the new “delivery only” businesses like dark, ghost or cloud kitchens. Alessandro Pontari, Investment Director of Vertis commented: “While the B2C food delivery market is in a consolidation phase, the B2B segment represents a huge opportunity in Europe and around the world. There is not a market leader yet and the supply chain is still managed in a traditional manor, relying on text messages and calls to the suppliers. Deliveristo has a unique positioning in the process of innovation and digitization of the Ho.Re.Ca. operators, which in Italy spends more than €24 billion every year to purchase food & beverage products. Being a “pure software marketplace”, Deliveristo has a lean cost structure and scalable business model. Its experienced team has proven its execution capacity and has achieved excellent results. Deliveristo has also a positive impact in terms of sustainability, bringing reduction of food waste, greater transparency in the supply chain and lower CO2 emissions related to transport”.” To date, Deliveristo’s customer base is primarily located in the cities of Milan, Turin, Rome, Bologna and Florence, while the supplier base is located throughout Italy – it’s growing fast and picking up investor attention. The Funding This €7 million investment round was led by Vertis, Italian venture capital and private equity firm, through “Vertis Venture 5 Scaleup” fund. Other investors of the round are United Ventures SGR, through “United Ventures II” fund, which led Deliveristo’s €4,5 million Series A round in December 2020, Azimut Libera Impresa SGR, through “Azimut Digitech Fund” fund, Italian Angels for Growth (IAG), Gellify Digital Investments, Doorway and other business angels. Ivan Aimo: “We are pleased to welcome Vertis SGR, Azimut Digitech Fund and other new investors, as well as grateful to United Ventures and previous investors for continuing to support the platform we are building.” The funding will be used to consolidate Deliveristo’s position within the Italian market before expanding across Europe. It will also support the launch of new services for customers and suppliers, from data-driven marketing to payments services. Sara Lovato, Investment Manager of United Ventures, added: “We are thrilled to continue to support Deliveristo, after leading the previous series A round. The team has demonstrated its value and capability and the business model has proven to be resilient and very scalable in the B2B food delivery market, with great potential but still not fully digitalized. The excellent results achieved confirmed our expectations and we are confident in the company’s growth path.”"
2022.8.5,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/a-new-generation-of-tech-innovators-interview-with-sami-osman/,"A new generation of founders, innovators and entrepreneurs are rapidly making their presence known across Europe. Running a business is no longer an old man’s sport and startups led by millennials and Gen Z are fueling a new era of tech development and innovation. We put a spotlight on young founders recently, identifying some founders that are already staking the startup scene by storm. One of those entrepreneurs was Sami Osman, the co-founder and CEO of Quartr. Since then, Quartr actually picked up an extra €2.5 million, taking its Seed round to a total of €7 million – in just two years of existence. Based in Stockholm, Quartr is a startup bridging the gap between companies and stakeholders. In true GenZ style, Sami met his co-founders on Twitter’s financial community #FinTwit and so, the startup launched before the team had even met in person. Quartr is used by both investors and companies to achieve more insights and information, helping make investment decisions that are more informed and inherently better for the long run. It has reached over 300k downloads in 160+ countries in its first year. We talked to Sami to learn more about his experience launching a startup as a young founder, and what he is planning for the future. Tell us about your experience launching a startup. I started Quartr because of the inaccessibility of the information I needed to make day-to-day investment decisions as a retail trader. When the idea came to mind, I reached out to the brightest people I had been in contact with on financial Twitter, or ‘FinTwit’ as it’s often known. Since we were still strangers interacting with finance pseudonyms, we set up a Zoom call to discuss how we’d move forward, and from then we became Quartr’s co-founders. After that, and long after starting the company, it took over 9 months for all of us to meet in real life. The founding team is now family to me. I love them all. How did you go about getting funding? Any challenges you faced along the way? Most of our investors start off as users of our app, which is a great position to be in. Having a relatively straightforward value proposition helps as our initial meetings are more about the product roadmap and our vision rather than explaining what we’re doing. Investors buy into our vision as they themselves are experiencing the problems the app is solving, which is a fortunate place to start. For us, investor meetings are valuable moments to collect genuine feedback on our product and other friction points that we can work to solve. The finance world has a certain reputation – how would you describe it from your point of view? Is it still an ‘old boy’s club’? From what I’m seeing, the reputation of the finance world is changing. The old-fashioned culture of ties and shiny shoes sitting on all the power has started to be replaced by casual t-shirt-wearing guys and girls in Silicon Valley. Technology did initiate this shift, but increased access and financial awareness on social media has definitely also had a role to play.  Of course, if you walk through a financial district in any country, there will still be the old guard wearing stereotypical finance clothing, however I’ve recently noticed this uptight environment loosening up a bit. As a start-up with mostly Gen Z employees, we’re trying to stay casual. We even have a no-tie-wearing rule at the office. It’s important for people to feel comfortable at work. As a young founder – do you think you approach business operations and management differently? What are your key priorities for the business? I am sure that my generation has a completely different mentality compared to previous groups. First and foremost, we were born into the digital era. Attention spans may have reduced, but we’re more aware of ongoing happenings and trends, and therefore companies with younger founders tend to be a bit more mission-driven. In terms of how to run a business, our entire adult lives have been shaped by monetary easing and falling interest rates, and this affects how our generation approaches business.  We are products of our environment and nowadays it’s easy to always favour growth and owning users’ time. I’m sure what era you’re born into directly affects how you do business. There will always be people that take advantage of this, but increased investment has also given more entrepreneurs the opportunity to realise their mission. For us, as for everyone else, it’s all about execution and operational excellence. The one that solves the most obvious problems wins in the end. What’s next in your plans? With so much money circulating in financial markets, it’s amazing how far left behind most common tools are in terms of User Interface and User Experience. We’ve built a simple and elegant app, and now we’re adding to our core to truly become the new home of company communications. My goal is for every interested investor to enter our platform and say “wow”. Meanwhile, companies are right now onboarding our B2B platform, which allows their Investor Relations departments to leave a lot of time-consuming and manual work behind. This is a platform I’m especially proud of, and our team is working with Investor Relations heads to solve even more friction points for IR teams. Any advice for young wannabe founders out there? If you feel that you are solving a problem for yourself and others, don’t listen to those who tell you it’s not possible to build something bigger out of it, or that another company is already solving it. If a company had solved this issue, then why does that problem still appear in your everyday life? This is especially true in the digital world, where if you solve a problem you can both find your audience quickly and then scale fast if there is a need in the market.  In order to scale quickly, be prepared to let go of the control. As a founder, it’s easy to want to be everywhere and have your hands in everything that is happening in your company. That’s not possible for two reasons: 1) you have only 24 hours each day 2) you won’t be good at everything. Find someone whose judgement you trust, and let go of some control. Be there to support and guide your vision, and make sure the company is developing according to the bigger picture.  In the early stages, it’s pivotal to always be ready to fundraise. People are prepared to be generous and helpful, and even if they can’t set you up with investment themselves, they might well be able to connect you with someone relevant that you can learn from or that can help your company grow in another way."
2022.8.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/stockholm-based-online-pharmacy-apotekamo-scores-e2-5-million/,"The portfolio company of Swedish venture builder EPTI, Apotekamo, has just scored €2.5 million in funding. The online pharmacy is focusing on Southeast Europe and footballer Hasan Salihamidžic is a new backer. Apotekamo was first launched in Serbia before expanding to Bosnia and Herzegovina during the first quarter of 2022. The company offers a digital pharmacy experience for consumers and suppliers. It boasts a range of both over-the-counter and prescription drugs, as well as digital services such as order processing and payment solutions for external suppliers on Aptekamo’s platform. Now, the startup has secured a €2.5 million capital investment to fuel further geographical expansion. The funding came from angel funder collective Angelgate AG and FC Bayern Munich’s Sporting Director, former Bosnian professional footballer Hasan “Brazzo” Salihamidžić. Srdjan Milic, CEO of Apotekamo, commented: “We are delighted with the trust from existing and new investors, especially given the current market climate and the geopolitical situation. It feels great to find common ground on our vision to do good for society and simultaneously become the leading online pharmacy in Southeast Europe. During the first half-year period of 2022, Apotekamo increased its order intake by 740 percent compared with the corresponding period last year.” The Swedish company has also shared that it has a pre-money valuation of €14.6 million following this new investment. As a part of the financing, Hasan “Brazzo” Salihamidžić became Apotekamo’s third-largest shareholder and will also support its marketing activities. Hasan Salihamidžić, Sporting Director of Bayern Munich, said: “I am very impressed by Apotekamo’s fast growth and its management. The company has a proven concept in other markets, so it is only a matter of time before the same applies to the rest of Europe. I see a great opportunity in strengthening the healthcare market in my home region and very much look forward to supporting the company in various marketing activities.” Arli Mujkic, CEO and Founder of EPTI, commented: “We are pleased to continue to support Apotekamo in its growth journey. The company is a typical EPTI case, where we are involved in launching, developing, and upscaling a niche player on a digitally immature market. Apotekamo has made great operational progress over the past year and has seen strong growth in both returning customers and orders. We are happy and proud to have Hasan Salihamidžić on board, an internationally recognised football personality who will contribute to increased visibility.”"

2022.8.8,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/london-based-katkin-picks-up-e21-6-million-to-bring-its-healthier-cat-food-to-pet-parents-across-the-world/,"PetTech startup KatKin has just secured about €21.6 million for its platform aiming to bring fresh and healthy food to cats worldwide. Based in London, the cat food company is taking on a growing market and scaling fast. PetTech is enjoying an upward spiral at the moment with the sector seeing lots of fresh innovation, investment and growing market potential. Pet parents are willing to spend on products that keep their beloved friends healthy and happy, and investors and innovators are taking notice. Pet food in particular has interesting market potential. The traditional cat food kibble hasn’t really changed over the decades, and cat owners are starting to look for new alternatives that are made with improved research-based recipes. Owners are starting to question the ingredients in cat food brands, and question the claimed benefits – finding that many food blends are actually made with low-quality fillers, untraceable ‘meat and animal derivatives’ and additives hidden behind hard-to-understand labels. Poorly formulated diets can make cats unhappy, unwell, or overweight, with obesity now one of the top five welfare issues facing cats worldwide. Taking this on to bring freshly-cooked and personally tailored catfood to homes across the world, KatKin has secured €21.6 million in new funding. The Funding The Series A funding was led by Verlinvest and Perwyn, along with previous investor Octopus Ventures and strategic angels. The funding will be used by KatKin to invest in personalised health plans for cats, invest in more scientific research, and, develop new fresh recipes.  To that end, the brand is expanding its world-first fresh-cooked manufacturing site for cats, creating new jobs within KatKin’s growing team. Using a data-driven approach, its researchers are poised to develop further science-forward solutions to issues making cats unwell, from diabetes to renal disease. Lopo Champalimaud, Board Director, Verlinvest, said: “I am very excited to partner with Brett, Nikki and the KatKin team on their journey to revolutionise the pet food sector by offering healthy and fresh cat food at competitive prices. This is a sector that Verlinvest has been looking at for some time and KatKin is exactly the kind of innovative and disruptive brand that we love to support on its way to global leadership. Our cats deserve better. ” KatKin: Providing 100% fresh-cooked meals for cats Founded in 2019 by sibling duo Brett and Nikki O’Farrell, KatKin is on track to become the cat food brand that pet parents can trust, with an uncompromising commitment to cats’ wellbeing. Brett O’Farrell, KatKin co-founder explained: “KatKin began when Nikki and I questioned what we were feeding our cats Molly, Kiki and Columbus. The more we asked, the more horrified we were at what we found. So we gathered an ambitious, world-class team of people willing to stick their noses up at the cat food chain. Right now, mainstream cat food is stale – packed with cheap ingredients, hard-to-understand labels and fluffed-up claims.  It’s difficult to find what’s best and customers are frustrated. In contrast, the demand is huge for KatKin – every six months we’re doubling in size and customer base. We’re grateful to Lopo and Cecile at Verlinvest and Andrew at Perwyn, as well as for the continued support from Octopus and our angel investors. This support doesn’t just invest in our business but also the health and happiness of cats and cat parents.” The brand has developed an ecommerce platform with a proprietary algorithm that helps customers build personalised boxes of fresh meals, perfectly portioned to their cat’s unique traits: their age, weight, activity level, body shape and favourite flavours. The food replicates what cats evolved to eat in the wild – a high-quality protein, high moisture and grain-free diet such as that found in fresh meat. The product is also formulated by a board-certified veterinary nutritionist and each recipe uses 100% human-grade meat. The London-based company also manages the supply chain from sourcing to shipping, so its product is not just free from preservatives, fillers and mysterious so-called animal derivatives, but is also more personal, and avoids becoming mass-produced. The subscription service is available for about £1.75 a day- making it good value for money for consumers. Market growth While startups are beginning to fill in the cracks of the pet food industry, around 96% of venture capital funding goes to dog-first founders, overlooking a cat market that is expected to be worth around €50 billion by 2030, the fastest-growing sector in global pet food. Legacy brands taking advantage of this have merely polished their marketing without fundamentally improving what cats eat. KatKin is already feeding about 80k cats across the UK and the team has reported that over 90% of cat parents report real-life improvements: 62% said their cat was more playful and energetic, 65% felt shiny, strokable coats and more than half reported improved digestion, as well as fewer trips to the vets. All better results at 25% less cost than existing premium brands. Nikki O’Farrell, KatKin co-founder added: “We’re cat parents that love hard. Cat wellbeing happens to be our profession but it’s our passion first. And it shows – we’re the highest-rated cat food brand on Trustpilot. It’s all about creating awareness among cat parents, bringing them together as a community to drive change in the cat food industry. With fresh, personalised and individual meals costing less than other premium brands and most mid-market brands, we’re on a mission to get all cats thriving.” In the coming years, KatKin strives to raise every area of cat well-being to the standard cats deserve.

2022.8.9,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/leuven-based-dphi-picks-up-e300k-to-develop-global-ai-marketplace/,"On a mission to develop a global community-based AI marketplace, DPhi has just secured €300k of fresh funding. The Leuven-headquartered startup is aiming to make AI education accessible to everyone. Artificial Intelligence is driving innovation and tech development across the world. It’s being harnessed to address some of the key challenges of today’s world, as well as make businesses and societies run more efficiently. It’s a tech development that we now rely on. Building a global AI marketplace to democratize how AI is used, DPhi has just secured €300k to expand. The Funding The strategic seed funding was raised from Selçuk Boydak, a serial AI entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist. Selçuk has been successfully building innovative companies for over 20 years, primarily in Switzerland, and is currently focusing on the global roll-out of a unique AI ecosystem. Selçuk Boydak, said: “I am excited to join forces with DPhi, its visionary leaders and talented team. Together we will create the leading global AI community, educating and actively supporting the next generation of AI talents and entrepreneurs around the world”. DPhi is currently backed by Start it @KBC, Startup Chile, and Microsoft for Startups. Global AI Community Headquartered in Belgium and India, DPhi was born with the vision to make AI education accessible to everyone and build AI for good to solve key challenges of humanity. As part of its community initiatives, DPhi provides free AI and data science courses by industry experts from large tech companies or startups worldwide. Over 100K+ learners from 150+ countries have already benefitted since its 2020 launch. In addition to the valuable educational component ton the platform, DPhi also comprises a Crowdsourcing AI Platform which empowers the community members to apply their skills to solve real-world problems.

Soon, the company will launch a global AI marketplace with ready-to-use AI solutions (algorithms) built by the best data scientists worldwide. DPhi’s founder Chanukya, explained: “There is a significant vacuum in the industry as a result of which companies struggle to drive impact with AI projects. Organizations often find it hard to build robust AI expertise, and over 85% of projects fail to drive impact. Right now, the adoption of AI that we are seeing is just due to the application of AI at large tech companies. We are yet to harness the full potential of AI across industries and companies of all sizes.  As AI is rapidly evolving, its education, awareness and adoption of development practices are more important than ever for each one of us. With DPhi, we aim to prepare the world for the AI era by educating and building AI for the people, by the people.” Making AI Accessible DPhi was recently included in the Startup Chile programme, supported by the Chilean government, giving the team a foothold in another continent. It means now they have the chance to establish a strong presence and carry out an AI strategy in the underserved Latin American region, in addition to the home bases of Europe and India. Chanukya added: “Today, every company is a tech company. Soon, every company will be AI-driven, and DPhi will equip them with AI essentials. We were humbled by the interest from a few notable investors and delighted to close this particular strategic investment. It is extremely relevant to us, aligns with our community-driven approach, and allows us to expand rapidly. Selçuk’s business leadership and our collaboration with his Swiss AI scale- ups will enable us to surge our impact in shaping the future of the AI ecosystem.” As part of this strategic investment, DPhi will intensify its collaboration with the Swiss scale-up companies AI Business School and Global AI Hub to create a unique global AI ecosystem. The joint mission is to prepare the world for the AI era and develop the next generation of AI entrepreneurs and changemakers"
2022.8.9,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/personal-training-app-another-round-lifts-new-capital-to-strengthen-its-market-position/,"Pumping up the mission to make personal training more accessible, London-based Another Round has just secured new investment from Pure Gym founder, Peter Roberts. The sports tech startup is revolutionising the fitness space, aiming to make it more personal and accessible. Health and fitness are becoming digitised. There are few people who don’t have some type of health and/or fitness app installed on their phone and industry experts and trainers are increasingly using tech to enhance performance and make sports even more competitive. Tech is also being used to make health and fitness more accessible. Training and holistic health has long been seen as an expensive game, but now, Another Round is aiming to change that, making the traditionally pricey personal training option affordable. Backed by industry leaders Another Round’s unique approach to fitness and training has attracted attention from leaders in the pace. Pure Gym founder and former CEO has now invested a six-figure sum into the startup. Joining Roberts, Jacques de Bruin the ex-COO of Pure Gym and other ex-senior Pure Gym team members have also invested. Roberts will join the board to support further growth plans. Max Cotton, founder and CEO of Another Round stated: “We’re here to give everyone access to personalised, highly effective workouts and trainers – transforming their physical health. Another Round was created to make health and fitness more accessible than ever before and we’re incredibly excited to have an industry titan like Peter onboard – recognising the shift in how consumers want to buy and experience personal training.” The Another Round team of 5, based in South London, which was bootstrapped from launch, raised its first round of investment in 2021, mostly from angels and its members. Following 20k+ workouts completed by members and four years of data, it’s now raising its second round of investment, including the welcoming of fitness industry icons. Taking AI to Personal Training Founded by Max Cotton in 2018, an ex-professional MMA fighter turned fitness tech entrepreneur, Another Round applies its proprietary artificial intelligence to personal training, making it more accessible, convenient and effective than ever. Max stated: “The pandemic showed us huge personal gains when we embrace remote services – time is one of the biggest barriers for people to exercise and by bringing a train anywhere, anytime personal training solution to the market, we’re reducing the time it takes to exercise and making it more convenient to invest in your health. We fit plans to a member’s lifestyle, not the other way round. This approach is why our members love us and get great results.” “We believe in the importance of a human relationship between trainer and member, with AI creating a collective intelligence that enables us to scale and facilitate exceptional results for our members ”. Personal training has always been expensive and relies on a model of in-person sessions in a gym or training centre. With Another Round, users can access training sessions in-app, with personalised guides and videos of all exercises, tailored to clients’ goals, equipment (gym or at-home), ability, injuries, and support from a dedicated coach. Another Round uses AI to automate tasks, rather than jobs. And whilst other AI fitness companies are trying to replace human trainers completely, the company believes that working alongside and with AI is far more beneficial. Strong market potential The World Economic Forum recently released a study that reveals global downloads of fitness and health apps surged 46% owing to the higher adoption of online fitness training. With this in mind, Roberts believes consumers are willing to pay a monthly fee in order to have access to a tailored service that works on their time frame. The virtual fitness business is using the investment to accelerate the growth of its community, build a world-class team of coaches and advance its product capabilities. With a loyal consumer customer base and plans to enter the corporate market in 2023, the investment places the company in a strong position to capitalise on the growth of the online fitness market, projected to exceed €30 billion in 2026. Peter Roberts added: “Another Round is a category creator, moving personal training from a one-to-one service to a hive mind of expertise, coupled with an innovative delivery model. Now is the perfect time for Another Round to disrupt how personal training has traditionally been sold. Max’s background and attitude combined with the app’s member advocacy impressed me and I’m excited to be on the journey with them to build and lead the way in a new virtual fitness category.”"
2022.8.9,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/berlin-based-green-generation-fund-has-raised-e100-million-to-fuel-food-tech-and-green-tech-innovatio/,"Impact investors Green Generation Fund has announced its first generation €100 million fund. The Berlin-based team are investing in Europe and the US, supporting innovators that are creating more sustainable approaches and solutions. The impact investment space is starting to pick up pace. It’s now being increasingly recognised that investment and impact can go hand in hand. Entrepreneurs, businesses and organisations are now starting to build processes and strategies that are underpinned by sustainability and it seems like a new era, or generation, of green investment is emerging. Recently, the Portuguese impact finance platform GoParity announced it was accepting overfunding after the successful launch of its crowdfunding campaign. Nordic-headquartered Summa Equity expanded across the Atlantic and we have had funds like Polestar Capital’s €100 million fund open up. At EU-Startups, we have also chatted to prominent food tech investors, impact investors such as Tim He and green tech entrepreneurs like Ellen Moeller to learn more about how Europe is paving the way in sustainability and impact-driven ventures. Now, a Berlin-based firm has joined the mission: Green Generation Fund, a women-led firm dedicated to food and green tech innovation. Green Generation Fund Founded in 2021, Green Generation Fund is turning heads for a couple of reasons. The fund invests in disruptive technologies at seed stages to enable breakthroughs in food tech and green tech – two verticals that are crucial in shaping the future. The firm supports passionate, mission-driven founders who build game-changing companies within the realm of environmental sustainability, the single most urgent goal of humankind. It’s entirely female-led, which is, unfortunately, still a rarity in the investment space. It was launched in Berlin by Dr. Manon Sarah Littek and Janna Ensthaler. Manon has held roles as Board Director at Upfield (world’s largest, KKR-backed plant-based company) former sole GP at Katjesgreenfood (Europe’s first branded food impact investor) and DLD Ventures (CVC vehicle of Hubert Burda Media’s digital branch). Meanwhile, Janna is a former management consultant (Bain & Company), Al Gore Antarctica Alumni and is a serial entrepreneur founder of several start-ups in various verticals including food (Kaiserwetter), cosmetics (Glossybox) and software (Event Inc). Dr. Manon Sarah Littek said: “Our actions in the next three years will define how we will live as humankind in the decades and generations to come. It’s a turning point to a liveable future and we believe that the solutions will be found in disruptive innovations and bold moves from strong entrepreneurs in the field of green tech and food tech. We want to select and back these entrepreneurs and be part of the solution.” Janna Ensthaler commented: “I am convinced that we can make the German and European economy fit for the future, above all, by identifying the ecosystems of the future today and then building them up as quickly as possible in competition with other regions of the world and occupying them for ourselves. Our food tech and green tech investment categories are two of the most important future industries of the coming decades.” The Fund Investing across Europe and the US, Green Generation Fund has announced its €100 million fund. It’s already backed its first 8 portfolio companies and will deploy the capital across 20-25 ventures in food tech and green tech. Since the inception of the Green Generation Fund, the two founding partners have co-led the funding rounds of eight portfolio companies, including Neggst (first vegan egg with separated yolk / white / shell), Biomilq (cell-cultured breast milk), Libre (meat substitutes based on mycelium/fungi), Lypid (plant-based solution mimicking fat tissue), Change Foods (cheese substitute based on recombinant protein) and The Rainforest Company (superfood protecting the amazon rainforest) in food tech as well as Klim (carbon offsetting app to promote regenerative agriculture) and One Five (R&D platform for plastic packaging alternatives) in green tech. Janna: “We rely on founders who develop solutions for the big problems of our time. Our start-up Neggst alone, which can do away with mass-laying batteries for eggs and instead offer plant-based alternatives, can save around 1% of global CO2 emissions through resource-saving production.” The startups receiving investment all share something in common – they are using tech to fuel a transformation towards a more sustainable, ethical and healthy global ecosystem. They leverage developments in the fields of carbon emissions, circular economy, resource and climate protection, animal welfare, biodiversity and health promotion. Janna Ensthaler commented: “Not only players like Bill Gates (book “How to avoid a Climate Crisis), Elon Musk (100M Fund launched in 2021 for the best carbon capturing methods), or Larry Fink, CEO of Black Rock (the largest investment company in the world) talk about the topic of CO2 reduction and sustainability as the most important topic of our time. Governments around the world are also increasingly recognizing the obligation to promote this topic both through strong regulations and massive subsidies. Generation Z and Millennials are also fed up with factory farming and a life that pushes our blue planet to its limits. These generations in particular will insist on the plant-based food revolution and the incorporation of CO2-reducing and more sustainable measures. This is where we invest.” Influential backers The fund’s LP base includes, next to anchor investors Kaltroco (UK family office) and Florian Wendelstadt (former MD General Atlantic), a number of other well-known international investors such as Canica (Switzerland/Norway), Corecam Capital Partners (Singapore) and Liesner & Co. (Hamburg). This is in addition to several mission-driven high-net-worth individuals. Funds such as Equation and Aldea, as well as institutional investors such as KfW Capital have also made significant contributions. It’s also gained traction with industry experts such as Susan Danziger with Albert Wenger (Eutopia), Ex Aldi CEO Dr. Marc Heussinger, Peter Dill (Deutsche See), Dr. Anne-Marie Großmann (Georgsmarienhütte) and Babor (Aachen) are invested in the GGF as well as founders and multipliers such as Delia Lachance (Westwing), Lea Cramer (Amorelie) and Verena Pausder (“Das Neue Land”). Dr. Manon Sarah Littek added: “We differentiate ourselves from other impact funds in the space through sector expertise and a clear focus on a few, selectively chosen categories. The green revolution, which began just a few years ago in the food sector with sustainability-oriented, plant-based retail brands, now extends across the entire value chain of food products and related consumer goods. As part of our investment strategy, we usually invest with the ambition to obtain significant shareholdings (10%+) in companies with technology-centric solutions and accompany them throughout the entire growth phase until the exit.”"
2022.8.9,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/london-based-auddy-picks-up-e2-95-million-for-its-premium-podcasting-platform/,"Providing end-to-end audio podcasting solutions to creators, advertisers and businesses, Auddy has just picked up €2.95 million. The London-based startup is now planning further growth and content development. Podcasts are continuing to grow as one of the most popular forms of content consumption. Many of us now find ourselves listening to podcasts as we go about our daily lives – whether it’s during the daily commute or whilst cleaning up the house, podcasts are an increasingly common companion. From the political podcasts fuelling insightful discussions on the world around us, to the community-based, mental health and wellbeing series, not to mention informative guides and funny anecdotes – the podcasting space is huge and there is something for everyone to listen to. We actually recently curated a list of 10 podcasts we recommend for budding founders and startup enthusiasts. Going for market glory, London-based Auddy has just picked up about €2.95 million to make its mark with its speciality platform for publishing, marketing and distribution of podcasts. The Funding The round was led by Pembroke VCT and backed by existing investors Haatch Ventures and Brick Capital Ventures. It’ll be used to help support further growth plans as well as fuel investment in tech and content development. Andrew Craissati, founder and CEO of Auddy said: “Meeting Pembroke and working with Simon, Fred and Angus have been a thoroughly enjoyable and professional experience. From the first meeting between the Pembroke and Auddy teams, the detailed but agile approach has been refreshingly indicative of exciting times for the future of our partnership.” Premium podcast platform Founded in 2020 by Andrew Craissati, Auddy is an end-to-end podcast publishing solution. The platform aims to support creators, advertisers and businesses to create and market premium episodes. It focuses on buying and selling inventory in podcasts across the U.K., Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as reducing podcasts. It also offers a private podcasting service to help organisations share audio content directly with their targeted community in a more exclusive environment. Audio content consumption is growing – there are now an estimated 23 million weekly podcast listeners in the UK alone. Researches consist this growth will continue at over 25% through to 2028 and beyond, thanks to more investment and creativity with content and continued listener interest. Auddy already has recorded over 4,000 podcast shows, 12 million monthly downloads and 11 million downloads in the UK. Popular titles include Science-ish, Inside the Tour and Smoke Screen. Simon Porter, investment director of Pembroke Investment Managers added: “Auddy offers a unique and exciting prospect to businesses looking to use audio as a core part of their communications toolset and is poised to take advantage of surging growth in the podcasting sector over the coming years.”"
2022.8.10,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/berlin-based-junto-scores-e5-million-for-its-innovative-digital-learning-platform/,"Edtech startup Junto has just secured €5 million in Seed funding for its digital learning platform. The Berlin-based team is taking a holistic approach to learning, combining tech with interactive, live experiences and a learner community. The world of work has been dogged by two major challenges in recent years – a global talent shortage and the ‘great resignation’. While these two phenomena show no sign of fixing themselves, it’s become clear to businesses and organisations that in order to future-proof themselves with a strong and impactful cohort of leaders and talent, they need to develop employees’ skills, across the duration of their career. Meanwhile, employees expect professional development to come part and parcel with their role. Employees want to progress and develop, to feel part of the growing company, and companies need to facilitate this. It’s brought about a shift in employee/employer relations, and a new wave of edtech and digital learning has sprung up. Putting its hat into the ring to boost the sector is Junto – the Berlin-based digital learning platform. The startup has today announced a raise of €5 million to grow. The funding Just three months after picking up €1.2 million from over 40 well-known business angels, the edtech startup has now raised an additional €5 million – an extremely promising reflection of the startup’s potential. The new capital was led by Earlybird with participation from Picus Capital, Emerge Capital and 10+ top business angels. This is the first time that the company, which was only launched in January, has brought institutional investors on board for further growth. A hybrid approach to digital learning As the search for talent becomes increasingly competitive and companies have begun to recognise the importance of developing their employee’s skills, digital learning is becoming a fast-growing market. However, most organizations are still working with an inefficient puzzle of different training providers, freelance coaches and internal learning & development programs. It’s been well proven by incumbent providers of digital learning just how effective it can be, however, learning in business settings is still associated with passive online videos, dull hotel seminars, or local instructors without relevant practical experience. It’s even reported that the market for corporate training remains 90% offline – something Junto is aiming to change. Founded by Marius Hepp (MD), Johannes Schnell-Kretschmer (MD), and Feliks Eyser (Chairman) in January 2022, Junto’s solution combines a scalable learning platform with interactive online training and a cross-company peer community. What sets Junto further apart is its unique network of international experts who share their hands-on experiences in interactive live sessions, including top executives from Google, Amazon, Adobe, Delivery Hero, Gorillas and N26. Co-founder Marius Hepp explains: “Our vision goes far beyond a learning platform: With Junto, we democratize the access for talents & organizations across the globe to directly learn from world-class tech operators. This provides them with the opportunity to unleash their full professional potential.” Key to setting the platform apart from competitors is the pioneering hybrid approach. With Junto, users access quality online content alongside interactive live experiences and a cohort-based learner community. It’s reported that while less than 13% of the courses started on Udemy, Coursera or LinkedIn Learning are actually finalized, Junto’s cohort-based approach enables a completion rate of over 95%. Market potential Already, Junto has brought on almost 100 corporate clients, including successful scale-ups such as Everphone, Sendinblue or Hive. Hive’s Head of Human Resources Benjamin Böhmer commented: “In the first months of our partnership with Junto, we were already able to significantly increase the leadership skills, motivation and impact of our team members. Junto offers us a competitive advantage in the war for the best talents.” It’s only the beginning for Junto though. Founded just this year, and already receiving significant traction with investors and clients, it’s clear the startup has exciting market potential. This new funding will be used to accelerate building the team up, developing the proprietary software platform, as well as broadening the content and instructor exosystem. Co-founder Johannes Schnell-Kretschmer, said: “Our new Seed financing round is an important step to realize this vision: In addition to the unique network of our 50+ business angels, the capital and experience of Earlybird, Picus Capital and Emerge Education will allow us to accelerate the execution of our strategy.” Paul Klemm, Partner at Earlybird said: ”Talent development is key for the long-term success of every company. Yet, B2B education has remained largely unchanged for decades. We are convinced that Junto’s operator-driven and community-based approach will make corporate learning significantly more effective and are excited to partner with the team on their journey to empower professionals and organizations globally.”"
2022.8.10,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/dutch-medtech-startup-xeltis-secures-e15-million-to-develop-pioneering-medical-treatments/,"Xeltis, a Dutch medtech startup, has secured €15 million of fresh investment from Chinese firm, Grand Pharma. The startup is developing medical devices to treat cardiovascular disease and as a result, aims to lessen the incidence of CKD. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is reported to affect 9% of the population – and its prevalence is growing due to a simultaneous increase in cardiovascular diseases around the world (including diabetes, hypertension and diabetes). CKD is now accounting for more deaths than breast and prostate cancers combined. Traditional hemodialysis is overwhelmed with demand, and patients are now experiencing long waiting times to get access to the treatment they need. Xeltis is developing polymer-based restorative devices for cardiovascular treatment. The restorative devices include implantable small diameter blood vessels for hemodialysis vascular access and for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and pulmonary heart valves, for which clinical trials are ongoing. The aim is that these devices can provide more durable, transformative treatment options for patients worldwide. To develop the product, the Dutch startup has just picked up €15 million in new investment. The Funding Agreement Chinese company, Grand Pharmaceutical Group Ltd (0512.HK), has just committed to investing €15 million in equity and license fees, as a cornerstone funding for its ongoing Series D2 financing round. The Grand Pharma commitment comprises an equity investment and product license, representing Xeltis’ first commercial deal and its first funding from an Asian company. The agreement, which focuses mainly on Xeltis’ restorative hemodialysis access device aXess, also involves other new products in the field of hemodialysis developed under the same technology platform. Grand Pharma will also have exclusive rights of development, production and commercialization, as well as pre-emptive negotiation rights for Xeltis’ products developed in other indications in the Greater China region. Eliane Schutte, Xeltis CEO, commented: “Grand Pharma’s commitment to invest in Xeltis brings global validation of aXess’ commercial potential from one of the largest Chinese life sciences companies, from the country with the largest need of hemodialysis access globally. It confirms the strength of our technology platform and clinical evidence to date, and supports our goal of providing potentially more durable, transformative restorative devices for patients worldwide.” Xeltis’ investors include venture capital funds EQT Life Sciences, Kurma Partners, VI Partners and Ysios Capital as well as a number of private investors. In 2021, Xeltis secured €15 million financing from the European Investment Bank and €15 million funding from the European Innovation Council Accelerator (EIC) set up by the European Commission. Xeltis: Developing the aXess Graft Founded through the merger of Dutch/Swiss university spin-offs, Xeltis’ flagship product, the aXess Graft is showing promising signs for the treatment of CKD – with the potential to impact millions of lives. The Xeltis aXess graft is a restorative, synthetic, biocompatible and absorbable electrospun blood vessel for arteriovenous hemodialysis access, over time turning into a living vessel made of the patient’s own tissue. Once implanted, its biocompatible, porous micro-structure gets naturally colonized by the patient’s own tissue, which over time takes over functionality before the original device absorbs in the body. This process is called endogenous tissue restoration (ETR). aXess combines a potentially longer-lasting and readily available vascular access of suitable dialysis size, turned into a living, a natural graft made of the patient’s own tissue. It’s still under clinical trials, but showing promising early data outcomes. While CKD is a global problem, China is believed to be the country with the largest number of CKD patients in the world, accounting for about 130 million people, of which around 580,000 are currently on hemodialysis. The number of people on hemodialysis in China is projected to increase by 15% in the next five years. Xeltis’ product, and the additional devices being developed, have the potential to tackle this growing problem and this fresh investment will help fuel these ambitions. Grand Pharmaceutical Group CEO, Frank Zho: “Grand Pharma is building interventional diagnosis and treatment platform for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in China. Xeltis’ aXess device would represent an excellent addition to the scope of our broad portfolio and expected to bring significant clinical impact in China.”"
2022.8.10,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/why-your-startup-needs-a-powerful-modern-crm-solution-sponsored/,"Founding, launching, and scaling a startup is normally done with a common objective – becoming a success As about 90% of startups actually fail, it’s clear that it’s not so simple to be successful – especially if you want to go global and make it big time. There’s a reason the startups with the highest valuations are called unicorns – they’re a pretty rare phenomenon. To make it work, startups need to leverage every tool at their disposal. Make every resource count and make every process as efficient and streamlined as possible. A CRM is a critical part of this. Startups often make the error of assuming that a CRM is a surplus to requirement – believing them to be reserved for medium or large businesses. But that’s not the case. They hold incredible value for small, resource-stricken startups as well. What is a CRM? A CRM (customer relationship management) is a tool used to optimize the full spectrum of customer management and business operations. It’s a software system used to help build, nurture and have oversight on customer relationships, as well as with other organisations, shareholders, team members, investors, suppliers and so on. It helps with time management, organisation, lead generation, business management and communication. CRM solutions include various features to boost a team’s efficiency. This includes the ability to enable teams to organize and manage basic information (such as contact details), give easy access to customer/shareholder profiles and related interactions with them, integrate business workflows and create automation to increase engagement. CRM can also generate more sales, identify marketing opportunities, and, ensures customer retention – to name just a few. What’s the benefit to a startup? CRMs give a workspace for startup teams to have complete oversight over the full spectrum of their business processes. It harnesses all of the possible accumulated data at every point of a business journey and pulls it together. For a startup – this is incredibly powerful. Small, dynamic teams can benefit from the slick, streamlined automation – optimising time and enhancing efficiency. Here, we take a look at 4 fundamental ways a CRM can benefit startups:  Get your startup organized Boost customer retention and acquisition Funding oversight Empower collaboration  We’ll focus on these four elements, as we think they are most relevant for startups, but there are a whole host of other benefits. Freshworks’ product Freshsales Suite is an example of a quality CRM dedicated to startups, you can check out their core benefits here. Get organized It’s a data-driven world, and we’re just living in it. In 2022 and beyond, data has immense power and startups need to have it well organised to be able to leverage it appropriately. CRMs provide a way to store data and information in an organised way. This, in turn, organises and informs processes and empowers better data-driven decisions. A CRM gives a visual overview of all the relevant insights and formation. It can be pulled up when needed and constantly updated. The additional benefit of the modern CRM is that in today’s world, spreadsheets just don’t cut it. A CRM means that data and business information is optimised and more efficient, which as a result enhances time management. From workflows and tools to help create, manage and allocate tasks to the ability to generate reports, a CRM is the organisation tool every fast-growing company needs to take advantage of. Customer acquisition and retention Getting the first customers onboarded is the lifeblood of any startup’s journey. After that, the tricky work begins – retaining customers. A quality CRM system can help in both onboarding new customers, identifying them in the first place, and ensuring that your startup develops a reputation for delivering excellent customer service – essential for customer retention and long-term success. CRMs track all customer deals, interactions, transactions and so forth – basically any contact between every customer and your company can be tracked, recorded and analysed by a CRM. Knowing your customer inside and out means you can predict their wants and needs, which means you can cater to them and optimise whole business processes. It is the best friend for both sales and marketing teams, giving the important insights to launch lead generation campaigns, ways to close the sales funnel and identifying marketing opportunities. CRMs also benefit from social media integrations which can be priceless in maintaining customer engagement across your entire network. Funding oversight One benefit of a quality CRM tool for startups is the ability it gives to keep track of funding. It can be used to track existing investors as well as identify ways to attract new investors. It also generates powerful reports and insights – which are useful to have on hand to show investors why they should be putting their money into your pocket. The oversight and the data provided by a CRM have great potential to fuel your funding strategy. Empowering collaboration Yes, we know startups are small. So buying into a tool that helps teams work together more efficient might not seem so important. But, as a startup, your aim is to grow. That means taking on new team members. In addition, startups are increasingly characterised by disparate, remote-based steams. With a CRM, new team members can be easily onboarded and brought up to speed with what’s going on, the key objectives, and what’s happened in the past. It also helps team members have oversight of what’s happening across departments and teams. The startup world is well known to be full of workers wearing multiple hats. Collaboration tools make that possible, giving marketing teams an eye on what’s happening with sales, and business developers up to date with what the devs have up their sleeves. With a CRM, data is shared easily and it’s all made accessible to everyone, regardless of where they are or when they started or who they are. They can also be tailored to assign tasks, set up notifications, run performance analysis, share calendars, set up collaborative chats, and generally have more visibility when and if it is needed. Freshworks for Startups Freshworks has created a CRM solution specifically catering to startups and their unique needs – Freshsales Suite. Freshsales Suite is a powerful, modern CRM solution that combines the power of sales and marketing automation, chat, and telephony in a single, comprehensive solution. Using a CRM like Freshsales Suite means you can focus on what you do best – scaling your business – rather than getting bogged down in burdensome manual work. Germain Brion, VP-Sales of startup Chargebee: “We initially had Salesforce CRM but didn’t really use it. The instance was incredibly complicated because it allows for so much customization that you end up doing nothing. When we explored Freshsales Suite, the first thing I remember saying is, okay, the interface is clean and simple.” The Freshworks for Startups programme includes a global community of 400+ VCs, accelerators, incubators, and startup communities from 87 countries – all fuelled by its omnichannel model.

2022.8.10,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/uk-based-patchwork-health-raises-e24-million-to-tackle-the-healthcare-staffing-crisis/,"Healthtech startup Patchwork Health has just raised €24 million to address the growing staffing crisis in the healthcare sector. Built by doctors for doctors, the platform is now planning to expand from the UK across European and international markets. A global pandemic, drastic funding cuts, labour shortages, and supply chain issues. Just a couple of things the healthcare sector has had to deal with in the past decade (if not longer). It means that now, healthcare providers across Europe are in a state of crisis. Healthcare staff are bearing the brunt of it, with shocking numbers suffering from burnout and work-related stress. It’s been reported that, in the UK, nearly half of all healthcare staff have felt unwell as a result of work-related stress in the last 12 months and 1 in 5 have said they are likely to leave their organisation in the next year. This staffing crunch is occurring against the backdrop of record waiting lists, with 6.6 million people waiting to start treatment. And these trends are being reflected across the continent. Aiming to do something about it, Patchwork Health is scaling up. Patchwork Health: By Doctors for Doctors Founded in 2016 by NHS medics, Dr Anas Nader and Dr Jing Ouyang, Patchwork Health is a pioneering healthcare workforce platform. It provides tech-powered solutions that address staffing challenges and allow healthcare teams to manage their permanent and temporary workforces through one fully-integrated platform. Co-Founder and CEO, Dr Anas Nader, commented: “Healthcare staff are resilient, resourceful and deeply committed to their work. But they’re not super heroes. As the world of work shifts around them, staff are locked into rigid schedules whilst demand escalates. This is pushing clinicians out of healthcare careers as they’re too exhausted to continue. And that heaps further pressure on those who remain. It’s a vicious cycle we can ill-afford. Too many clinicians have, like myself and my co-founder, found themselves trapped in a schedule which can grind you down and push you out of a career you love.” We chatted to Dr Anas Nader earlier this year to find out more about his inspiring story of being a doctor-turned-entrepreneur after suffering burnout. Patchwork’s offering includes powering tech-enabled ‘staff banks’ for temporary workers – the vital clinicians who step in when a shift can’t be filled by a permanent member of staff. The Patchwork model radically reduces reliance on the expensive locum agency ‘middle man’ and instead gives hospitals the power to increase engagement with existing temporary staff, access new networks of clinicians directly, and broadcast all their shifts through an app. It saves hospitals money, ensures healthcare settings are safely staffed and offers all clinicians a desperately needed route to a more flexible and sustainable way of working. The startup also helps healthcare organisations team up with others in their region to create ‘collaborative staff banks’; making it possible for them to pool their networks of temporary staff and allow clinicians to safely move between hospitals easily and work where they are needed most. Patchwork is behind the largest collaborative staffing bank in the UK, having brought 24 organisations in the North West together to help ease staffing pressures in the region. And for permanent healthcare staff, the Patchwork platform offers rostering software and solutions which transform how they work. Their technology enables staff to have their personal needs and preferences factored into their rota, promoting better work-life balance and stemming the flow of staff resigning due to burnout. Crucially, Patchwork makes this flexibility for clinicians compatible with safely staffed wards by giving rota managers the tools and access to data they need for effective and dynamic workforce planning. This represents a huge step-change for healthcare, where rigid rostering has long been a hallmark of staffing. Dr Anas Nadar added: “Healthcare staffing isn’t working for healthcare staff; but it can be fixed with the right tools. At Patchwork, we work closely with healthcare organisations to design technology-powered solutions that allow all staff to have their needs, preferences, and wellbeing put front and centre of workforce strategies. Our solution gives the healthcare sites the power to make this sustainable staffing a reality, whilst improving staffing levels and safeguarding the quality of patient care. We’re so grateful to Perwyn and all the investors involved in this round for enabling us to scale up this mission and help even more healthcare professionals work in a sustainable way.” The Funding Today, the impact-driven startup has announced a €24 million capital injection at a pertinent moment in the healthcare space. The Series B round was led by Perwyn and backed by Praetura Ventures and KHP Ventures. They were joined by a range of prominent angel investors, including Monzo founder Tom Blomfield and Social Chain Co-founder Dominic McGregor. Martin le Huray, Partner at Perwyn, said: “Anas, Jing and their team are building a truly game-changing solution for the NHS. The traditional way of staffing our NHS is outdated and is contributing to the pressures our health service is facing. Their track record of working closely with the NHS to affect change is very impressive and we are delighted to have led this round. We believe that Patchwork is well on its way to playing a pivotal role in creating a stronger, more sustainable healthcare system for future generations.” Now, with this fresh funding, the team are ready to accelerate expansion into wider European and international markets and bring their services to new areas of health and a wider range of sectors. David Foreman, Managing Director at Praetura Ventures, said: “As long-standing partners of Patchwork, we want to continue to support their team as they scale. Their team is motivated by a unifying purpose; to make life better for NHS staff and to secure better outcomes for patients. This fuels everything they do and is the passion behind their ongoing success. We can’t wait to continue on this journey with them as they go from strength to strength.” Patchwork, which has scaled its team to over 100, will use this investment to further strengthen its customer-facing teams, ensuring all healthcare partners continue to receive the hands-on, proactive support needed to make each roll-out a success, alongside expansion into new global markets and a wider range of sectors. Daniel Dickens, Co-Managing Partner at KHP Ventures, added: “As an early-stage fund anchored by one the UK’s largest healthcare systems, it was a natural fit to support two brilliant clinical entrepreneurs in Anas and Jing, and their talented team, to scale a platform that addresses one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS. We were incredibly impressed with their roadmap and traction to date, and look forward to working with Patchwork’s team and our partners to help accelerate their growth and impact for NHS staff and patients.”"
2022.8.11,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/improving-the-care-of-pregnant-women-through-ai-interview-with-sonio-ceo-cecile-brosset/,"Women’s health is still a massively under-funded and under-researched area. One major implication of this is the treatment and care available for pregnant women – impacting both the expectant mother and children. On a mission to change this, and drive a positive impact for expectant parents, Paris-based startup Sonio is pioneering the use of AI in prenatal care. Founded in 2020 by a team of entrepreneurs, scientific, medical and tech experts, Sonio leverages a holistic blend of knowledge and expertise to improve medical outcomes. The startup’s AI software provides prenatal medicine practitioners with all types of medical, imaging, genetic and environmental data to optimize prenatal screening and diagnosis – a game-changer for the sector. The solution is already being used by 150 healthcare professionals across Europe, and, this summer the team picked up €5 million in fresh funding. We wanted to find out more about Sonio, how the company came to be, what makes it so special, and what the plans are for the future. So, we had the privilege to sit down with Founder and CEO, Cécile Brosset. Sonio is building products aimed at improving care during pregnancy using artificial intelligence, which is a very important mission. Can you share more about what first prompted you to create this company? Pregnancy is one of the most beautiful moments in life. It can also become extremely stressful, even dramatic, if something goes wrong. I’ve experienced this personally being a mother of 2. Most pregnancies go well, at least in our developed economies, but access to quality care varies a lot depending on where you live, with an increasing shortage of OBGYNs and new practitioners – midwives and sonographers – coming to the game. Risk factors have also increased a lot with diabetes, obesity, age of motherhood and medically assisted procreation. Fetal ultrasound combined with genetic testing helps follow the development of the baby throughout pregnancy and detect potential malformations and diseases. But you need to be very accomplished to make sure you won’t miss an abnormality, or give the right parental counselling at the right moment. That’s why 50% of malformations go undetected before birth, and you need colleges of speciality physicians to get to the right diagnosis.   I knew that bringing technology and medical expertise together could dramatically secure prenatal care, both improving practitioner’s daily job with unique clinical inputs and productivity gains, and reassuring parents wherever they live.   So when I first met with the Polytechnique and the Necker team, crème de la crème in both AI and fetal medicine, who had been working together for 4 years on an R&D project building the first embryo of our software, I knew we were perfectly complementary and could bring something unique to this market and beneficiaries.  As for me personally, I’ve always been driven by the impact I could have in my daily job, and always regretted not having studied medicine like a whole bunch of people in my family. At Bpifrance (where I worked for 7 years), I could both experience the emergence of digital health and the incredible amount of things entrepreneurs can achieve. I had the energy to take on the challenge, I was moved by our mission so much I knew I would never doubt the why of this project, we were the right team to bring this project to life, and the economics were there. Sonio was born 😉  You currently work with around 150 healthcare professionals. What do your products do in practice and how does it help medical teams? We address two very different market segments. We first started to work with fetal medicine experts, the ones that deal with complex cases, where something is unusual with a fetus, and need to diagnose and orientate parents. Our expert software, Sonio Diagnostics, combines expert knowledge on all the anomalies and syndromes you can diagnose prenatally, and guides the physician real time during fetal ultrasound to make sure nothing is overlooked. It basically gives immediate access and intelligent prioritisation of expert medical knowledge to reach a diagnosis with more certainty, faster, and can ‘augment’ less expert physicians or at least train fellows as fast as possible. The AI we are using for this product has nothing to do with image analysis, but fundamentally is solving issues of very large dimension of data and applied probabilities. We are now working on addressing the main market, routine fetal ultrasounds being performed by midwives, sonographers or physicians. Here there are two challenges: lowering the risk of missing an abnormality while being more productive. Sonio will provide automatic recognition of ultrasound images, to make sure practitioners don’t forget to take a view and are compliant with the guidelines, to check for abnormalities, and to automatically build the reporting as they scan. It will lower medical malpractice risks, improve quality control as well as reduce the amount of time spent on administrative tasks. Our one-stop software will reinvent the sonographer’s routine, simplify the experience and secure the examination. What impact does the use of Sonio’s products have on patients? How does this differ to the standard type of care received during pregnancy? From the patient’s perspective, Sonio has several types of impact depending on the case.  If everything goes well with the pregnancy, Sonio will provide reassurance that everything has been looked at, nothing missed, and will provide a modern digital experience, by allowing the sharing of ultrasound images in one click, for example. If there is something unusual though, Sonio will act as an expert companion, a second opinion, securing both detection of the abnormality, and then diagnosis of the pathology. This could have a tremendous impact on the medical outcome both for the mother and the child. Some anomalies can be taken care of during pregnancy, through fetal surgery or hormonal treatments, or need to be dealt with during the first hours after birth, implying to give birth in a dedicated site. Focusing additional examinations, improving parental counselling and anticipating postnatal care are key aspects of Sonio’s value. Shortening time to diagnosis is key when pregnancy is 9 months long.   You recently raised a €5 million Seed round – congrats! What is your main focus as a business over the next 12 months? Do you plan to expand into new markets? We have 3 main goals for the year to come: 1/ add image recognition to our platform and get FDA-approved; 2/ expand commercially in Europe; 3/ prepare our expansion in the United States. This means investing in AI and tech developments, in clinical studies, and in marketing and sales. We are hiring new talents in those areas and structuring the company to be able to face all these challenges. Building key partnerships is also part of the plan to expand quickly and reach our full potential worldwide. It sounds like there is a lot happening at Sonio! What are you most excited about? I love seeing the team have fun working together and gather around our vision and mission. The most gratifying thing is to see our team members so proud when accomplishing great things in very little time. And obviously, see stars in the eyes of the physicians we work with when testing our software. Hopefully, soon we will also be able to see the longer-term impact on families and children. We see now that our vision is being validated by the market, we know we are building the right product, for the right cause. We know how to get there. Now we just have to make it happen! My biggest challenge (and excitement) lies in preserving our culture and values, of respect, balance, friendship, proximity, optimism, while growing fast and global, in a constrained economic environment. Being driven by our mission, women’s and children’s health, without forgetting about our own quality of life at work and at home, and making it an economic success. It’s a true endeavour, and I’m loving every step of the journey."

2022.8.12,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/prague-10-exceptionally-promising-early-stage-startups-to-watch-in-2022/,"The Czech Republic is known for its solid infrastructure, highly educated skilled workforce, and relatively low cost of living – the a great combination for startups. The Czech startup ecosystem got some momentum already back in 2010 when many new projects and accelerators started popping up. Now, the country is not only a gateway to other European hubs like Berlin and Vienna, but also has a healthy and strong presence of innovation hubs, incubators and accelerators itself. The capital city, Prague, is now a flourishing startup city. Last year there were some notable announcements, such as when online grocery startup Rohlik raised $100 million, becoming a Czech unicorn. In addition, Prague-based SaaS startup Rossum announced $100 million, one of the largest ever Series A rounds to come out of Eastern Europe. We wanted to put a spotlight on early-stage startups coming from this city, reflecting the growing startup ecosystem here and the growth of eastern European innovation. So, here are ten super exciting startups, all based in Prague, and all formed post-2019: Resistant AI Founded in 2019, Resistant AI is a startup on a mission to protect automated financial systems from manipulation and attack. Today, consumers expect financial services to be frictionless and fully digital. Automation makes this possible and makes online purchases and online finances work, however, taking humans out of the equation and prioritizing speed leaves some risks and loopholes that criminals are exploiting. Resistant AI is addressing this. The startup is helping banks, insurers and fintech’s protect against financial crime and add an extra layer of reinforcement to existing checks and monitoring systems. Using sophisticated statistical modelling and machine learning, it supports clients across the whole customer lifecycle. In 2021, the startup picked up over €14 million and is now operating internationally, with offices in Prague, London and New York. Lemonero Ecommerce is undoubtedly one of the biggest and fastest-growing markets at the moment. Lemonero is an AI-driven digital lending platform for merchants in this space – tapping into a big market. Founded in 2019, the fintech startup provides fast and flexible revenue-based financing for small and medium business owners and merchants, giving them funding from €1k to €200k with an automatic repayment process set up based on a fixed percentage of daily sales. It takes a data-driven approach to finance, empowering SMBs to grow their ecommerce activities. The startup has now raised around €14 million and is scaling fast. Digitoo The accounting world might not immediately jump out as an exciting space, but there’s plenty of interesting innovation going on making processes for accountants a little less cumbersome. Digitoo is one of these disruptive startups. Founded in 2019, Digitoo aims to free accountants of the manual and repetitive work they go through on a daily basis, in turn helping them to focus on more creative projects that have a business impact. Accounting is something every business has to do, with Digtioo it becomes something that is sleek and smooth, and much more approachable. In the accounting space, there have been huge gaps left with regard to integrating and automating workflows with innovative tech, and this is what Digitoo are now providing. The startup has now raised around €1.3 million. Choice Founded in 2020, Choice is an all-in-one solution for communication between restaurants and their guests. Restaurants have had a turbulent couple of years, suffering during the pandemic, rollercoaster lockdown policies, changes to socializing habits, and increased demands from consumers. Helping to build strong relationships between restaurants and consumers, and in turn, helping to bring restaurants more success, Choice is empowering better communications and easier interactions. The startup offers restaurants tech to develop QR payments, table ordering, digital menus, online takeaways and deliveries, table reservations and a guest CRM. Consumers expect these things from restaurants in today’s post-pandemic world, and Choice is helping restaurateurs adapt. The startup has now raised about €2.5 million. Superface Born in 2020, Superface is building the future of APIs. The startup’s low-code solution aims to replace what usually takes months of tedious work with autonomous integrations. As a result, it connects businesses almost instantaneously. Autonomous APIs, decoupled components and self-driving clients are the foundation for voice interfaces and artificial intelligence. Superface uses super interface components that enable plug-and-play usage of data and services provided by companies using their API. In 2021, the young company picked up €1.2 million and revealed its plans to become an autonomous marketplace for AI. It’s since launched new features and recorded more than 20 million executions with over 50 API Providers. Accomango Also making its way onto our list of 10 Czech startups to watch this year, tech-enabled real estate operator Accomango is building a SaaS-enabled, curated B2B marketplace between companies with manual workers and accommodation providers. Launched in 2020, the startup is disrupting an industry with digital tech that has been lagging behind in digital transformation. Accomango offers accommodation booking and people management for industrial, construction and automotive companies, alongside hostel management SaaS for accommodation providers to achieve a seamless booking process. It’s an area that’s been underserved so far, and the quality of living conditions of many of these workers is questionable at best in many situations. The team is growing fast and has now raised over €2.2 million Readmio Founded in 2019, Readmio is a mobile app that is bringing fairytales to life. Reading to children before they go to bed is a beautiful tradition that has been handed down for generations. Now, with Readmio, it has a 21st-century twist, with additional benefits for children and parents alike. As a child is read to, the app uses voice recognition technology to add fitting sounds. It has been downloaded by over 140k people and offers stories in English, Czech and Slovak. It’s helping parents and carers spend quality time with children, reading engaging stories that ultimately support mental development, foster imagination and instil humanity. Flowpay Fintech startup Flowpay was founded last year (2021) to provide small and medium-size businesses with short and medium-term financing opportunities – helping them flow a little easier. It offers a white-label API solution for Payment Service Providers (PSP), Point of Sale Systems (POS) and ecommerce platforms to help expand their financial capabilities. It gives SMEs more transparent cash flow management, helping them better understand and track customer activities and also supports the development of alternative revenues. Europe’s small and medium-sized businesses are the foundation of economic activity, but managing processes financially isn’t always easy – it can be costly. Time-consuming and requires technical knowledge. With Flowpay it’s simple and we’re impressed by their interface, tech development and fast-paced growth. Hedepy Hedepy simplifies the path to psychotherapy for everyone, through video calls. It makes psychotherapy accessible and free of prejudice. Hedepy has to date booked over 13,000 sessions and expanded to Poland, Italy and Romania last year. Founded in 2020, the company has been growing fast and is making a difference to many with its mental health services. It’s estimated that over 3 million people in the Czech Republic suffer from mental health problems, and Hedepy is on a mission to give them the support they need. With technology, Hedepy enables patients to access quality and certified experts in a convenient service that is accessible and anonymous. The startup has now raised about €1.2 million. Nelisa HRtech startup Nelisa was founded in 2021 as a recruitment platform enabling companies to find talent effectively – saving time and money. The global talent shortage is no secret and increasingly companies are finding it difficult to find the right talent, attract them, and retain them. Likewise, workers are struggling to find the right companies – often crowded out by roles with hundreds if not thousands of applicants and ineffective hiring processes. Nelisa acts as a career partner, helping applicants find a job that feels right and helping companies find the talents to help the business grow. The aim is to use tech to transform the job market for good. The team already has more than 20 members and has raised about €600k.

2022.8.16,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/sweden-based-hygglo-acquires-uk-based-fat-llama-in-e41-million-deal-to-create-worlds-biggest-peer-to-peer-rental-platform/,"Fat Llama, the community marketplace for renting almost anything, is about to be acquired by Swedish-based online rental marketplace Hygglo for about €41 million. The combined company is on its way to become the world’s biggest and most sophisticated peer-to-peer rental platform. Since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, the UK-based startup Fat Lama has gone from strength to strength with strong demand for its party-related items including cameras, speakers and DJ decks, helping it to achieve profitability last year. This success saw Fat Llama targeted by Canadian peer Ruckify for a merger and combined stock market listing last year. After the deal fell through, Fat Llama was approached by Hygglo for an acquisition. The deal will see Hygglo acquire Fat Llama’s team, operations, software and branding. Fat Llama will retain its name in the UK, US and any new markets in mainland Europe, while the startup’s co-founders Chaz Englander and Rosie Dallas will help oversee the integration as well as take seats on the new board. Fat Llama was founded in London in 2016 and has since become one of the biggest names in the growing sharing economy sector. With more than 350,000 items listed to rent, customers use the platform to rent items including campaign equipment, cameras, drones and even paddling pools. Its number one lender made over £250,000 in 2021, whilst its top 500+ lenders are regularly making over £12,000 a year in additional income. Fat Llama lenders have used the income from the platform to save for weddings, house deposits and holidays. By combining with Hygglo, the two companies will become the biggest European peer-to-peer rental platform, allowing them to serve more customers across Europe and the US. Centralising operations, technology and costs will enable the combined business to grow more efficiently and at scale by unlocking new categories and customers to help transform approaches to ownership across the world. Together, they will create a new model of ownership, enabling more people to become sustainable whilst empowering people to make money from the assets they already own. Chaz Englander, co-founder at Fat Llama, said: “We’ve built a brilliant business and team at Fat Llama and I’m so proud of everything we’ve achieved so far. I couldn’t imagine a better future for the business than this acquisition with Hygglo. We’re on exactly the same page when it comes to powering this rental revolution across Europe and the world. Founding and scaling a startup isn’t an easy thing to do but it’s an incredibly rewarding experience and this is a great moment for us to celebrate everything we’ve achieved so far. Our priority now is on smoothly integrating Fat Llama into Hygglo but Rosie and I are both entrepreneurs first and foremost and we’re excited about what the future holds for us.” Ola Degerfors, CEO at Hygglo, commented: “I’m delighted that Hygglo is acquiring Fat Llama and to combine our two amazing businesses. Chaz and Rosie have built Fat Llama into an incredible company, with advanced verification technology, great design and a loyal customer base of both renters and lenders. This is a really exciting moment for us to come together and create the world’s biggest and most sophisticated rental platform and enable people across Europe and the US to have more sustainable lifestyles through buying less and renting more.”"

The Swiss startup is using AI to connect HCPs with pharma, and in turn, bring new medicines to patients quicker. Getting new treatments and medicines to patients requires many steps in the chain. One of the critical parts is bridging a connection between the pharmaceutical companies creating the treatments, and the HCPs that can deliver them to patients. Aiming to enhance the process, Zug-based PeakData has developed an AI web-based platform that offers HCP insights for global pharmaceutical companies. The Swiss startup has now secured €12.1 million in fresh funding. Series A Funding AlbionVC led the Series A funding with Octopus Ventures and Heal Capital also participating. It follows a year of rapid growth – PeakData has reported 6x growth in 2021 and is now being used by over half of Europe’s largest pharma companies. It’s resultingly grown its employee headcount from 12-70 over the past year. The Swiss startup will use the funding to expand all aspects of the business to support its growth plans as well as continue to develop the platform. The company aims to have its platform used by the vast majority of pharmaceutical companies around the globe and in as many drug markets as possible in the next five years. AI Customer targeting platform for healthcare Launched in 2018, PeakData enables pharmaceutical companies to enhance the depth and breadth of their customer base and learn more about HCPs that are most relevant to their target market. The platform uses AI algorithms to rank these HCPs in terms of their digital impact, influence and relevance to their target market. It uses dynamic data to observe changes in HCP status over time. It means that not only can pharma companies find and personalise their communications with the top-tier experts, as the market changes, but the platform also enables them to identify emerging influencers among local treating physicians who are managing patients daily who may previously not have been on their radar. Connecting healthcare professionals with pharma for better treatments Developed by Patrick De Boer and Michael Feldman, the aim is that by utilising AI and showing more insights into HCP networks, treatments can reach patients faster. Driven by their passion to build a better future, Patrick and Michael realised that the healthcare industry was only scratching the surface when it came to the potential of AI to bring life-saving treatments to patients more quickly. The pair decided to use their data science background to improve healthcare outcomes by making sure that patients get the best treatments available, which eventually became PeakData. The team has built a platform that is capable of searching through millions of digital records to find information about HCPs and map their professional interests as well as their connections to peers. What sets PeakData apart is the scope of this mapping, with up to 90% of HCPs in any therapeutic area covered, giving pharma companies much greater insight into all levels of healthcare provision. Patrick De Boer, co-founder of PeakData explained: “We started PeakData after a dawning realisation that AI could help provide better patient outcomes. In order to ensure healthcare professionals are aware of the latest medicines, pharmaceutical companies must be provided with the latest data about them and their key focus areas. We see PeakData as filling a key gap in the way our customers receive and analyse this data in order to improve the conversations they are having with a much wider variety of HCPs in their area. Combining our AI approach and platform with the global presence of a number of pharmaceutical companies will have an immediate and long-term positive impact for our customers and the patients they serve. We’re delighted that Albion shares this vision and look forward to working with them in the future.” In addition, new and emerging influencers are also much more easily uncovered with PeakData, as the platform gives users constant insights on digital activators – a practising HCP who has a robust and established digital presence and actively shapes clinical opinion. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, it is critical for pharmaceutical companies to find and engage digital activators, so they can reach more healthcare professionals, earlier and quicker, and steepen the product adoption curve. It’s also a product that is fully customisable to the needs of each of its customers. Customers interact with PeakData through a web-based platform that learns about their distinct needs and attempts to provide the most interesting insights depending on territory, drug market and background. While it is possible to search PeakData’s entire database, the platform has been designed to show customers exactly what they are looking for to ensure that people get a view of the things that they care about the most, based on where they are and what they do. Christoph Ruedig, partner at AlbionVC said: “When we first met Patrick, Michael and the team, we were impressed by their dedication, drive and determination to develop the best data AI platform in a healthcare setting. Finding the right therapeutic experts and healthcare professionals for their medicines is massively important for pharmaceutical companies and with PeakData they can now reach global, national, and local medical professionals who shape clinical decision-making. The potential for PeakData to help provide better patient outcomes and improve the decision-making of key healthcare professionals is very exciting and we’re pleased to be able to join the team on this journey.”"
2022.8.22,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/super-important-pr-tactics-that-b2b-startups-need-to-know/,"A good PR strategy can increase the brand awareness and credibility of your startup. However, if you are a B2B startup and new to the world of PR, you might quickly realize that there are big differences in how B2B startups get press. As a B2B startup, you will need to focus more on industry publications and other places where key business decision-makers are spending their time. For example, if you are selling cloud storage software to legal firms, then you will need to find those publications that IT managers in that industry are reading. There are many tried and tested tactics to get press as a B2B startup. Here are a few to help you get started: Focus on thought leadership There will be times when you won’t have anything “newsworthy” to share. Positioning yourself as a thought leader can be a great way to get and keep your startup in the media. A consistent presence in the right trade or industry publications – whether by writing guest posts or just offering quotes – is one of the best ways to position yourself as a thought leader. Keep in mind that if you are writing an opinion piece or guest post, you’ll need a bit of patience after submitting it to an editor. Larger publications have very strict editorial guidelines and lengthy article queues. Therefore, it may be weeks before you hear back from them. On the other hand, smaller, industry-specific trade publications are more likely to accept one-off articles from outside contributors. Typically, they have smaller teams of in-house writers and are more open to sharing advice or opinions from industry experts. Even if they have a smaller audience, writing for trade publications can still pay off big for your startup. It’s an opportunity for you to speak directly to your target audience. You can go more in-depth, sharing your expertise about specific industry trends. You can also get into more technical details because readers will already understand your industry. Go beyond the traditional media There are so many ways people find and consume content these days – from articles on social media and podcasts to email newsletters and videos. Instead of focusing all of your efforts on pitching ‘traditional’ media outlets, think about where else your target audience is spending their time. For example, a podcast interview or mention in an email newsletter with thousands of followers in your industry could result in much more attention for your startup than a mention on a general tech news site that publishes dozens of news articles each day. Share more than press releases Content such as studies, whitepapers, and ebooks with fresh insights or data about your industry don’t have to live only on your website. They can also be valuable assets for PR. You can offer this new content to industry publications in advance of publishing on your company website, along with a short pitch (a few sentences) on why you think this topic is so relevant for your industry right now. Make sure to include a direct link to the content (ex: PDF) rather than directing them to a landing page where they need to complete a form to view it. If a journalist finds it useful, they may share it or use it as a source in a relevant story, with a nice mention of your company. This is a great way to showcase your expertise and continuously build credibility during slower periods. Always provide value You don’t need to be a PR pro to secure ongoing media coverage for your B2B startup. By focusing your pitching efforts on media outlets important to your industry, you can increase your chances of securing coverage and getting in front of a relevant audience. Just make sure your pitch communicates that you’ve done your research: you understand the publication’s audience, what that journalist typically writes about, and that you are genuinely trying to provide something of value to their readers."

2022.8.22,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/vilnius-based-okredo-scores-e650k-for-its-open-data-platform/,"Lithuanian startup Okredo has announced a raise of €650k in a follow-up funding round. The SaaS startup is enabling small European businesses to access enhanced business opportunities. Data – and more importantly access to it – is one of the forces that is keeping European society and economy ticking. We live in a data-driven world, and it’s now something that needs to be leveraged by businesses across verticals. For SMEs though – this isn’t necessarily a simple task. Aiming to help companies access data with improved insights, Okredo has just picked up €650k, despite a slowdown in VC investment. The Funding The fresh funding for the Vilnius-based startup was led by the Lithuanian Business Angels Fund, Presto Ventures, and Lighthouse Ventures. The €650k boost can be seen as a continuation of its 2021 round – when the team secured €1 million. The raised funds will be used to expand into the UK and other markets, and the development of an Open Banking solution. Open data platform for optimised business Founded in 2015, Okredo has swiftly become a trusted SaaS platform that is enabling SMEs to assess the credibility, stability, and sales potential of prospective and ongoing business partners and clients. It’s a startup tackling a far-reaching issue – access to actionable data. It’s an issue that SMEs are increasingly experiencing as most countries’ data is fragmented across several sources, requires numerous integrations, takes a long time to acquire, and is challenging to comprehend. Why does it matter though? This data could be utilized for both sales and credit risk management – imperative in business processes. Consequently, there is a need in the market for a product that allows data to be easily understood and aid businesses in resolving these issues — and Okredo plans to offer such practical solutions. Growing data industry The rise of the data-driven world has also been fuelled by directives like the 2019 EU Directive on Open Data and the Re-use of Public Sector Information, which urges EU countries to make publicly financed and public sector data as accessible as possible to enable information re-use, which can result in financial gains. This data market development especially impacts SMEs, which are often exposed to greater risks as they have insufficient knowledge and resources to collect and interpret data, and no funds for expensive credit risk management solutions such as credit bureaus or credit insurance. Gerda Jurkonienė, co-founder and CEO of Okredo: ”The decision of some venture capital funds to continue investments is a sign of the company’s efficiency and ability to deliver results. The general proliferation of the data market — with its ability to increase the overall speed of business — has also helped attract further investments. The data industry, which has even been dubbed by some as the ‘new oil’, is an attractive field for investors.” Gerda added: “Our platform offers a variety of tools that make it simpler to assess businesses’ risks and sales potential. These tools are highly valuable due to the current economic instability, brittle logistical chains, the ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the reorientation of international commerce. However, European companies currently lack a widely-accessible open data platform to analyze such factors, which is exactly what we want to change. To help tackle this situation, we have also created a number of API solutions for our partners who create ERP, CRM, and accounting systems, adding the value of current data to their services.” Supporting European SMEs The Lithuanian startup has already launched successfully across the Baltics, and now, with this new funding has plans to expand across Europe. The platform was introduced in all three Baltic nations last year and currently has over 17,000 users and more than 3,000 corporate clients. In addition to the planned expansion to the UK and other markets, Okredo is developing an open banking solution for its users. More specifically, the company wants to tackle the critical element in a company’s risk assessment — the financial status based on annual reports that become obsolete even before the official declaration. The solution, with the company’s consent, will categorize cash flow and other financial parameters and enable the sharing of its financial performance with relevant stakeholders throughout the year. Businesses will be able to make financial decisions quicker by engaging business partners, investors, or lending institutions with access to up-to-date data. Even if the financial performance is weakened, the company will be able to address issues sooner, initiate credit amendment actions, etc. In turn, up-to-date data would provide a more thorough basis for business assessment, allowing to improve the structure of internal operations and accelerate business processes. Roman Nováček, partner at Presto Ventures: “Having invested in Okredo a few months ago, we had the opportunity to observe the company’s operations from the inside, to get to know the processes and the team. Our investment has exceeded our expectations and we still see potential in further developing their product and adding new features to broaden the market potential. We want to play a more active role in Okredo’s expansion to other countries. We have no doubt that a single European platform for corporate data can make doing business across Europe more secure, especially for small businesses that were traditionally priced out of the market. They will definitely appreciate it in these uncertain economic conditions”"
2022.8.23,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/london-based-wombat-scores-over-e4-5-million-for-its-micro-investing-platform/,"Fintech startup Wombat has picked up a fresh capital boost of over €4.5 million. The London-based company is enabling a new generation of investors with its innovative platform. The investment world is continuing to see interesting innovation and development. One of the big stand-out trends in this space is micro-investment – a way of enabling newcomers to the investment space to get started with minimal capital commitment. On a mission to break down barriers in the investment space, Wombat has just secured new funding and is planning its next steps. The funding The Series A funding round of over €4.5 million was led by Fuel Ventures, which previously backed Wombat – leading a previous round of about €2.3 million. Additional finances come from a four-week crowdfunding campaign. Micro-investing on the go Founded by Kane Harrison in 2017, the London-based fintech offers a mobile-first fractional micro-investment platform that gives everyone the chance to get involved in investing. Users can select from a range of themed funds and individual shares to create a personalised portfolio that reflects their interests. They can begin investing in some of the world’s biggest brands for just €10. The aim is to break down the barriers to investing and empower a new generation with the tools and knowledge they need to make wise financial choices. Wombat co-founder and CEO, Kane Harrison: “Wombat has come a long way in the last three years and closing this funding round is another key milestone on our journey to help more budding investors embrace the habit of saving and investing for their futures.” Rapid growth Recognised as the fastest growing investment app in 2021, this new funding is a positive sign of health for Wombat – especially considering the wider context of economic pessimism at the moment. The company has also just launched a number of new projects, including its instant investment account which offers commission-free trading and cashback rewards. It also follows the appointment of some well-known figures to the advisory board – including David Davies, former CIO at Hargreaves Lansdown, Iqbal Gandham, former MD at eToro and Chad West, ex-Revolut communications director. Moving forward, the London-based startup plan to expand internationally – beginning with Europe. It is estimated to have a total addressable market of 100 million users and plans to increase its investment in marketing and product development. Kane Harrison, CEO and co-founder of Wombat said: “Against a hugely challenging macroeconomic backdrop, we felt it was appropriate to seek funding with a fair valuation and we feel our decision was rewarded with a raise that will help us achieve our immediate goals in terms of growth, expansion into Europe and product development. The funding will help us deliver on our plans to encourage millions of people to invest and safeguard their futures while offering them a range of engaging and compelling ways to do so.”"
2022.8.23,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/sofia-based-nploy-swipes-e2-million-for-its-job-matching-platform/,"Making talent-hiring and job-searching simpler, nPloy has just secured €2 million of fresh funding. The Sofia-based startup has developed an online platform that works like a dating app for job seekers and recruitment teams. Job searching can be an exhausting process. From trawling through all the different job search websites to tackling each individual hiring procedure, and not to mention the interviews and all the CV updates and rewrites along the way – it’s not something that naturally fits into most people’s lifestyles. At the same time, for recruitment teams facing the ever-growing talent gap, there’s certainly some mismatch in the recruitment space at the moment. Aiming to streamline the process and adapt it for the realities of modern life, nPloy has developed a new recruitment platform. The startup has just secured €2 million. The funding This €2 million raise marks the first investment for the Sofia-based startup. It was led by the local VC firm Morningside Hill setting the goal of expanding the platform to Central and East European countries. Matching jobs and people There are plenty of recruitment platforms out there – so what stops nPloy from becoming just another one of those sites? Founded in 2018, nPloy directly matches and connects candidates and employers based on the dating apps model. Its algorithm matches talent with companies based on mutual expectations and requirements. Hiring teams get access to a diverse database and a modern approach to finding talents. Meanwhile, candidates enjoy features that make finding the right job simpler. It also has a feature that means people don’t have to actively search for a job – companies can apply to people in a switch-up of the traditional model. The app’s smart algorithm shows the candidates only job ads that meet all their requirements, including salary. It also lets users know whether their application has been reviewed, approved or not – addressing a common frustration with job seekers. As with dating apps, if there is a mutual feeling of interest between the company and candidate, a chat automatically opens between the two parties and a video interview can be scheduled. The latest version of the mobile app also offers the possibility for candidates to follow tailored news, join clubs with like-minded people and various types of career-related online events. nPloy Co-Founder Konstantin Tsonev, explained: “Mass online job posting platforms, not only on the Balkans, but also in Europe, are often clumsy and inefficient. This is exactly what we want to change with nPloy, having successfully built an innovative job-matching platform based on the dating apps models. We’ve replaced the standard pre-screening process with an AI algorithm allowing users to see only vacancies relevant to their experience and requirements, and employers to source the right candidates more efficiently.” Scaling up Currently, the Bulgarian startup counts over 85k users and over 500 employers including BIC, SAP, Lidl, Postbank and others, thanks to its transparent and efficient selection process. Pavel Velkov, managing partner in the VC firm Morningside Hill, said: “We invested in nPloy because we believe in the urgent need of transforming the recruitment market in Europe. Every good idea needs a great business plan and people who are passionate about its implementation, and nPloy has exactly that.” Now, with this new funding, the team want to expand to new markets in Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is that by the end of 2023, the platform will be active in about 10 more countries. Maria Petrova, director of business development in nPloy, added: “nPloy’s goal is to make things easier. Job finding doesn’t have to be such a complicated and slow process when there are modern technologies to solve these problems. In a market with low unemployment rates and growth in job openings, candidates don’t want to waste time in a couple of interviews just to find out that their financial expectations don’t even meet, for example. Any difficulty, delay and inefficient processes turn down a large number of applicants. This is where nPloy comes in – you create a quick profile and you can immediately apply or wait for an employer to send you a match request for a suitable position.”"
2022.8.23,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/berlin-based-promiseq-scores-new-funding-to-fight-false-alarms-in-the-security-sector/,"Using AI to improve operational efficiencies for security firms, promiseQ has just secured a six-figure investment round. The Berlin-based startup has now onboarded its first clients and is ramping up expansion plans. It’s reported that CCTV numbers worldwide reached the mark of one billion devices last year. There have been big advancements in CCTV tech in recent years, facilitating the rapid rate at which they are being used, and ensuring that they are used properly – to make people safer. However, it’s simultaneously reported that billions in taxpayer money and company revenue are being wasted due to operational inefficiencies – namely, false alerts emitted by the devices. For example, research by Arizona State University Center for Problem-Oriented Policing found that between 94-98% of alarm call-outs are false. Founded in 2021, promiseQ wants to change this – and the team has just raised new funding to do so. The funding PromiseQ has announced a six-figure pre-seed investment round to scale its tech. The round, whilst not disclosed, is reported to be a high six-figure sum and was led by APX and security industry experts. PromiseQ is a portfolio company of APX and has also received the backing of angel investors such as René Helbig, former CTO of Securitas Germany and owner of WSD Permanent Security GmbH. Elias Kardel, Co-Founder & CTO of promiseQ: “False alarms desensitise safety systems, waste resources, and dilute human reactions to real-life security threats. We’re in the business of changing that. promiseQ’s customers can boost their ability to manage threats effectively while cutting costs related to false alarms. Threat Detect is scalable to video surveillance systems worldwide. We believe our product can positively influence the security industry as whole in the coming years. As a next step, we will continue to closely focus on the needs of our customers and will further develop our software platform to manage all camera-related monitoring centre tasks.” Threat Detect The Berlin-based startup’s flagship product is Threat Detect – a hybrid AI system which eradicates false alarms that clog up security networks and stifle emergency response. The digital system allows users total CCTV alarm oversight online without the reliance on labour-intensive and costly monitoring centres. Further, the false alarm filter has the advantage of being able to call on external global analysts ready to verify alarms in unprecedented situations. In its pilot projects, promiseQ has achieved a 95% success rate in determining false alarms from genuine threats. It’s now being used within the security industry with the first clients already onboarded – International Security Group and WSD Permanent Security are among clients. Founders Elias Kardel and Tolga Ermis are now bringing the startup into an expansion phase. Capping off a great first half of 2022, promiseQ was recently invited to SXSW in Austin, Texas, and VivaTech in Paris, France, to showcase Threat Detect as part of a German startup delegation. Tolga Ermis, Co-Founder & CEO of promiseQ: “False alarms are one of the main problems facing emergency responders, law enforcement, security personnel and others tasked with protecting property and keeping people safe. False alarms are also a massive drain on finances for businesses. With promise Q, we are providing an innovative solution to this and as a result are reducing client security costs by up 1 / 2 to 80%. Threat Detect is an ally to video surveillance operators around the world. We are now planning to raise a seed funding round to expand promiseQ’s services throughout Germany and beyond.”"

The funding will fuel expansion plans. Making businesses more sustainable and lightening the environmental and societal impact of corporate action is a key priority across the world at the moment. Governments, organisations and societal actors are all pushing for businesses to embed ESG objectives within corporate strategy in order to create a healthier society for the long term. But, how can corporates be sure they are taking the right steps towards sustainability? That’s where ESG data comes in – data that can give insights into a business’s environmental, societal and economic impact and in turn, give actionable insights into how to improve the situation. Worldfavor is a platform on a mission to help businesses transition to a more sustainable way of operating and has just picked up fresh funding. The funding The Stockholm-based company has today announced a Series A funding round of €10.2 million. It comes off the back of a €2.8 million raise in 2018 – showing plenty of growth for the startup over the past couple of years as sustainability has come to a central focus. The round was led by SEB Private Equity alongside existing investors Brightly Ventures and Spintop Ventures. Making a difference is possible Founded in 2016, Worldfavor was developed by four friends from their flat in Stockholm – all with their eyes set on giving businesses the tools they need to transition to a more sustainable way of operating. The platform shows that doing business can go hand in hand with caring about the people, planet and economy and reducing the footprint of the worldwide business community. Worldfavor enables businesses worldwide to easily access, share, and leverage business ESG data – such as GHG emissions, diversity, human rights, anti-corruption and more – to gain insights and make sustainable action possible, both internally and through far-reaching value chains, as well as those of investments. It makes sustainable action possible by centralising high-quality, impactful, ESG data all in one platform – connecting businesses worldwide and making combined action a reality. Worldfavor supports adherence to legislation and staying compliant with laws and ESG-related regulations and frameworks such as the SFDR, HRDD, GHG, GRI and more. Andreas Liljendahl, Worldfavor co-founder and CEO, said: “Worldfavor was founded in 2016 and since then we have found ourselves scaling rapidly. We now work with over 25,000 organisations in 130+ countries, enabling better decision-making, and increasing ESG awareness across global operations. With new funding and strategic partners, we’re now accelerating towards Worldfavor’s mission to make sustainable business the mainstream.” Scaling up With the vision that every person and business can make a difference by being able to make truly sustainable decisions, Worldfavor has already been making a change across Europe. Since its launch, the startup has enhanced considerable growth and seen year-on-year surges in user uptake. It currently supports clients across industries, from food to finance, and of all sizes – from SMEs to Fortune 500 companies. Prominent clients of the 25k+ network include Nudie Jeans (frontrunner in sustainable denim production), IK Partners (European private equity advisory group with Nordic roots, operating across Northern Europe), Systembolaget (the Swedish monopoly for alcohol), Oatly (Swedish food company that produces alternatives to dairy products from oats, Oakley Capital (private equity investor) and Grant Thornton (one of the world’s largest accounting and consulting firms). Worldfavor will use the funding to continue its ambitious expansion and market entry plans to fill the global gap of easily accessing, sharing and gaining insights from ESG data to fuel sustainable action. At the same time, Worldfavor will invest in research and development to continually improve the platform, support businesses in all stages of their sustainability journey, and provide users with the best possible product. Babak Etemad, Investment Director at SEB Private Equity, added: “We’re happy to join the impressive team at Worldfavor in their pursuit of raising the bar on sustainability and help organisations share critical sustainability-related information. We are confident that Worldfavor will play a vital role in this industry over the coming decade, and we look forward to supporting them on the journey.”"

The startup gives a realistic picture of the cost of sustainable renovations, making house hunting more transparent. House hunting comes with a lot of things to think about – one of the biggest obstacles to overcome is of course the cost. And this cost only escalates when renovations come into play. Often, many house hunters fall in love with a dream home only to find the cost of the renovations to be a massive blow. Setle, a Belgian-based startup, lets users know almost instantly what it costs to renovate a home – giving estate agents more reliable and credible information that they can share with prospective buyers. Thibaut Nivelles, CEO of Setle: “As the saying goes, “every Belgian is born with a brick in their stomach”. The family home is still the biggest household expense each month. The sharp rise in energy prices and the growing importance of a sustainable energy transition don’t always make it easy for those looking to build or buy their own home to see the wood for the trees. At Setle, our aim is to help people who are buying or renovating their home to make the right decisions in the renovation process.” The funding The proptech startup has just announced a raise of €1.5 million for its platform. The investment was led by KBC and marks a new partnership between the bank and the startup. Thibaut Nivelles: “We are delighted that KBC, which boasts the best mobile banking app in the world and has a clear focus on sustainability, will be supporting us in the further development of our business.” Renovation transparency Founded in 2020, Setle’s online platform gives a realistic picture of the cost of (sustainable) renovations on top of the purchase price – giving users comprehensive support before they make a massive financial commitment. With a clear breakdown of costs and a user-friendly interface, the tool makes searching for the ideal home more efficient and transparent for both estate agents and potential buyers. Using Setle’s real-time digital solution, estate agents who pay an annual license fee can give individuals (buyers and renovators) a real-time insight into the total cost of the property they have in mind, including estimates of renovation costs, costs of making the property more sustainable, improving the energy label rating and energy consumption, obtaining potential subsidies and grants, and benchmarking quotes from contractors. This detailed renovation report, which includes a very detailed set of specifications, allows estate agents to take a good deal of worry from their clients’ shoulders. Estate agents can also suggest alternative properties which, based on Setle’s renovation estimate (including subsidies and grants), might be a more interesting proposition for the prospective buyer as an overall investment. The report is accepted by KBC Bank as well as other banks, as part of the loan application process. For prospective builders and renovators, there are benefits as well. They can view the going rates for all applicable renovation works and can easily calculate the cost of renovating the property they have in mind. This also means they have a good benchmark against which to check the rates charged by their contractor. Karin Van Hoecke, Innovation Manager at KBC Group’s Belgium Business Unit: “The transition to sustainable energy will have a fundamental impact on the whole of society. For private individuals, the main focus of the transition is their home. They sometimes don’t know where to start and above all have lots of questions when it comes to buying a home, carrying out renovations, improving the insulation or keeping energy bills affordable.” Building up the platform Based in Limburg, Setle is currently used by more than 425 estate agents and counts around 10 team members. This new funding will be used to expand the platform, and give KBC Bank customers a worry-free approach to sustainable renovation. Setle and KBC will also be starting a number of pilot projects in the autumn. Karin Van Hoecke added: “As a bank-insurer, financing and insuring people’s homes is a core task for KBC. In recent years, however, we have also enabled our customers to enjoy the benefits that come from our partnerships with third parties that go beyond purely financial services. Examples include group buying schemes (through our Deals service) or the ability to compare energy prices (via ‘Mijnenergie.be’ in KBC Press Release Page 2 of 3 Mobile). The investment in Setle is the next step in ensuring maximum convenience for our customers when they renovate their homes and make them more energy-efficient. We see that customers are looking for solutions that make their lives easier, and we recognise Setle’s potential in this regard. We believe in Setle’s strong team and excellent solutions that seamlessly meet our customers’ challenges and contribute to a total solution and experience for them.”"

The Berlin-based team is aiming to blend digital financial advice, banking and investing with sustainability for ethical millennials. Making sustainable and ethical financial choices is something that young generations are increasingly interested in. The impact generation of millennials and GenZ are reported to be more aware of the environmental, societal and economic impacts of their actions, and, growing up in a world that is chasing sustainability and salvation for the planet has left a lasting impact. Millennials, equipped with consciousness and awareness of the importance of sustainable and ethical thinking, are now entering a phase of life where they have more financial power. And it’s been reported that millennials will soon be the wealthiest generation in human history as they begin to inherit and look to invest. Getting involved in investing isn’t easy though – and millennials are also seen to be open to investing, but hesitant to actually do it. Enter SageWealth – aims to help millennials get into the investment space, and put their inheritance to use – in a way that benefits the millennial as much as society. SageWealth: Fintech for good Founded in Berlin in 2020, SageWealth is bringing digital financial advice & sustainable investing to ambitious and ethical millennials. The aim is to get this generation to invest in their financial future in a way that leaves positive impacts. Founders Sana Al-Badri and Marco Vega Seeberger met at university where they both were finishing their degrees in neuroscience and psychology. As activists, a positive impact on the world was their life’s north star early on. But as researchers, measurable data mattered most to both. They discovered that sustainable investing is 27x more impactful than changes in behaviours.In a society where we are constantly reminded of our individual power to make change for good, coupled with the knowledge that younger generations are about to take on the investment space – this opens up vast possibilities. Taking this on board, the founders became financial advisors with the vision to change the investment world for ambitious & conscious young investors. “Basically financial advisory has not changed since the 70s. Our generation distrusts banks because they simply don’t understand our values and needs” , said Sana Al-Badri, Founder of SageWealth. Growth and funding The Berlin-based startup has now announced a raise of €500k to build out its digital platform. They’ve done so with a diverse cap table with 40% of Angels being female. Influential investors, such as Dr. Marta Ra, founder of Women in Sustainable Finance, and Marie Louise Seelig, founder of CrossLend, have joined. Backers include Till, founder of Nebenan.de, Hans, founder of Clue, and Aleks, founder of Penta. It comes after reporting 20% month-on-month growth after launch last year with €1 million in assets under control. Until this funding, the startup was bootstrapped and had no marketing budget – so it’s clear to see they are onto something.The funding will be used to build further financial life planning tools and offer investments with the strongest sustainability criteria for ETFs. In order to scale, they have now hired industry veterans, including ex-Trade Republic, ex-Getquin, ex-Join Capital and ex-Northvolt."

With a target capitalization of €100 million, the firm will support early-stage funding for CEE-based tech companies. The Central and Eastern Europe region has been making its presence felt in the startup community. Home to some of Europe’s most exciting startup hubs it’s proved fertile ground for nurturing successful innovation and European unicorns. Now, the region has another fund supporting early-stage funding. Inovo VC – a Polish firm – has announced its third fund to back tech innovation in the region, looking for those entrepreneurs and teams with global potential. “We are looking for companies conquering global markets that can grow to USD 100 million in revenue in just a few years. We have managed to become a fund of choice for Polish founders and we want to replicate that in the other CEE countries, as we already see we can be as helpful to those founders as we are to the ones from Poland” explained Michał Rokosz, Partner at Inovo VC.  The financials With a target capitalization of €100 million, this is a fund that will leave its mark in the region. Already, over 50% of capital has been committed with private investors accounting for over half of its total AUM so far. There are additional institutional investors expected to commit by the end of the year. The firm is set to invest in a total of 20-30 companies, with a single investment ticket running from €500 right up to €4 million. It’ll focus from pre-seed to Series B rounds – so there’s plenty of scope and variation coming from this fund. “Over the last 7 years we’ve seen the region growing at an exceptional pace, which results in the rise of the number of funding rounds and in an even faster rise of startup valuations at every stage of their development. We are sure that the CEE region will raise at least ten new unicorns in the upcoming 5 years. With our new fund we want to help make that happen”.Tomasz Swieboda, partner at Inovo VC. Nurturing up-and-coming innovation This is Inovo’s third fund – the first Polish firm to reach this milestone. The aim is to identify and nurture outstanding founders of tech companies from the CEE region and boost international potential. About 60% of the capital will go to Polish tech startups and the remaining funds will go to companies from the rest of the region which includes Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Inovo, which is led by Tomasz Swieboda, Michał Rokosz and Maciej Małysz has already set a strong track record with its two previous funds backing over 30 companies – of which, 6 already have a valuation of over €100 million. The current portfolio of Inovo VC includes: AllSet –a pick-up or dine-in food marketplace operating in the US market, Archbee – a developers’ collaboration tool, Booksy – a SaaS-enabled marketplace for beauty services, Infermedica – an AI-powered technology for preliminary medical diagnosis and triage, Packhelp – a custom-made packaging producer, Preply – a global language learning marketplace, connecting tutors with students, Spacelift – a Terraform-compatible CI/CD platform for infra-as-code, Tidio – live chat, chatbot and mailing solutions for micro-businesses, and Zowie – a self-learning AI chatbot automating customer service for enterprise clients. “Inovo was the first investor of Booksy and has been actively supporting us since then. Michał Rokosz even joined us as an interim COO for almost two years, helping the company grow its revenue sixfold and raise over USD 15 million from international venture capital firms. They have remained with us today and I still can call them for help even in the most extraordinary cases. Inovo is effectively a Swiss Army knife of VCs.”Stefan Batory, Co-Founder and CEO of Booksy. Promoting Poland and CEE Through its capital investments and the active support of founders and their teams in growing startups and paving the way for later-stage funding from international investors, Inovo VC plays a significant role in the development of the Polish startup ecosystem. Polish VC investments grew 22.6x from 2018 to 2021, reaching a total value of €792 million last year. Further, the total value of VC investments in the first six months of 2022 in Poland reached €448 million – which is quite an impressive figure. We took a look at the promising Polish startups to watch this year back in February, and the country has certainly kept our attention as the year has gone on. Inovo is committing itself to the wider CEE region as well – home to the always-exciting Baltic region as well as up-and-coming nations such as Romania, this fund is sure to have a prominent role to play in the years ahead. “We see an increasing interest of international investors in companies founded in the CEE countries. Two third of our portfolio companies managed to raise follow-on rounds with top-tier international VCs. We want to strengthen the links between the CEE region and the global VC ecosystem even more. So far, we have co-invested with over 70 international funds and we are convinced this number will grow at a fast pace” said Maciej Małysz, Partner at Inovo VC. We might be seeing some economic pessimism at the moment, but funds that support grassroots and early-stage innovation and entrepreneurship is one way that Europe’s wider business community can remain optimistic and keep striving for the future. Interested in the CEE region? We have taken a look at several exciting startups from this part of Europe recently, including Romania, the Czech Republic (and Prague), Estonia and more."
2022.8.24,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/the-weroad-journey-connecting-people-culture-and-stories-interview-with-erika-de-santi/,"The travel industry has been on a rollercoaster ride over the past couple of years. From dealing with a complete shutdown to one of the busiest summers’s on record and a talent shortage – travel providers have had to adapt, strategise and overcome. But with a challenge, comes opportunity. And the travel tech sector has also been one of the most exciting areas of innovation in the past couple of years, and we’ve seen travel tech startups become unicorns and globally reaching companies. There’s been exciting innovation and inspiring creativity taking travel to a new generation. Founded in 2017, WeRoad is a Milan-based startup specialising in group adventure travel for millennials. It’s providing a service tailored to a generation that is often finding themselves travelling solo – but looking for hyper-connected, personalised and fun experiences. The Italian startup is one of Europe’s fastest-growing travel operators, with offices in Italy, Spain and the UK and plans to enter Germany, France, Benelux and the Nordics next year. This year the company hit €30 million in revenue and is experiencing 3.5x growth vs 2019 levels. WeRoad is building the largest travel community in Europe – it has 30,000+ customers and 1.5 million social media followers, making it the world’s #1 adventure travel social brand. So, we just had to sit down with co-founder Erika De Santi to find out more. What is the vision behind WeRoad? WeRoad’s vision is crystal clear: connecting people, cultures and stories. Our mission is to design and deliver experiences worth living and sharing, rewriting the rules of the travel industry, every f*cking step of the way. And that’s exactly what we’ve been doing. In 5 years we’ve taken 30k+ customers (WeRoaders) all over the world. We got through the pandemic safe and sound, constantly seeking out destinations that were open and safe to travel to. Our tours are designed to be life-changing: we push people out of their comfort zones and help them discover faraway lands, but also enable them to connect with fellow travellers and make friends. We ensure every itinerary has the right blend of elements to help foster meaningful relationships and create life-changing experiences. A tour doesn’t last forever, but a friendship does, especially one built on incredible shared moments. Social media and community building sit at the heart of our business and it’s an approach which has made us one of the fastest growing travel operators in Europe with offices in Italy, Spain and the UK, and plans to launch in France, Germany, Benelux and the Nordics by next year. What inspired you to launch WeRoad? The inspiration for WeRoad was born out of my and my co-founders’ needs as millennial travellers. Your late 20s, 30s and early 40s is a time we hit a number of milestones – be it new relationships, jobs, kids, marriage, new house – as such it’s increasingly challenging to organise trips with friends all on different paths. It’s also harder to meet new people and with 64% of millennials not in a stable relationship, there is growing demand for group travel solutions from millennials wanting to travel the world but wanting to share the experience with others. This was a situation myself and my co-founders found ourselves in. We had separately gone on group tours for solo travellers and were equally disappointed. We felt the “new connections” element of the experience was severely lacking and not treated as a core component. After testing out alternative offerings it was obvious the tours weren’t designed with this focus in mind and was something we felt desperately needed to change. We decided to build a travel community and tour operator designing and delivering incredible life-changing and off the beaten track experiences to appeal to millennials.  We wanted to offer genuine opportunities to create life-long friendships while making it easier for people to travel solo by grouping like-minded individuals. What makes WeRoad stand out as a travel provider? Our business model is drastically different to that of our peers. Although we operate in the travel sector we don’t see ourselves as “a travel brand” but rather a Direct-to-consumer business relying on 3 pillars. WeRoad is simultaneously a tour operator, a community business and a travel tech company:  Tour operator. We design tours and directly negotiate and operate tour services, thus making it easier for us to control product quality, while ensuring it aligns with our vision. Community. We have 1K+ travel coordinators across 3 countries, 30k+ WeRoaders and 1.5 million social media followers. Our expertise is about creating and fueling communities of people and ambassadors both online and in the physical world Travel tech. We develop all our technology and digital platforms in-house to enable travel operations at scale and also to provide an extraordinary customer experience allowing direct booking without OTAs or other intermediaries  We’ve built and developed a strong brand identity with a very distinctive approach to marketing and communication thanks to a tone of voice which is friendly, quick-witted, always ironic and a little cheeky. WeRoad is supported by a network of so-called ‘WeRoaders’. Tell us about the community approach – what benefits does this have for business? And what about for the users/customer experience? Our community of WeRoaders is fundamental for our business for several reasons. First and foremost: retention. People travelling with us develop a strong sense of belonging and in the majority of cases are having their first intercontinental experience. Our WeRoaders community then becomes a huge bank of intel and advice which everyone can benefit from. It was a huge compliment when WeRoaders started using the phrase “let’s do a WeRoad,” as a way of travelling and exploring the world. Secondly, for engagement and amplification of our vision of connecting people, culture and stories. Millennials typically travel two to three times a year but thanks to the spontaneously organised events among our community, the strength of our online interactions and stories shared across our channels, people get to continuously live and breathe our brand. Thirdly, talent scouting. Our community plays a significant role with recruitment and we receive frequent applications for the coordinator post from WeRoaders. It’s a coveted position for which we receive some 4000+ applications each year. Can you tell us about the ‘coordinators’ you have leading tours? When we think of our ‘favourite’ trips, sure we think of some kick-ass destinations, but in all honesty, they’re not our favourites because the scenery was awesome, but rather because of the connections made or nurtured. That’s where the travel coordinator comes in. Our coordinators provide a WeRoad live presence during the trips. They manage the itinerary, logistics and relationships with local partners and crucially, they’re trained to manage the group dynamics. They help people get to know each other, boost moods during long transfers, they manage the flexible component of our trips tailoring the last mile of the experience and adapting it to fit with the group’s interests. They also create some incredible spontaneous moments which really make the trips. They help WeRoaders get out of their comfort zone and live the whole experience with them. What’s really powerful is having travel coordinators who have never visited the destination leading the tour. This way they can enjoy and put so much of their own personality into the trip making it truly unique. Do you see differences in how different generations travel – and how does WeRoad address this? Millennials are hyper-connected and time-poor, but at the same time, they want to co-create and have control over their travel experiences. This means their exploration of the world is different to that of older generations. Millennials are motivated by the love of long-haul travel, the desire for adventure, the chance to create life-long friendships and to have authentic, life-changing experiences. Millennials are also the “bucket list” and FOMO generation and off-the-beaten-track experiences and must-see/do activities resonate. Conventional holidays have lost traction with this cohort who don’t want to be treated as consumers of a product but as participants in a community of like-minded people, and we’ve embedded these aspects into the DNA of our travel experiences. WeRoad was born in Milan and has expanded across Europe. What has been your expansion strategy? As mentioned earlier, social and community building sit at the heart of our business and these elements are key to our growth and expansion. Our growth strategy relies on the localisation of our communities with WeRoaders and coordinators playing a crucial role here. We maximise our digital platforms to engage with our target audience and facilitate our growth as a global engine catering to the variety of local market needs. Our ambition is to become the leading adventure travel brand in Europe by 2025. We already have operations in Italy, Spain and the UK and to achieve European leadership we recognise we need to have a presence in the top five markets – with the imminent launch of our German and French operations – we’ll be in the top five and the expansion will contribute to our growth. The travel industry has had a rough few years – with the pandemic bringing it to a halt, to a lot of criticism this summer as the industry bounced back. How did WeRoad navigate the lockdown days? During the first lockdown with leisure travel virtually impossible and our sales plummeting to zero, we continued to engage with our community and our interactions with our followers played a key role in keeping us afloat. Leveraging our social media presence we essentially initiated a pre-order strategy with unexpected returns. And particularly so given the nature of our product: long-haul tours for groups of people that don’t know each other, and tours all about sharing and connecting with the local population. At the time this went completely against the “social distancing” norms and official curfews imposed to curb the spread of the virus. We had the most “unsellable” product in the world. But we came up with the idea of gift cards for future travel. The results were incredible. In three days we made half a million EUR and what struck me most was not only the 40% who bought the cards were repeaters, but that 60% were new customers. By keeping our community engaged, we were able to leverage word-of-mouth to shore up the cash needed during our darkest days and still grow the business. What can the travel sector do to improve its reputation and regain trust? I genuinely believe that the pandemic was critical for the industry but at the same time therapeutic: all companies who went through it, or were born in it, have helped to advance and innovate the sector. Travel dogmas were challenged and a more conscious, positive and constructive discussion has started around the tourism supply chain management, the economic, social and environmental impact of our work, as well as ways of better communicating with the end-consumer. Flexibility is key as is always putting the customer at the centre. What do you think is next in the travel tech space? Disintermediation becoming a reality – as people and touchpoints for inspiration, decision making and booking around travel become increasingly digital. As a result, we will see travel operators becoming more accountable, particularly in relation to their role in the supply chain. The customer experience will also change as a result – seamless, digital and centred around social. Another trend I expect to see next is one built around the experience creator economy and the winners will be those who get hyper-creative, hyper-local and hyper-talented in video and storytelling content. What are the plans for WeRoad in the next 5 years? As above, our ambition is to achieve European leadership by 2025. It will pave the way for the launch of additional side projects and associated businesses. We also want to explore a few new things – the first is creating an opportunity for our coordinators, to create and arrange the itineraries themselves and sell them through our platform. This will serve to make the experience even more unique while also giving coordinators the possibility to work with us on a full-time basis. Currently, the majority of our coordinators have regular jobs and do the coordinator role in their spare time. It also enables our product to scale. Secondly, we feel there is an opportunity and an interest in our product from older age groups – 50+ – and this is something we’re looking to explore further. In relation to our expansion – we’re aiming to open offices in Germany, France, Benelux and the Nordics by next year and potentially targeting the Americas and APAC.

2022.8.24,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/german-startup-dryad-secures-e10-5-million-for-its-wildfire-detection-tech/,"Berlin-based Dryad has raised €10.5 million in new funding. The startup is developing solar-powered environmental sensor networks that provide rapid wildfire detection. Across the globe, one impact of global warming is being felt every summer season with more and more urgency – wildfires. From Europe to Australia, wildfires are happening with more frequency and intensity and are having massive consequences on the environment, people and wildlife. Dryad, a Berlin-based provider of solar-powered environmental sensor networks wants to improve wildfire detection and forest monitoring. The startup has just picked up €10.5 million for its tech. The funding The €10.5 million Series A funding round follows the company’s first equity seed stage, which raised €1.8 million. It saw investment from STIHL Digital. This Series A round was led by eCAPITAL. Additional investors include US-based Toba Capital, Marc Benioff’s TIME Ventures, and strategic investor Semtech. Rapid wildfire detection Founded in 2020 by Carsten Brinkschulte, Marco Boenig, and Cherian Mathew, Dryad has developed an ultra-early wildfire detection and forest monitoring system. It uses low-cost sensors which are solar-powered and operate on a LoRa-based mesh networking infrastructure and a cloud analytics platform. Wildfires are more common than ever before and the impacts are devastating. It’s reported that the wildfires are actually causing 20% of global CO2 emissions, alongside the obvious impacts on habitats, environmental structures and people. Dryad is making a real difference with its tech. It’s enabling rapid and ultra-early detection of wildfires as well as health and growth monitoring of forests, using solar-powered gas sensors in a large-scale IoT sensor network. By taking this approach, the sensors can detect wildfires as well as provide valuable insights into the individual micro-climate and health of a forest. Dr Paul-Josef Patt, CEO of eCAPITAL, commented: “Wildfires represent a huge global problem that has not been resolved effectively for too long. With Dryad’s highly scalable technology, we believe that from now on wildfires will be detected before they can cause damage. We, together with our co-investors, support the company on its mission to save millions of hectares of forest, significantly reduce the threat for humans and animals and avoid the emission of over a billion tonnes of CO2.” This capital injection will be used by the startup to scale its team, push forward its go-to-market strategy and build on the mission to protect the world’s forests – an admirable mission indeed. CEO Carsten Brinkschulte, said: “With high levels of funding secured, and industry expertise to support us, we’ll not only be able to further scale our team and provide critical ultra-early detection but also open the forestry market to the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. We thank all our Series A and Seed investors for their trust in our market-leading technology, helping us deliver on our mission to fight climate change and protect our planet.”"
2022.8.24,eu-startups.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/2022/08/lisbon-based-socialtalk-scores-e770k-to-harness-the-power-of-influencer-marketing/,"Portuguese startup SocialTalk has raised €770k to scale its martech solution that is helping companies harness the power of influencer marketing. The Lisbon-based team is now planning its global expansion. Whilst the job title of influencer or the concept of influencer marketing might not have existed a decade ago, and even then, it’s only been taken seriously in the past couple of years – it’s now an incredibly powerful business area. Companies of all sizes are relying on influencers and the social proof they provide to sell and build brand identity and reputation. Aiming to capitalize in this market – and help companies leverage the power of influence – Portuguese startup SocialTalk has just secured €770k in fresh funding led by Insight Venture. Using AI to bring influencer marketing to all Founded in 2021, SocialTalk wants to democratize the influencer market, bringing companies across the world of all sizes the chance to leverage this powerful marketing assrt. The company’s platform enables companies to quickly find influencers, manage their relationship and monitor their performance, all from one central platform. It’s fully automated and available at a competitive monthly subscription fee. Founders Francisco Ascensão (CEO) and Tiago Oliveira (CTO) created SocialTalk, building on their own experiences in the influencer world. They recognized that influencer marketing is here to stay. The power of recommendation and social proof is proving unequivocal and among the factors that most influence the decision to buy a product or trust a service. Whilst influencer marketing is growing – it’s remained somewhat of a challenge to access and to manage. Working with influencers without the right tech stack has proven to be a consuming and complex task. SocialTalk claims to be able to save about 80% of the time and resources that would otherwise be allocated to influencer marketing. It’s also able to provide more information and metrics, helping teams analyze decisions and strategies. “When we talk about democratization, we mean it. Typically, this is an area whose bill is still quite high for brands. We are following the same path that other areas of digital marketing have already followed. Nowadays, any brand has a CRM to manage customers, software to manage email marketing, social media, SEO, and advertising management, among many other areas. And hundreds or thousands of euros are no longer paid a month as was the case a few years ago. SocialTalk came to disrupt this paradigm. Now any company can have access to all the features  from  €31.00  per  month,  without  false upgrades and usage limits.” SocialTalk uses AI to match profiles with brands – making the process much more streamlined and efficient. According to the team, this addresses the greatest challenge of influencer marketing. “This is the real challenge of Influencer Marketing. We want companies to stop looking for  Influencers. We are developing a recommendation engine that suggests to brands which Influencers they should work with and whose followers fit with the brand’s target audience. But it goes much further than that. We are using Machine Learning to analyze millions of posts daily and help determine the actual performance of each influencer, how much a brand should pay according to the objectives proposed to each Influencer and to automate much of the relationship management process.” The wider aim is to make influencer marketing transition to a sustainable process. The Lisbon-based startup also wants to rethink influencer culture – moving away from any toxic connections and using influencers to better communicate and educate society on sustainability matters. This new funding will be used to grow the SocialTalk team in the tech, marketing and sales departments. It’ll also help internationalize its activity with expansion into new markets lined up – including across Europe, LATAM and the US. Mónica Cameira de Mendonça, CEO of Insight Venture: “This is a disruptive project, in an area that needs innovation and a lot of process dematerialization. We are supporting two founders with enormous experience and a proven model”."
